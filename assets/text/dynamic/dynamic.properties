contentLab.hint.MapDetail_DrawFloor.floorLayer4=The bottom-most floor layer. Setting the initialValue doesn't do anything - the bottom layer always shows through if the total of the above layers is less than 1. (So the value is always effectively 1). The bottom layer cannot be painted for this reason.
contentLab.hint.MapDetail_DrawFloor.floorTiles=controls where is floor and where is not. Paint it!
contentLab.hint.MapDetail_DrawFloorOnly.floorTiles=Where to place floor tiles

contentLab.hint.MapDetail_RandomLamps.lampLightMode=whether to decide to light lamps automatically based on day/night, or to specify chance to light.
contentLab.hint.MapDetail_RandomLamps.numberOfLamps=exact number of lamps to spawn.
contentLab.hint.MapDetail_RandomLamps.overrideSceneryEnvironment=you can use this to override the environment (biome) that the lamps are pulled from. But, most biomes don't define lamps, so iuno.

itemSummary.arcformPike=A mysterious marbled alloy forms the jointless body of this greatspear. Myths say the Elgorn people made such weapons to fight beasts of rock and sorcerers of steel. It's light and cool in the hands, and it's certainly sharp enough.

itemSummary.augment_pauldronBossGladiator=Shoulderguards of Drauven forging, they're undeniably gaudy, the regalia of one who would be champion and rule the arena.

itemSummary.bowBone=A bow fashioned of bones, it has an unpleasant aura.
itemSummary.bowBone2=A bow fashioned of bones, it now glows with the satisfaction of a fulfilled destiny.
itemSummary.bowBossSiege=It's more siege-weapon than marksman's instrument. The draw is stiff and the aim is heavy, designed for the arms of mighty Drauven warriors. But oh, how rewarding to hear it howl when the string is loosed, to watch whole wailing ranks of enemies fall.
itemSummary.bow_messiah=The weapon of the Shadow Messiah is carved from a weird, almost petrified-looking wood that no one can identify. It requires a mighty arm, but delivers immense force with each shot. 
itemSummary.claymore=The prized claymore is not easy to wield. It produces deadly results and headless opponents.
itemSummary.clovenbrand=The first to wield swords like the clovenbrand were slight-framed, light-footed mountain warriors. The many-folded blade needed to be hardy if it was to be unbroken. When it's swung, the wind sings through its hollow like a ghost.
itemSummary.crankbow=A simple cross-bow with a single-handle crank, it can't get the same easy power of a draw-bow, but is easier to aim, and usable in close quarters.
itemSummary.crookstaff=A staff crooked in the tradition of shepherds, it's solid enough for a good thwunking.
itemSummary.crossbowIce=In myth, there was a maker, Apsis, who toiled at a Coldforge under some now-forgotten range. And Apsis must be dead, yes -- but these icecast wonders remain.
itemSummary.crossbowMoth=When the moon's full and cold as a silver coin in a well, it feels like the bow might flit from the hand, to follow light to the place it was born.
itemSummary.cyclonefork=A thundergod showed the plains people how to forge his chosen weapon, and the secret remained in the earth like the kiss of lightning.
itemSummary.daggerMaylen=The blade seems to want to leave sight. It's not moving on its own, is it? Sliding under dressers, sidling among ferns, skittering off to be with other knives, where knives are free? No. No, it just keeps getting dropped, mislaid, and then perhaps kicked by an unwitting foot. That must be all it is.

itemSummary.dirk=A long narrow dagger made for combat, easily concealed and deadly if applied correctly.

itemSummary.flareAxe=These axes are heirlooms of a people who believed the breadth of a blade reflected the honesty of its wielder. There's nothing subtle about its design.
itemSummary.flymace=These cheap, effective maces didn't need high degrees of skill to make or use. Their popularity rose in recent centuries, being a powerful weapon even in the hands of untrained militia.
itemSummary.greatsword=A classic two-handed sword, there's nothing a greatsword does that you don't expect it to do. That doesn't mean anyone can stop it, though.
itemSummary.grimblade=These toothed and heavy broadblades survive from a mostly forgotten age. The magic that went into them still lingers, dark and hungry.
itemSummary.halehammer='To fall on the foe like the ice-god's hale.' This motto is inscribed on each of these carefully crafted hammers, and dates back to Knighted times, when people built cities and raised militaries.

itemSummary.heartwoodstaff=A tall staff carved from the heartwood of a doomed tree, it carries a latent sylvan power.
itemSummary.hunterAssassin1=Nothing's more comfortable on the trail than these prestigious hugs of armor. Originally crafted and composed for renowned guides, and for Drauvstalkers of some means, they consist of doublethick soft leather plates and a fur-lined cuirass, with shirts and leggings of rock-cotton. Strong and freeing, their design is no secret, but the expensive materials comprising them mean they're a prize to come across.
itemSummary.hunterAssassin2=The unique treatment of these hides is said to take 10 years and a whole tub of wraithsalt. Light as fleece, strong as iron, the oily leather that emerges from this process is tricky to work with, and must be interwoven by artisan hands. The result, though, is armor that is both liberating to the limbs and resistant to axe-chew. Rumor is that the wearers of these suits begin to feel an urge, a compulsion... to kill. So. Yeah. Rumors are a lot of fun.
itemSummary.hunterBark1=Townwatchers who are good with a bow, and who can't get anything fancy, have long traded to each other the secrets of graybark. Metal links and scales are sewn into longshirts, traditionally gray leather or canvas, leaving the arms light to draw and fire.
itemSummary.hunterBark2=Thornbark is a proud, ongoing invention of the current era. Plates are fitted so as not to impede firing action, while spell-proofed scales, links, and boiled leather are interlayered, angled to create glancing blows. It takes great craft to add this much weight to an archer without frustrating them, so examples are still quite rare.
itemSummary.hunterClothes=Garments for the trek and the trackless hills. Once, they were worn on simple hunts and foraging loops. Now they're the scant guard on <firstName>'s fang-chased life.
itemSummary.hunterClothesCoathood=Garments for the trek and the trackless hills. Once, they were worn on simple hunts and foraging loops. Now they're the scant guard on <firstName>'s fang-chased life.

itemSummary.hunterClothesWool=Garments for the trek and the trackless hills. Once, they were worn on simple hunts and foraging loops. Now they're the scant guard on <firstName>'s fang-chased life.
itemSummary.hunterNature1=Down lost tracks into green oblivions go some wanderers: those determined to live closer to the plants and beasts, to find brickless, ironless ways to shelter and garb themselves. These traded garments, and the secrets of their make, come from those who return. They do give off a decidedly vegetable smell.
itemSummary.hunterNature2=Among the hillpainters a storied armor is whispered of, and rarely donned. Prescribed materials, proper rituals of craft: these are more an argument among the old than any kind of shared wisdom. Myths paint several heroes into antlered sets like these, heroes with green in their blood, with earth in their flesh, and the voice of the hills upon their tongues.
itemSummary.hunterSwash1=It's known that a traveler so swathed will keep songs in the sweep of their sleeves, blades in the bloom of their trousers. How likely they are to share either... that's always been the risk one runs: asking them to a fire, waylaying them for what's likely a well-stocked pack.
itemSummary.hunterSwash2=From the finewoven surcoat, the silken sleeves and sash, to the show of martial leather and seasonproofed boots, here is the dress of a famed and perilous wanderer. <mf:He/She/They> must surely duck in and out of fables, and could come up the road any morn or midnight, twirling a tuft of hairs from the beard of some forest prince, the braid of some marshbound witch.
itemSummary.hunterTabard1=Country-clate, it's sometimes called, for it can clatter like a set of heavy plate, and stop a blow almost equally well. Cumbersome on the legs, it's not built for mobility, but for steadying the body, and keeping it whole.
itemSummary.hunterTabard2=Tall above the walls of the city-age grew rose-shaped turrets, and among the petals there stood great markswomen and men of that era. Their mail was heavy and beautiful; it included clever steadying jointing to help them aim true. Bedecked in such armor, they had few places to go or dodge to, but the bespelled metals and hidden splinting protected them from all that could reach them.
itemSummary.hunterTraff1=Easy protection is what the day's wildwalkers need. Thick enough to survive the swipe of an unseen paw, light enough so as not to become an encumbrance. Thoughtful sewing can make such armor of hardy scraps.
itemSummary.hunterTraff2=Way Rangers once roamed even the bitterest ranges, slaying terrors on the moors and hills in nights now gone to story. They were the first to assemble travel-fittings meant for pitched combat, and these would become the model for most longwalking hunters in the following age. Carefully matching enspelled leather, cushioning fur, and the right selections of metal girding, their best work was said to make the wearer unhittable. Like fighting a phantom.
itemSummary.hunterVultureAcolyte=The garb of old Graymountain.
itemSummary.hurlaxe=Two throwing axes that shred armor and deal damage.
itemSummary.instrumentString=A cheerful, forgiving instrument, often found onstage or around a campfire.

itemSummary.langblade=A good long sword of extra weight and elegance, with a simple, graceful design.
itemSummary.lantern=A weird old lantern made of blue metal with a foggy glass that holds an unquenchable black flame. It's said that when conditions are right, the lantern may conjure the ghost of an old watchman... spooooky...
itemSummary.leafspear=A spear with a hardwood shaft and a long, well-designed leaf-shaped metal head-piece.
itemSummary.leviathanlance=Hunters of the great leviathans devised such a weapon that few have ever matched. Swung through the air, it screams to match its dragonly prey.
itemSummary.lockbreaker=Named by a hero of old, who swung it to bring down the gates of a tyrant, its weight and edge shear metal as easy as wood.
itemSummary.lumberAxe=Good for attacking something as elusive as a tree, it's simple, solid, and swings heavy.
itemSummary.maceBossFryingPan=This heavy kitchen-tool is not the best choice for eggs, no. But it's an exceptional selection should the chef wish to bust shoulders and break tables--perhaps burn an ungrateful dinnerguest with a splash of scalding oil.
itemSummary.minotaursPride=Minotaurs of the Far Below must've once bent themselves on the forging of axeblades. These fearsome weapons are symbols of power in deep places.
itemSummary.moonspear=Stone-hafted spears like these were made in honor of the moon, in the Ancient Kingdoms of Old Kyor. Old and elegant as they are, they carry a remarkable edge, and are extremely versatile in the hands of a skilled wielder.
itemSummary.mysticBattlemage1=Practicality wins out for some mystics, who find themselves too often in the way of sharp, fast-moving objects. Cobbling together suits of armor that aren't too cumbersome for a caster is a case-by-case, taste-by-taste, trial-and-error sort of job. The results are lifesaving.
itemSummary.mysticBattlemage2=Once it was not unheard of for the mystics of the land to don their own knightly armor. They'd climb atop great garrisons at the gates of cities where thousands richly lived, and turn back tides of the day's destroyers. Such fine and relatively light suits of plate are still found from time to time, buried in ruins and nameless fields of war. Some are still forged new by admiring masters of the current age.
itemSummary.mysticClothes=The outfit that seemed most magelike to <firstName>, the time <mf:his/her/their> adventure started. Whether innate to the costume itself, or owed to <firstName>'s mystical aura, there does seem to be a kind of spellwarding attitude to these old fabrics.
itemSummary.mysticClothesApron=The outfit that seemed most magelike to <firstName>, the time <mf:his/her/their> adventure started. Whether innate to the costume itself, or owed to <firstName>'s mystical aura, there does seem to be a kind of spellwarding attitude to these old fabrics.
itemSummary.mysticClothesCollar=The outfit that seemed most magelike to <firstName>, the time <mf:his/her/their> adventure started. Whether innate to the costume itself, or owed to <firstName>'s mystical aura, there does seem to be a kind of spellwarding attitude to these old fabrics.
itemSummary.mysticClothesHood=The outfit that seemed most magelike to <firstName>, the time <mf:his/her/their> adventure started. Whether innate to the costume itself, or owed to <firstName>'s mystical aura, there does seem to be a kind of spellwarding attitude to these old fabrics.
itemSummary.mysticClothesJacket=The outfit that seemed most magelike to <firstName>, the time <mf:his/her/their> adventure started. Whether innate to the costume itself, or owed to <firstName>'s mystical aura, there does seem to be a kind of spellwarding attitude to these old fabrics.
itemSummary.mysticDrab1=The patched shawl and longshirt of traveling mystics has, through history, informed the common petitioner that magical help is at hand. Thick enough to be road-worthy, this hardy-sewn guise serves better for battle than many might suppose.
itemSummary.mysticDrab2=A longcoat, sewn with well-disguised splinting under its alluring embroidery, is worn over a soft and hardy gown of magically imbued threads. Such has become the honored dress of this age's wild-ranging mystics, who will often rove from town to town, collecting wisdom, and distributing it in equal measure.
itemSummary.mysticDruid1=Under the moon all gathered will be witchingfolk. Mystics native to the wilderlands, and those who find their soughtlives there, who make costumes like these of drabcloth and the local weeds, and seem energized by the strangeness of their own appearance. The garb lets them melt into the land when threatened, so it gets said. To avenge themselves at hours of their own choosing.
itemSummary.mysticDruid2=A grandwitch called the Kestrel haunts the stories. She crafted her attire from ensorcelled fabrics and won favors, from the feathers of elusive giants, and from layers of fogsoft forestweave she spun for her own comfort. She may never have existed, she may have lived twelve times; legends place her everywhere and -when. The resplendent gown of her stories has quietly become tradition among a certain breed of mythversed mystic: them who tread, by choice or exile, the borders of obscurity.
itemSummary.mysticPrimal1=Quiltwarm clothing of this kind is practical tradition in high places, among those who long have dwelled there; often they are shamans who walk the cold rocks. This gowning is proof against harsh weather and little else, but the bled-for furs, the marked-on leathers, and stitching of blessed gut hold latent primal magics that remain callable to a gifted soul.
itemSummary.mysticPrimal2=Ice once fell from the skies. Ice, across the many yonderings that were, and choked the land, and trampled the heat out of plant and beast. In that age, there was a great Wildmagus of hillpainters, and he swore to walk the winter over, and warm away the snow with his own feet if he must. These honorary robes, lined with mountain fur and holy teeth, are woven in his tradition. Natural magics seep liquidly between the mystic and this great mantle.
itemSummary.mysticRobe1=There's a handed round formula for treating fabrics that helps disperse most forms of magical energy. Robes of thus-doused textiles are not cheap, but they're much desired among limit-learning new mystics who appreciate the clothing's fire-resistant properties.
itemSummary.mysticRobe2=These gowns of magical fibers are nearly impossible to weave. It's said the thread tries to take the needle on adventures, that the stitches argue with each other, and need to be convinced towards neighborliness, that the fabric bolts—literally bolts, surfacing as far away as the next town over. The result of the labor, however, is raiment through which full-bodied magic can be channeled. Off these sleeves, unwanted spells will greasily melt.
itemSummary.mysticRune1=At first glance a simple robe and sash, this garbing speaks of bleak centuries past. Sorcerers wandered like stormwinds in that era, and many were sworn to selfish, even terrible aims. Some were more mysterious, committed to ends unseen, touching the world in ways that haven't been guessed. The runic symbols on this robe's tie are either woven originals, or borrowed from that age. Chaotic power lives in their lost meanings.
itemSummary.mysticRune2=These light gowns seem made of breath. Their imitation is rarely achieved, but the originals persist where their wearers' bodies have gone to dust. It's told they belonged to arcanists of ancient generations, prominent people who built palaces of learning, who worked on experimental magic and established an occult idiom long-since wiped away. Unfraying and unfading over the millennia, the comfortable scarving is inscribed with powerwarm sigils that shine under the wild stars.
itemSummary.mysticVultureAcolyte=The garb of old Graymountain.
itemSummary.net=Once per combat, attempt to immobilize an opponent.
itemSummary.netRazor=Woven of ironvine, and barbed with broken bits of blades, it cuts the struggling quarry as they try to free themselves.
itemSummary.nightcross=Of unrivalled craftsmanship, the "Common Man's Law," as this crossbow is affectionately known, is the ultimate assassin's weapon, silent and deadly.
itemSummary.nightshard=They say it was broken off of the night sky by a beaten and bloody vagabond, a past-her-prime hero who was falsely accused, run down by a mob. When she reached up and tore this blade out of the cosmos she found her pursuers disappeared. Like stars into daytime.
itemSummary.oathAxe=By seafaring tradition, the wielder of this axe would swear an oath on each head it claimed to claim another.
itemSummary.oldSword=A notched old thing that's seen better days, it belonged to a relation, once upon a time.
itemSummary.phoenixstar=When they came down from the sunlands, the bird people bellowed and swung these great flails, mowing down the fools who would oppose them. Their craft is a privilege of the few who can master it.
itemSummary.pickAxe=Normally used against rocks and tree roots, it can do some damage if you can connect.
itemSummary.pitchfork=A wood shaft affixed with an iron fork for shoveling hay, it's effective and traditional.
itemSummary.poison=Apply to your weapon as an action.
itemSummary.quakebaker=Starfaring giants once lived here who enjoyed using their hammers to make the earth thrum, and gave rise to mountains, hollowed out valleys. This devastating hammer was made by imagining them.
itemSummary.queenAxe=A line of warrior queens once ruled here, bearing distinctive axes that they wielded peerlessly. These weapons or their replicas have survived, and are prized for their beauty, but also coveted by canny fighters for their outstanding balance and edge.
itemSummary.rakeblade=A light and lovely weapon, slim and delicately balanced, it's perfect for the artful duelist, who uses others' aggression to his own advantage.
itemSummary.rootClub=Hacked from the foot of an uprooted tree, it's heavy and dangerous in the right hands.
itemSummary.rosemace=A lovingly-crafted combat-mace of interlocking metal flanges, for crushing skulls.
itemSummary.sack=A smallish sack with something inside.
itemSummary.scrollFire=Probably got a spell written down here or something. Or maybe a restraining order.
itemSummary.sharktoothAxe=The mountainfolk claim these weapons as their own. They're especially effective at chewing through tough carapaces, common among the beasts and terrors of the rocky cold heights. 
itemSummary.shieldCave=Take 1 less damage from non-flanking attacks.
itemSummary.shieldDragonpaw=An impressive shield that used to belong to an old folk hero. Take 1 less damage from non-flanking attacks.
itemSummary.shieldDrauven=The shield of the Drauven hero is sturdy and bright.
itemSummary.shieldField=Take 1 less damage from non-flanking attacks.
itemSummary.shieldGear=Put together from the pieces of a Morthagi clock tower. Take 1 less damage from non-flanking attacks.
itemSummary.shieldGold=Take 1 less damage from non-flanking attacks.
itemSummary.shieldIce=An evercold shield that freezes the bones of creatures it blocks. Take 1 less damage from non-flanking attacks.
itemSummary.shovel="This shovel will dig... your grave!"
itemSummary.skinningKnife=A thick-bladed knife used for peeling off hides, it's good for the surprise murder.
itemSummary.sleepsinger=The sleepsingers were only ever drawn to put down evil. Their lullabies were cruel and sweet and tender and final.
itemSummary.soupSpoon=Good at serving people soup. I don't know why you think you can cast a spell with it though.
itemSummary.spearBone=A shortspear fashioned of bones, it has an unpleasant aura.
itemSummary.spearBone2=A shortspear fashioned of bones, it now glows with the satisfaction of a fulfilled destiny.
itemSummary.spearBossGardener=There was never a gardener who did not sometimes curse the mouths of critters: the diggers and the gnawers, the winged and the wormlike. And sometimes there are bigger beasts, too, that might eat a garden bare: the gluttons and the robbers, the rambling and the starving. So a frustrated and inventive plant-tender came up with a sure way to dissuade the encroachment of covetous fauna.
itemSummary.spearFen=Made to bend under weight, and not break, its blade blackens to a long and versatile edge, its heft is surprisingly light. A disc-shaped butt helps its wielder walk the sloshy fens. Of an ancient hunter’s tradition, this spear is daggerfast, and deadliest from the dark.
itemSummary.spearForest=This natural-formed spear is tipped with a diamond-hard tip of greenstone, and scents the hands of its wielder with a wonderful woody perfume. It plants saplings in the bodies of those it kills. 
itemSummary.spearGorgon=The spear of an ancient hero-queen, made of an unbreakable glass that swirls with deepsea hues. When swung, it seems to whisper and lowly roar, like a distant ocean, or a crowd of frozen souls.
itemSummary.spectralLantern=Its blue light lays a soft protection upon its bearer.
itemSummary.spellbook=The loopingwords within this book help a speaker make connections: among the Self, the Things, and the Spirits. In anyone's hands, it enables interfusion.
itemSummary.spellshard=This seems magical.
itemSummary.staffAstrolabe=The staff is a traveler. Perhaps first held by one who sent it on its way, to roam the fabric of nineteen stories and lives. In the palm, it eases the path of its wielder, and begs for the road.
itemSummary.staffBossTentacowl=The petriglass rod is heavy. Sorrow cold in its trapped yew core. But strength is there, too: an ancient desire to watch over the natural world, to protect it from abuse and debasement. 
itemSummary.staffDrauven=The staff of the Drauven Hero Vracsel is warm to the touch, its core burning with ancient fiery magics.
itemSummary.staffStarseed=Some say the seeds of stars grow on a pale tree that none may climb. At least part of that myth has been proved wrong.
itemSummary.staffThrixlmind=The spellstrung head of this staff gives off a just-audible drone in sunlight, yet falls silent under moon and star. Then it stands straight and unsupported, as if to watch over the sleep of its wielder. There is a nameless mage, appearing in seldomsaid and tragic myths, who made strange deals with the creatures who walked his dreams. Perhaps, the firelight guess goes round, this would've belonged to him.
itemSummary.staffWinterfur=They say that when a sage goes to the mountains, they either die or become feral, and hide. Staffs like this are heirlooms of those people, who braved rock and element to tangle their hair among the steepest, strangest stones.
itemSummary.starbreaker=Opalescent concavities gorge the star, a result of the hardening treatment that causes weird colors to rise out of the ore, and these clefts can seem to glow, as if a budding star is contained within...
itemSummary.strongbow=Stories say the chosen boughs for these bows were gifted by thankful trees to wardens of the deep woods. The limbs bend willingly, and hold a string like they were born for it, producing a relatively easy draw for the resulting force of each shot.
itemSummary.sunray=In honor of the sun god, these spears were made that may strike in a flash, leaving only a red blur behind.
itemSummary.swanscepter=Swan people swim on lakes, somewhere, and carve amid their own feathers these wands of twisted whitewood. Rare and prized by collectors, they have a spell focusing strength that only a wielding mystic might realize.
itemSummary.swordArc=A reaping sword was needed: in days when hateful necks were many, an edge was made to meet them, and leave them split.
itemSummary.swordAvenger=The blade of an old hero, drawn from stone and wielded in vengeance for the lost.
itemSummary.swordBossMagitaur=A blade broken and shaped from an umbercryst--shadow made mineral--a kind of life-hungry crystal that forms in the hearts of mountains that have been soaked in death. Its edge may divide even the will from the body. 
itemSummary.swordGlacier=It does spark conversation: a greatblade made of ice that can't be marred. It's stood point down in the earth beneath a summer sun, and has not yet melted. Perhaps, as is whispered, it was forged from a comet.
itemSummary.swordThuvayn=A sword passed from slain to slayer, its perfect balance is undeniable, its myth dark and worrisome. It will never rest, but be orphaned, again and again.
itemSummary.swordWing=There were those who lived among the terrible Crag Eagles, when metalmaking was a young art. And they crafted swords. They ruled the high places.
itemSummary.thanefeller=These axes appear simple, but their design is an ancient, guarded secret from the Thane Wars. Deadly and pleasant to swing, they sing in the air.
itemSummary.throwingKnife=Three throwing knives that deal extra damage if flanking.
itemSummary.thumpstick=From a certain Yondering’s history sailed the Elnish watergoers, warriors who fought steel with hardened oak, and drank many a battle’s victory-draught as they sang and knifed the ocean’s breadth in their proud ships.
itemSummary.titansfist=These huge stone clubs are often found with their hafts buried, their heads upright on the earth like gravemarkers. Folklore has it that any who can lift one is destined to bring down the towers of the great.
itemSummary.torch=Light some fires!
itemSummary.vigilkeeper=These weapons are said to come from the tradition of the ancient Elgorn rangers. They guarded this world from rogue gods in bygone times, and their bows have a unique design that eases the archer's arm at full draw, allowing patience before the release.
itemSummary.walkingStaff=Isn't this literally just a gnarled branch you picked up when you were out hiking?
itemSummary.wandGorg0n_t1=It almost wriggles in <self>'s hand.
itemSummary.wandGorgon=The silverysmooth petriglass is heavy and cold. There are times... it almost seems to wriggle in the hand...
itemSummary.wandLantern=Across the night, across the clouds, across the brands and smoke of crowds, a lamp was raised and never dimmed. Still, it stays alight.  
itemSummary.wandPine=There's a humble and inexorable purpose in this wood, in these bright needles that bend and never break. The task is unending, and the tool evergreen.
itemSummary.wandStarseed=Some say the seeds of stars grow on a pale tree that none may climb. At least part of that myth has been proved wrong.
itemSummary.warpblade=Glyphs glow on a black blade of petriglass, survivors of a dead script that has no identifiable cousin or reference. The words change with each draw of the knife, cycling through a collection of eventually familiar shapes. Its edge can be wielded across empty distance, to strike from nowhere, to find even a cowering mark.
itemSummary.warriorClothes=<firstName>'s first effort at armorcraft, these are the hardiest clothes and articles that could be found: stored under stairs, boxed away in the attic, or hanging in the shed among tools of another life.
itemSummary.warriorClothesFurvest=<firstName>'s first effort at armorcraft, these are the hardiest clothes and articles that could be found: stored under stairs, boxed away in the attic, or hanging in the shed among tools of another life.
itemSummary.warriorClothesPeasant=<firstName>'s first effort at armorcraft, these are the hardiest clothes and articles that could be found: stored under stairs, boxed away in the attic, or hanging in the shed among tools of another life.
itemSummary.warriorClothesPoof=<firstName>'s first effort at armorcraft, these are the hardiest clothes and articles that could be found: stored under stairs, boxed away in the attic, or hanging in the shed among tools of another life.
itemSummary.warriorClothesSleeveless=<firstName>'s first effort at armorcraft, these are the hardiest clothes and articles that could be found: stored under stairs, boxed away in the attic, or hanging in the shed among tools of another life.
itemSummary.warriorCoat1=Fine fabrics and leathers that've been coated with resistant tallows, then bound and studded with instilled metals. Once, such costumes were commonplace, when magic flew random from questionable hands. They still hang pleasantly, powerfully, around the right pair of shoulders.
itemSummary.warriorCoat2=There used to tread these roads a caste of hero-grims, bedecked in spellwaxed longcoats. They hunted the powermad warlocks and mystical renegades of a lost and frightful age. In strange places, their garments survive, and can be mimicked by a master maker.
itemSummary.warriorEngraved1=These heavy, bright breastplates have lasted the many generations since their forging. Once standard issue among the Dawnwatch--famous guardians of a crumbling world now gone to dust--they're now found in lightless places, private troves and mossy ruins. They'll still serve well a warrior whose face is turned to danger.
itemSummary.warriorEngraved2=Stories say wallwardens once walked mighty walls, safeguarding vast cities to grow and flourish. Those times are gone, the wardens gone, and the walls mostwheres buried, but these elaborate suits of plate survive. The armor settles comfortably around the wearer, despite or perhaps because of its weight, encouraging a firm stance against the attacker, a forceful reply.
itemSummary.warriorGard1=Hardened leather and a few cushioned studs is what the hill-brawlers wear. Easy to move in, to fight in, and able to soften a slashing edge. To some, the scantly-pieced armor looks like a boast. No one's saying it isn't.
itemSummary.warriorGard2=Traditional armor of the wildwalking barbarians of old, whose codes compelled them to protect peaceful lands and peoples from the encroachment of all the world's hungriest, night-dwelling threats. Composed of artisan-worked leathers with sewn-in discs of metal, all softened with thick fur. It's unrestrictive, eye-catching, and ideal for a confident combatant.
itemSummary.warriorGladiator1=Allweather armor composed largely of leather, it's light enough to be worn for days on end, stout enough for the rocks and thorns. In recent generations, such costumes have become associated with banditry. For someone preparing to survive the roads, bandits would seem a fine example to follow.
itemSummary.warriorGladiator2=This set of treated leathers, studded and ringsewn, pulls on the war traditions of the Thnarrs to both protect its wearer and offer them frightening mobility. "Scothed and hammer-swinging raced Fran to the screaming wall; She stood to be sundered, slaying sixty while her body slackened." Old poems remember these pieces to the world.
itemSummary.warriorMail1=A shirt of chainmail, wrapped in raincloth to prevent rust, and augmented with a few cobbled-on plates. It's not light, it's not pretty, but it's trusty protection for those who'll rove the backcountry.
itemSummary.warriorMail2=Born from the forges of master smiths in recent ages of the world, these suits of unadorned plate are heavy, but not inelegantly so. Sections of naked chain preserve the wearer's mobility, and generous padding beneath is there to soften blunt impacts.
itemSummary.warriorScale1=Easy to shed on a sinking craft, these hauberks were prized at one time by river-raiders, who also perfected their make and use. They offer the wearer ample protection and unique freedom of movement, and are still preferred by some martial experts.
itemSummary.warriorScale2=The oceanfaring Elnish of an epoch long past wore these impressive sets of fur-lined scale. Simple to doff and don, they are arranged with the wearer's balance and bodily power in mind. Such specimens are rare, and difficult to imitate. Many have names already inside of them, and seem to have been recovered from the sites of wrecks and sunken ruins.
itemSummary.wingknife=These daggers were favored by pitfighters and dirty brawlers of the stories, and are seen as a mark of both ferocity and cunning. In skilled hands, they're a confusing and deadly weapon.
itemSummary.wintershard=It's said an ice goddess came from the stars, and the first wintershard was an axe she gave unto womankind. Their evercold blades freeze blood even as they hew limbs.
itemSummary.wyverntail=The spiraling serpentine tail of a wyvern is carved upon its shaft, and its core is said to be fashioned from a wyvern's stinger. Every strike of its fearful blade leaves venom in the wound.
