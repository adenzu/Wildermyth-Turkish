dote_39=An old enemy, the moon, watched <mf:him/her/them> out of the night sky. It nested in its sinister light.
dote_4=<mf:He/She/They> found work <bookish/coward/goofball/healer/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark:in the museum of a wealthy collector/on a farm/in the circus/teaching children/in a taphouse/as a shepherd/painting signs/peddling perfumes/on a streetcorner> for a span of years, <bookish/coward/goofball/healer/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark:sorting and caring for old things/planting and harvesting barley/juggling knives and balancing on wires/giving them the basics of letters and short math/pouring drinks and watching heroes come and go/guiding gray sheep through vales to graze/dreaming of elsewheres and anywheres and whoever might be there/flattering fat nobles and flirting with the finer few/crying out obscenities until paid to shut up>. It was a living, but <mf:he/she/they> couldn't do it forever.
dote_40=Employed through the tough years, <hothead/loner/greedy:plowing the huge fields of a well-off farmer/training hounds for a cold-eyed huntsman/tutoring the grubby mean children of an absent family>, <mf:he/she/they> learned to live as much in <mf:his/her/their> imagination as in reality.
dote_41=For some reason <mf:he/she/they> always had nightmares about a place called <Site>. No memory of ever going there, and <mf:he/she/they> hoped never to find it.
dote_42=And though they said <mf:he/she/they> must be a child of prophecy, little was proven false or true.
dote_43=Books became <mf:his/her/their> favorite treasure. Books, <mf:his/her/their> <coward/healer/loner/poet/romantic/snark:cottony pillow against life's wooden truths/hope for meaning in a world of suffering/quiet sanctuary in a world raucous with ignorants/clear-scrubbed windows through which the world would show itself. Artless/trysts with truth when the world got mean and every eye skeptical/only source of solace and sometimes sanitary napkins>.
dote_44=The treasures of traveling mystics always drew <mf:his/her/their> eye. <coward/hothead/leader/poet:Transfixed by their apparent power,/Entranced by their mysterious luster,/Awake to their power,/The way they sang with power,> <mf:he/she/they> developed a quiet longing to lay hold of them. The ache only grew.
dote_45=And <bookish/healer/loner/romantic:standing under constellations/speaking through a mirror to the ghost of <mf:his/her/their> young self/wandering alone among mountaintops/watching two old enemies marry in their twilight>, <mf:he/she/they> saw life's mysteries as a tapestry, wholly connected. In every day there hung the opportunity to unravel a piece or thread.
dote_46=Failing at almost everything, <mf:he/she/they> <bookish/healer/hothead/romantic:retreated into trusted books/sought solace in fermented fruits/pulled weeds and picked fights/traded coin for cheap love>. However <goofball/leader/poet:a bright spirit/a true hero/a hopeful heart> abided beneath the layers of misfortune.
dote_47=Long fond of town life, <mf:he/she/they> got sucked into a journey once with a small caravan of tradesfolk. Ever after, <mf:he/she/they> tended to seek the road when life under a roof grew stagnant.
dote_48=Supposedly <mf:he/she/they> spent years in a very distant city. The story went that <mf:he/she/they> <healer/hothead/greedy/goofball:acquired most of <mf:his/her/their> obscure knowledge in a fabled university, from the people <mf:he/she/they> met there and from the books there gathered/got into endless dust-ups with the law there, that it taught <mf:him/her/them> toughness and showed <mf:him/her/them> the merit of <mf:his/her/their> own talents/learned <mf:his/her/their> way with money from working among the endless shops and avenues there, not all of them savory/rode the tides of fashion and was famous for a time, mixing lips with the hotblooded, young, and free>. <mf:He/She/They> often wrote of such things, whether or not they were true.
dote_49=<mf:He/She/They> <coward/bookish/leader/romantic:was once apprenticed at a smithy/practiced a few years in a chemist's workshop/survived six seasons as a riverguide/spent too long in a sculptors' guild>, where <mf:his/her/their> enthusiasm was always far greater than <mf:his/her/their> skill.
dote_5=<mf:He/She/They> used to go to a mountain three or four times per year, to honor <mf:his/her/their> dead parents. As time passed, <mf:he/she/they> made the pilgrimage less and less.
dote_50=<mf:His/Her/Their> <mf:boy/girl/child>ish face caused folks to <healer/leader/loner:coddle and protect/underestimate/ignore> <mf:him/her/them>. This was how <mf:he/she/they> <coward/leader/loner:liked it/preferred it/liked it>.
dote_51=<bookish/romantic:The picture of obliviously perfect/Flourishing into the plum of> <mf:manhood/womanhood/personhood>, <mf:he/she/they> <bookish/loner/romantic:found many partners for illuminating conversation, but could never figure out why all of them happened to be/was increasingly harrowed by blind admirers, and grew to generally mistrust the intentions of/grew bored with the ease of the dance, and began to shun most> <mf:women/men/people>.
dote_52=An amorous clay-spirit once offered <mf:him/her/them> a wish. Or so <mf:he/she/they> used to claim, and that's how <mf:he/she/they> explained <mf:his/her/their> enormous... well...  Anyway, the attention <romantic/loner:was always something <mf:he/she/they> liked./always felt like a curse.>
dote_53=There was often a strangeness in <mf:his/her/their> face, as if <mf:he/she/they> harbored some impossible notion, was in fact on the cusp of expressing it...! May as well try to pry moonlight from a fox's eye: no one would ever know what <mf:he/she/they> held back.
dote_54=<bookish/hothead/healer:The sea called <mf:him/her/them> to spend foamy years aboard a good humming vessel. By charts and stars, <mf:he/she/they> grew hardy and strong./Desert winds pulled <mf:him/her/them> into an arid life that revolved around sun and moon. The sands scoured <mf:him/her/them> into something strong./Rivers spelled <mf:his/her/their> name in their great looping letters, and years rolled by, accompanied by driftwood downstream. <mf:He/She/They> became hardy and <mf:handsome/beautiful/gorgeous> to those who knew the water.>
dote_55=From the curt tales <mf:he/she/they> told of life on the road, odd jobs and strangers treated <mf:him/her/them> poorly, left few good memories to dwell on.
dote_56=An old hero taught <mf:him/her/them> the blade, saying there could be no future without those prepared to fight for it. First, to practice for it.
dote_57=<mf:He/She/They> worked as <hothead/leader/romantic:a cheap sellsword/a manor guard/a caravan escort> at one point in <mf:his/her/their> life. <mf:He/She/They> earned modest pay, <hothead/leader/romantic:and learned that life costs less to most folks than a new pair of shoes/and developed a more realistic outlook on the divide between rich and poor/and realized rather quickly there are no secrets in a wagon-train>.
dote_58=<mf:He/She/They> once spent a summer in a large house, <mf:footman/maid/cleaner> to a <awm:noblewoman/nobleman> and <awm:her/his> estranged <awm:daughter/son>. By autumn <mf:he was/she was/they were> running for <mf:his/her/their> life. At least <awm:mother and daughter/father and son> were speaking again!
dote_59=<mf:He/She/They> nursed a regret - <mf:he/she/they>'d never journeyed to the Northlands, <healer/leader:where a lost branch of <mf:his/her/their> family was said to have dwelt/to see the marble cities and mingle among the noble folk <mf:he/she/they> thought must inhabit them>. But time went by, and the opportunity never seemed to materialize.
dote_6=<mf:He/She/They> stood on <leader/poet:walls/hilltops> whenever <bookish/hothead/leader/loner/snark:the written word failed <mf:him/her/them>/lightning kissed fire to the world/the moonshy distance clung to sunset/summer rain blew gently down/<mf:he/she/they> got the old desire>, and wondered what it is to truly love.
dote_60=One thing they said about <mf:him/her/them>: <mf:he/she/they>'d be the first to walk away from a pointless brawl. And that held pretty much true.
dote_61=<mf:He/She/They> wandered the deep wilds of <mf:his/her/their> own choice, <coward/healer/snark:a challenge to the terrors lurking inside/looking for answers to questions that had always bothered/basically because living among people had started to annoy the hell out of> <mf:him/her/them>. And one day, <mf:he/she/they> returned.
dote_62=An abiding love blossomed in <mf:him/her/them> for the natural world. <mf:He/She/They> found peace in the roofless chapels of hills and groves.
dote_63=Rumor was, <mf:he/she/they> once stopped a man from killing another by throwing <mf:himself/herself/themself> in front of the blade. It didn't seem too farfetched.
dote_64=<mf:He/She/They> went through phases when <greedy/romantic/hothead:games of chance were all that enthralled/only the theater could amuse/a rough hot brawl was the only thing that excited> <mf:him/her/them>. <mf:He/She/They> <greedy/romantic/hothead:put money on anything/visited every playhouse/wrestled anyone> <mf:he/she/they> <greedy/romantic/hothead:could make odds for/could procure tickets for/could goad>.
dote_65=Though many around <mf:him/her/them> <bookish/healer/hothead/poet:studied and sought knowledge/turned to baking and hearthkeeping/took up practice with a blade/trained at music or some other art> for the simple sake of their livelihoods, <mf:he/she/they> saw it as a meditation, a means of exploring <mf:his/her/their> innermost self.
dote_66=<mf:He/She/They> found no object so pure and beautiful <bookish/goofball/hothead/loner/poet/romantic/snark:as the printer's solid press/as the rounded coin/as the true-balanced knife/as the well-carved flute/as the calligrapher's brush/as the willowharp/as the drinking horn>, and spent memorable years devoting <mf:himself/herself/themself> to the arts of its manipulation.
dote_67=<mf:He/She/They> fought <mf:his/her/their> longtime friend for the favor of a local <awm:beauty/heartthrob> and was soundly beaten. The humiliation ended their friendship, and sent <mf:him/her/them> far to wander.
dote_68=Militia life fit awkwardly on <mf:him/her/them>. <mf:He/She/They> <bookish/hothead/goofball/healer/leader/poet/romantic:had to engage <mf:his/her/their> mind with private projects and thought-games just to stay sane/grew resentful of <mf:his/her/their> peers who would go into town and behave like animals, only to flee to the safety of the troop when morning came/displayed a knack for undermining anyone who thought they held authority/found too many of <mf:his/her/their> peers to be bullies, especially when they all got together/realized fairly quickly that many of <mf:his/her/their> peers were little better than bandits/disdained the rigid methods and routines of an organized troop/always felt <mf:he was/she was/they were> meant to follow a more mysterious path, one that twisted and lurched among romances and betrayals>. <mf:He/She/They> deserted, one rainy night, leaving friends and oaths behind.
dote_69=Life in the militia wasn't wholly bad or good. <mf:He/She/They> lived often on scant rations and stale jokes, but <bookish/coward/goofball/romantic/snark:at least there was plenty of time to read/there was no safer feeling than being one among many/every once in a while a great laugh would go up and transform them all into a vast unbreakable family/at least the uniform was flattering/at least it was impossible to sleep and you always got sick with whatever nasty disease was rolling through camp. So... but...>
dote_7=<mf:He/She/They> once took refuge in the home of an ancient <mf:hunter/huntress/hunter>. <coward/hothead/leader:Maniac twinkles lit the <mf:man/woman/person>'s failing eyes as <mf:he/she/they>/Through long rocky breaths and addled contradictions, the <mf:man/woman/person>/Old but unfaded, and proud as a dragonslayer, the <mf:man/woman/person>> told tales of exploring this uncharted country.
dote_70=Taking up with <goofball/hothead/poet:a troupe of thieving acrobats/a mercenary band in the west/a small guild of favored poets>, <mf:he/she/they> enjoyed what <mf:he/she/they> had: coin, comradery, pride of craft. But <mf:he/she/they> couldn't shake the feeling <mf:he was/she was/they were> missing something. Something important.
dote_71=<mf:He/She/They> <charisma.50:used <mf:his/her/their> charms to lure a wealthy <awm:woman/man> in <mf:his/her/their> youth. But the old toad proved wiser than expected.../attached <mf:himself/herself/themself> to an old wealthy <awm:leopardess/lech> for a time, until the <awm:woman/man> caught on to <mf:his/her/their> game>.
dote_72=Typically, <mf:he was/she was/they were> to be found at sweaty taverns throughout <mf:his/her/their> youth, trading insults, kisses, fists, and flagons with other sweaty patrons.
dote_73=<mf:He/She/They> grew fond of the wheezing has-beens who frequented the <bookish/hothead/greedy:libraries/saloons/markets> of <Hometown>. Their stories of heroism only got better <bookish/hothead/greedy:in the quiet company of still older legends/as empty cups slammed tabletops, ever flowing full again/in the shrill light and bright cries of hawkers>.
dote_74=The gales of the north <coward/leader:hills/mountains> always <healer/hothead/snark:steadied/blew clear/lifted> <mf:his/her/their> heart. <mf:He/She/They> would visit the <coward/leader:hills/mountains> in the autumn when they sang, and write down the revelations that came to <mf:him/her/them>.
dote_75=Asked to describe <mf:himself/herself/themself> in a word, <mf:he/she/they> <bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:touched pencil to lip, and stared off/smiled uncertainly, and cast around for the right answer/gazed along the blade of an oiled knife, at a grim blood-promising horizon/laughed, and watched geese vacate the earth/came up with several words to describe people who ask stupid questions/pondered the question, stirring a fire gone low/shrugged and sent a misty sigh at the mountaintops/flipped a coin and caught it, before handing it over/compared an apple to the sun, and then bit in/seemed prepared, and struck a dashing pose atop a sunlit knoll/scowled into the middle-distance>. <bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:'Student.'/'Just one?'/'Dragonbearchainsaw.'/'Aware.'/No one ever asked again./'Trying.'/'Lost, I guess.'/'Shrewd.'/'Ephemeral.

dote_77=<mf:He/She/They> <goofball/leader/poet:lost <mf:his/her/their> dearest friend, a freespirit who loved to laugh and dance and howl at the moon. And/once lost <mf:his/her/their> spirit and fled a pitched battle before the day was decided. And/lost <mf:his/her/their> mind once, and wandered from town to town, shoeless and aimless and mute. One day, <mf:he/she/they> woke up and felt better. But> after that, <mf:he was/she was/they were> never quite the same.
dote_78=<mf:He/She/They> stood <mf:his/her/their> ground to an outlaw, once, only to watch <mf:the man/the woman/the outlaw>'s gang murder those who stood around <mf:him/her/them>. <mf:He was/She was/They were> let live, bidden to remember the price of heroism.
dote_79=<healer/hothead/loner/goofball:A wise mountain god/A wolf-headed lumberjack/An unspeaking buffalo woman/A tribe of mushroom people> sheltered <mf:him/her/them> for a magical season. <mf:He/She/They> promised to make <mf:his/her/their> way back one day, but would <mf:he/she/they>?
dote_8=<mf:He/She/They> claimed to have found warmth in the arms of a lostling one winter when <mf:he/she/they> fell and was buried in snow. This shadowy being pitied <mf:him/her/them>, cradled <mf:him/her/them>, and <coward/loner/snark:burned with animal comfort/sang ancient lullabies/snored like a bear> in the cold, blind night.
dote_80=The story goes that <mf:he/she/they> used to pursue every <awm:attractive woman/good-looking man> <mf:he/she/they> came across. <mf:He/She/They>'d fight and dance and steal jewels to win their favor, only to grow bored when their affections were <mf:his/hers/theirs>.
dote_81=For years <mf:he/she/they> earned bread as a guide on the edge of a marsh, showing travelers through muck and mist to the other side.
dote_82=A <awm:rough strong/rugged wiry> beasthunter took <mf:him/her/them> under <awm:her/his> wing, taught <firstName> all <awm:she/he> knew about seeking dangerous prey. Also, something of the passion of lonesome people.
dote_83=<mf:He/She/They> never tried to hide <bookish/hothead/greedy:the burnmarks wrapping/a grizzly scar that marred/the blackened patch of skin on> <mf:his/her/their> <coward/leader/goofball:back/arm/neck>. Asked about it, <mf:he/she/they> <poet/romantic/snark:explained there were things in the past too heavy to dredge up/only smiled and claimed that one taste had been worth it/always offered to show you exactly how it had happened>. Folks were forced to leave it at that.
dote_84=There was a place <mf:he/she/they> sometimes went to see <mf:his/her/their> favorite things: <healer/romantic:wild herbs and pillows of clover/gooseflower runnels>, <leader/greedy:dandelions with frothy heads full of dreams/seams of blackberries>, <goofball/snark:treetops scraping stars off the sky/a place to hold court with pasty moths and a geriatric red fox>. <mf:He/She/They> survived roofless among these beauties for years.
dote_85=<mf:He/She/They> endured a lull filled with uneventful labors, before adventure finally called.
dote_86=<firstName> sought a simple existence <coward/leader/greedy:on the shores of Long Lake/among galleries of tall trees/where scarves of wild heather dressed hill and field>. It was a place <mf:he/she/they> dreamed of staying, but <mf:he/she/they> never quite managed it.
dote_87=Apparently, <mf:he/she/they> got thrown in jail several times. Small crimes, here and there. <mf:He/She/They> only seemed sorry to have been caught, and would later remember friends <mf:he/she/they>'d made behind bars.
dote_88=It wasn't hard for <mf:him/her/them> to dodge along, <romantic/greedy:taking both sides of any argument. Some people just have that charm./telling fortunes and selling charms. People are easy, <mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> say. They're hoping to be convinced.>
dote_89=Spending years on the road as a grown <mf:man/woman/person>, <mf:he/she/they> most regretted the times <mf:he/she/they> <coward/bookish/hothead/loner/poet/romantic:had to steal from those who had shown kindness/encountered the ill or injured, and could do nothing for them/left a stranger bloodied who had only been starving and addled enough to steal/avoided meeting folks. Could've been anyone. Could've changed everything/failed to stop. Failed to notice trees, blossoms, or listen to the birds mourn lost seasons/promised the world to a flattered stranger, for the sake of a night not alone>.
dote_9=One bad year, <mf:he was/she was/they were> snowed in inside a mountain village. Bandits raided through the winter, and in the ensuing cold and widespread starvation, most of the townspeople perished. <firstName> was one of the few to claw gauntly on.
dote_90=<mf:He/She/They> wasted a year near <Site>, fascinated with the scene of some storied atrocity, an old crime of passion gone unsolved. <mf:He/She/They> would continue to wonder through the details for the rest of <mf:his/her/their> life.
dote_91=<mf:He was/She was/They were> the hunting partner to one <awm:Lady/Lord> <bookish/coward/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/snark:Keldwyn/Fudge/Ferndell/Frustrum/Brightwall/Vanderkink/Longshadow/Greenfeld/Moneywad - it was something like that -> for three years. <mf:He/She/They> would <healer/poet/snark:smile to remember/sigh and recall/smirk and insist>: a woodland romance flared in their seclusion, but familial realities forced them apart.
dote_92=Life among rogues was fun. They <leader/hothead/healer:shared laughter and profit/fought and drank in restless competition/always found a way to turn their talents to the public good, which was important>. But <firstName> knew after a while that <mf:he/she/they>'d outgrown it. <mf:He/She/They> moved on.
dote_93=They say that <bookish/coward/hothead/leader/greedy/healer/snark:a studious and unassuming/a fleet-footed/a clownish and capering/an honest-eyed/a silver-tongued/a shy but salacious/a sharp-tongued and cynical> <mf:boy/girl/child> who looked a lot like <mf:him/her/them> once tricked a mountain <mf:goddess/god/god> out of <mf:her/his/their> icy <mf:tiara/crown/crown>. <firstName> never commented on the story...
dote_94=<mf:He/She/They> slew <coward/poet/hothead/loner:a mean-tempered rabbit/one of the great shaved yetis/some random bugbear/an enormous serpent> once. Saved a <awm:winsome maiden/gorgeous princeling>. Snagged <mf:himself/herself/themself> <bookish/healer/romantic:an arcane diary/a thanatic tincture/a magic cloak> or two. So, let's see. What else did old <firstName> do?
dote_95=Rumor went round that <mf:he/she/they> <hothead/greedy/poet:once slew a faerie with a wayward arrow. <mf:His/Her/Their> penance was to live a hundred years trapped inside a dog's body, before being set free/lived for years among a family of bears, teaching them dancing, language, and fire/once traded sonnets with a mysterious poet from the far southern empires, the two locked in love, never meeting>. No one asked <mf:him/her/them> whether it was true. The story was enough.
dote_96=<mf:He/She/They> often rose to watch the wild lands at dawn. <mf:He/She/They> <bookish/goofball/hothead/romantic:read pages of dead poets while the world woke around/sometimes wondered if the wilderness watched/called it the only smile worth seeing/thought of the arms that once had wrapped> <mf:him/her/them>.
dote_97=<mf:He/She/They> trapped beasts for a time among the stony hills of <Site>. <mf:He/She/They> would release them, taking only a <goofball/greedy/hothead/loner:toe/fang/claw/tooth> from each to weave on a cord.
dote_98=Some of the best days were the quiet ones <mf:he/she/they> spent with a young sick <goofball/greedy/poet:wolfkeeper/herb-grower/bird writer> living out <awm:her/his> final days. Until the <awm:girl/boy> died, there were these things: simple meals, the warmth of a cabin, fire, compassion, and purpose.
dote_99=After studying <coward/healer/hothead/greedy:mountain orchids/the forms of water/historical battlefields/cardplayers> closely over many years, <mf:he/she/they> found <coward/healer/hothead/greedy:a kind of latent power in the geometries of plants/ways to keep ice alive for years at a time, or bring steam from a stone/no position was ever impregnable, nor plight indefensible/all truths are scribbled on the body, be it in the eyes, the hands, the feet, the lips>. That knowledge served <mf:him/her/them> well.
dote_hook_Shame_stoneHero=One year, an awful illness, Igochorra, infected <firstName>'s father. <mf:He/She/They> and <mf:his/her/their> <npc.mf:brother/sister/sibling> set off to obtain a mystical cure, but met with disaster. <firstName> was turned to stone, and <mf:his/her/their> <npc.mf:brother/sister/sibling> barely escaped alive.  
dote_hook_Wanderlust_warrior=Life made them tough, but <firstName> <personality:never lost <mf:his/her/their> curiosity, <mf:his/her/their> love of learning and literature that made <mf:his/her/their> mind strong and kept <mf:his/her/their> eyes open/carried a sweltering fear: that all <mf:his/her/their> journeys and misdeeds would leave only a heap of regrets in the end/never lost <mf:his/her/their> willingness to laugh, to find light even in the darkest of moments/wasn’t satisfied.

Strong of body, sharp of mind, <mf:he/she/they> felt a responsibility to make things easier for others/couldn’t be grateful. Not for a long time. In truth, an abiding anger at the parents who left <mf:him/her/them> would stay, all <mf:his/her/their> life/made more of it than even <mf:his/her/their> <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling> expected. Strong-willed, <mf:he/she/they> forged a way ever-forward, knowing that no journey can end before you’ve walked every step/kept all the struggle and fear contained within <mf:himself/herself/themself>.

Still, a latent longing remained to find something worthy of <mf:his/her/their> lasting faith>.

mote_37=<mf:He/She/They> fought for <mf:his/her/their> friends.
mote_38=<mf:He/She/They> fought to bring glory to <mf:his/her/their> family.

mote_40=<mf:He/She/They> dreamed of <healer/poet/romantic:crossing a bridge. The bridge would arch over memory's sea, into <mf:his/her/their> childhood where the pain seemed to come from. <mf:He/She/They> would cure it./opening a window. The window would gaze out on creation, and <mf:he/she/they> would understand everything./meeting <awm:a star-haired princess/a star-dimpled prince> who would hold <mf:him/her/them> to <awm:her/his> chest until eternity unraveled.>
mote_41=Power was what drove <mf:him/her/them>. The desire for more of it. The enjoyment of its many fruits.
mote_42=<coward/healer/romantic:Nameless whispering fears/Mysteries out of the past/The phantoms of beautiful strangers> seemed to drift around <mf:him/her/them>, goading <mf:him/her/them> onward.
mote_43=Nothing pleased <mf:him/her/them> like <bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/poet/snark:a cloying wine/too much liquor/a river of mead/a jug of whisky/a cup of stars/a stupifying draught> and a <healer/leader/loner:healing/fiery/slaking> night with a stranger. <mf:He/She/They> lived for the promise of these things.
mote_44=<hothead/loner/greedy:Smoke spiraled in/Clouds swept over/A shy sad something flickered in> <mf:his/her/their> eyes when <mf:he/she/they> spoke of the past. Something must have happened for which <mf:he/she/they> sought <bookish/healer/leader:absolution/forgiveness/redemption>.
mote_45=<mf:He/She/They> chased luck across the span of maps. Even managed to catch it once or twice...
mote_46=<mf:He/She/They> claimed to be chasing something, or someone. But perhaps <mf:he was/she was/they were> the one running away...
mote_47=The more others questioned <mf:his/her/their> motives, the <goofball/loner/snark:less clear/more worrisome/more obscene> they often got.
mote_48=Intent on tying together a crowded and confusing past, <mf:he/she/they> chose an adventurer's life.
mote_49=Waking one day from a dream <bookish/healer/goofball/loner/romantic/snark:of a hidden reliquary where foundling treasures lay kept/of fisherwomen trawling some strange violet shore/of a gray riddling lynx who grinned and swatted clouds/of shadowy lands and a rain of strawberry stars/of a great masquerade in a redwood ballroom, figures pointing to firefly chandeliers/about wandering intensely>, <mf:he/she/they> got an intense desire to wander.
mote_5=<mf:He/She/They> sought friendships, lovers, and laughter on the long road through life.
mote_50=<mf:He/She/They> obsessed over <mf:his/her/their> studies on <coward/goofball/healer/leader/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:Yondering predators, and how best to avoid them/the elaborate pooings of rare beasts/medicinal reagents gleaned from the hides and haunts of magical creatures/battling and subduing the most perilous of beings/the misunderstood societies of monstrous races/the emotional capacity of various known monsters/the mating habits of monsters and magical beings/monsters and how to annoy them considerably before they kill you>. <mf:He/She/They> never missed a chance to gather first-hand data.
mote_51=<mf:He/She/They> wanted a boat out on the ocean. Then <mf:he/she/they> would simply sail away...
mote_52=<coward/leader/poet:Afraid to die young and be forgotten/Worried that youth would yield no great deed or memory/Feeling youth's fire wane>, <mf:he/she/they> sold everything <coward/leader/poet:to seek friends and adventure/for a chance at glory/and stoked the dying flames on journeys and dreams>.

Still, in the meantime...
mote_54=<mf:He/She/They> didn't have much of a reason to fight. <mf:He/She/They> never needed one.
mote_55=<mf:He/She/They> hated feeling weak. So <mf:he/she/they> kept training, trying, changing.
mote_56=<mf:He/She/They> would smile and speak <coward/healer/goofball/leader/poet/snark:of the hummingbirds who sank and rose among red blooms/about a thousand gardens growing on the other sides of clouds/of an alarming litany of memorable childhood mischiefs/of the wolves who roamed the stars and hunted demons in the night/of gold lions that sleep on distant shores/on the near end of all creation>. It seemed to fill <mf:him/her/them> like bread and milk, as if <mf:he/she/they> could subsist on that thought alone.
mote_57=Embers of <bookish/hothead/poet/romantic:old legend/a ceaseless fury/bardsong/wayward longing> kindled <mf:his/her/their> spirit. <mf:He/She/They> strode blazing towards glory.
mote_58=<mf:He/She/They> often felt like <coward/healer/loner:a leaf on the water/a feather in the wind/a bud of burnless smoke>, wayward and without reason.
mote_59=Many shrink from the call of destiny, but <mf:he/she/they> never saw the use. <mf:He/She/They> accepted <mf:his/her/their> place in the world, and strove to make the most of it.
mote_6=<mf:He/She/They> always wanted to be a <mf:father/mother/parent>, to raise <goofball/hothead/loner/greedy/poet:affable and unburdened/tough and sturdy/self-reliant and starseeking/smart and worldwise/beautiful and soulful> <bookish/healer/leader/snark:young scholars/kids in good health/little heroes/little dopplegangers>.
mote_60=<mf:He/She/They> didn't insist on a single goal or idea. Just <bookish/leader:persisting/surviving>, <goofball/healer:laughing/learning>, <loner/romantic:honoring the time/enjoying the love> <mf:he was/she was/they were> given.
mote_61=<hothead/romantic:Set on someday living in/Eager for a life of> <healer/loner:wealth and comfort/luxurious isolation>, <mf:he/she/they> sought <mf:his/her/their> fortune in the vast unknown.
mote_62=To prove <mf:himself/herself/themself> in the eyes of <mf:his/her/their> <bookish/leader/poet:theoretical/eventual/someday> <awm:wife/husband>, <mf:he/she/they> <goofball.50:began organizing a fabulous collection of dolls/pursued glory, fortune, and honor>.

mote_64=The horizon called <mf:his/her/their> name. <mf:He was/She was/They were> just one of those <bookish/loner/greedy/snark:inquistive/restless rambling/anchorless/impressionless> wanderers.
mote_65=<mf:He/She/They> <healer/romantic:sought to return to/dreamed of revisiting> the past, someway. To set things right, maybe, or just to set them different.
mote_66=<coward/leader/greedy/snark:Leary of owning/A forger and fulfiller of/Often caught making and breaking/Definitely to be trusted with> promises, <mf:he/she/they> <coward/leader/greedy/snark:vowed anyway/vowed/nevertheless vowed/totally would vow> to protect all <awm:winsome women/beautiful men> from harm.
mote_67=<bookish/leader/loner/poet:Disillusioned by/Fatigued with/Brooding over/Stunted and dragged down by> the hard road life had set <mf:him/her/them>, <mf:he/she/they> strove only to occupy <mf:his/her/their> idle hands. And yet, perhaps... perhaps...
mote_68=<mf:He/She/They> always volunteered for the most perilous tasks. Folks often wondered whether <mf:he/she/they> <leader/loner/snark:coveted glory, or merely saw no way around it/trusted anyone to do anything/secretly longed for death>.
mote_69=<mf:He/She/They> <poet/snark:cherished the hope/held secret hope> a <awm:woman/man> would find <mf:him/her/them>.

mote_7=Motivated by the past, <mf:he/she/they> felt charged with <bookish/coward/goofball/healer/leader/loner/greedy/romantic/snark:seeking a higher understanding and passing it on to others/making the world a less scary place to grow up in/spreading smiles to those lips who least knew joy/bringing balm to pain wherever it lingered/showing others how to live with honor and dignity regardless of circumstance/safeguarding those wild places where peace could yet be found/finding common ground among all contentious people/seeing that no one had to go through life all alone/ensuring no one got too blind or contented that they ignored the troubles of the world>.
mote_70=<mf:He/She/They> laid eyes on a few of the <awm:ladies/gents> <mf:he/she/they> would be working with, and the decision to go adventuring was an easy one.
mote_71=<mf:He/She/They> craved <hothead/leader/loner:recognition/fame/redemption>. Adventuring seemed like the best way to get it.
mote_72=Suspicious of a particular member of the company, <mf:he/she/they> stuck around to <goofball/leader/snark:prank and prod the enigma/keep a watchful guard against whatever might come/prove <mf:his/her/their> hunch correct>...
mote_73=<mf:He/She/They> proved loyal to those <mf:he/she/they> fought by, and would never abandon them <loner/poet/snark:despite a lifelong wish for peace and solitude/to face the darkness alone/to their errors and ineptitudes>.
mote_74=<mf:He was/She was/They were> driven to adventure by <mf:his/her/their> <coward/loner/leader/greedy/romantic:need for allies, in a world that grew ever more dark and dangerous/grudging admiration for the brave, and the undeniable wealth that their company promised/lust for excitement and penchant for making powerful friends/desire to meet valorous people, to share in their thoughts and thrills/romantic notion of finding love in the shadow of overwhelming danger>.
mote_75=<leader/loner:A creeping madness gnawed/Demonic voices whispered and rang inside> <mf:him/her/them>. To avoid facing <leader/loner:it/them>, <mf:he/she/they> faced danger instead.
mote_76=Few questioned <mf:his/her/their> <bookish/leader:aptitude or cleverness/contributions or courage>. If anything, they questioned <mf:his/her/their> <leader/greedy:ambitions/intentions>...
mote_77=<mf:He/She/They> promised to <mf:his/her/their> young dying <awm:wife/husband> <mf:he/she/they> would love again. <mf:He/She/They> <hothead/romantic:dove into danger recklessly, hoping to forget or be made to/sought and dared not find it, and battled and drank and wept>.
mote_78=Fighting free from the troubles of <mf:his/her/their> past, <mf:he/she/they> <goofball/healer:saw cause for laughter in even the direst of situations/relished a chance to start fresh in love and adventure>.
mote_79=<mf:He/She/They> sought out <goofball/healer/poet/snark:a punchline for the comedy of/a balm for the pains of/a pathway through the fogged forest of/any meaning or math to give reason to> <mf:his/her/their> life, <loner/greedy:there in the shadow of unknown yonderings/walking in the company of strange lands and people>.
mote_8=Just like <mf:his/her/their> parents, <firstName> always insisted on seeking <hothead/greedy/poet:justice/reparations/fair treatment> for the wronged.
mote_80=<mf:His/Her/Their> best friend died young, leaving a daughter behind. It changed everything. <firstName> fought to <bookish/leader/poet/snark:illuminate and instruct/secure/bring solace to/prevent> the girl's future.<bookish/leader/poet/romantic/snark://// I mean. What's the word? Preserve.>
mote_81=<mf:He/She/They> <leader/poet/romantic:worked/wished/aspired> above all else to free untamed lands from the evils that rattled among them.
mote_82=Romance felt <bookish/coward/goofball/leader:inconsequential/unnecessarily risky/boring/trite and unimportant> to <mf:him/her/them>, in the face of <hothead/poet/snark:danger/duty/seriously, magic exists>. But of course, feelings don't ask permission, and even logic may be overcome...
mote_83=<mf:He/She/They> faced evil <bookish/loner/romantic:out of sheer boredom, frankly/when it grew too blatant to ignore/because facing evil is undeniably sexy>. Though <mf:he/she/they> tried, <mf:he/she/they> couldn't understand the grand oaths and ideas of <mf:his/her/their> fellows.
mote_84=<mf:He/She/They> dreaded growing <coward/goofball/hothead/greedy/poet:careless in the face of danger/so callous as to laugh at misery/insensitive to the endless outrages of the world/too disillusioned to bother with strangers in need/bored and fixed in perceiving the world>. <mf:He/She/They> lost sleep trying to stay <mf:himself/herself/themself>.
mote_85=<mf:He/She/They> should have grown used to watching others <coward/leader/poet/snark:fall under the fiery fangs of nightmares/give their lives for things they believed in/meet their dooms in the austere sight of sun and star/dash their lives out on the rocks of fate>. Instead, the grief and desire to save them only grew.
mote_86=Normally, <mf:he/she/they> would have <hothead/loner/snark:let the fools who wouldn't fight face their own consequences/stood aloof to the suffering of others/remained impartial in the struggle between 'good' and 'evil'>. Truth was, though, <mf:he/she/they> had to <greedy/romantic:earn a living [i]somehow[]/<awm:meet girls/meet guys> [i]somewhere[]>.
mote_87=Anyway, it was <coward/hothead/greedy:never difficult/a simple thing/easy> for <mf:him/her/them> to find motivation. A coin or a kiss, or a steady source of both.
mote_88=<mf:He/She/They> enjoyed <bookish/leader/snark:riddling and fiddling with meanings. It made fighting the odd abomination for a chance at mythic treasures completely worth it/playing the hero, even if it was only a game/being the sardonic one. It came so naturally> to <mf:him/her/them>.
mote_89=Somehow, <mf:he/she/they> knew <mf:he was/she was/they were> <leader/loner/poet:bound for/doomed to a life of/destined for> fame. <mf:He/She/They> <bookish/loner/romantic:couldn't hide the hallmarks of genius/would've preferred quiet anonymity/had a face for portraits>.
mote_9=<hothead/leader/loner:Fueled by passion and hungry for love/Trusting that truer love could be found in the wider world/Wishing only for one kindred soul to be bound to>, <mf:he/she/they> <hothead/leader/loner:lived for the pursuit of pleasure/journeyed in search of it/wandered and imagined>.
mote_90=Why did <mf:he/she/they> throw <mf:himself/herself/themself> at danger? Not even <mf:he/she/they> could <coward/loner/snark:give a satisfying reason/rationalize it completely/fully explain it>. Perhaps the fight was just in <mf:his/her/their> blood.
mote_91=Yes, <mf:he/she/they> <bookish/coward/poet:felt at times encumbered with memory and remorse/often ran from the past/roved sometimes rife with regrets>. But <mf:he/she/they> found <goofball/healer/leader/loner/greedy/snark:a laughing freedom in/a kind of absolution,/a simple kind of courage,/a weird and fitting justice,/a fortifying sense of atonement,/a darkly humorous penance in> facing death beside <mf:his/her/their> friends.
mote_92=Though <mf:he/she/they> tended to be <bookish/coward/goofball/leader/loner:philosophical and cagey about moral questions/unwilling to stick to firm definitions of right and wrong/a little mocking of preachers and piety/uncertain what was right or good/scornful of do-gooders and civic heroes>, <mf:he/she/they> never slowed or stopped fighting. Inaction, <mf:he/she/they> felt, paves the road by which evil rides.
mote_93=Some complained <mf:he was/she was/they were> too fond of attractive <awm:women/men>. <mf:He/She/They> <goofball/leader/snark:laughed it off, since. Well.../couldn't help smiling about it. I mean./shrugged this off. I mean. Yeah?> Why else did people think <mf:he/she/they> put <mf:his/her/their> life on the line?
mote_94=<mf:He/She/They> lost sympathy for those unwilling to help themselves. <mf:He/She/They> would <hothead/snark:often declaim/murmur like a memory>: Life is a <coward/healer/hothead/snark:race, and the slow must take their place/self-guided ship. One must never relinquish the tiller/battle, and the strong deserve their prize/dream anyway. Those who can't handle it ought to wake themselves up>.
mote_95=The land was <greedy/romantic:bountiful/beautiful> to <mf:him/her/them>, and <bookish/healer:edifying/good>. <mf:He/She/They> hoped to convince others to love and protect it as <mf:he/she/they> did.
mote_96=<mf:His/Her/Their> great motivator? Perhaps there wasn't one. For <mf:him/her/them> the allure of adventure lay not in the certainty of one outcome but in the possibility of many.
mote_97=<mf:He/She/They> saw the best minds of <mf:his/her/their> generation go up in flames, burn high, burn out. What was left but to take up their work?
mote_98=The desperate days were just more opportunities for <mf:him/her/them>. <hothead/leader/loner/snark:What would get <mf:him/her/them> chained in times of peace would make <mf:him/her/them> a hero when war came to roost./Admiring eyes would cling to <mf:him/her/them>, and power be thrust in <mf:his/her/their> willing hands./Some climb to heaven on a staircase of skulls./Who doesn't love a good hero? Who would think twice of rewarding <mf:him/her/them>...?>
mote_99=Some full moons, <mf:he was/she was/they were> found shivering by the water in <mf:his/her/their> underclothes. And <mf:he/she/they> would turn and whisper, with damp eyes: <coward/greedy/romantic/snark:[i]I'm afraid.[]/[i]There's always a better way.[]/[i]When you find it. Hold on.[]/[i]I'm cold.[]>
mote_hook_Shame_stoneHero=Many years later, <mf:his/her/their> <npc.mf:brother/sister/sibling> returned beside a hero named <hook>, who'd contracted the same disease and sought the same cure. But <hook> used the miracle remedy to return <firstName> to flesh, and so accepted that the Igochorra would someday claim <hook.mf:him/her/them>. <firstName> would always feel the weight of that, and know <mf:his/her/their> life belonged to both of them.
mote_hook_Wanderlust_warrior=At their last stop, they wound up reluctant members of the Marshcastle Gang, bandits leeching food and coins from local hillfolk. <hook.fullname> and <hook2.fullname> dismantled the operation. Hearing those two speak, <firstName> was inspired to take the next step and be someone better. <mf:His/Her/Their> <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling> returned to the woodland lodge where they grew up, and <firstName> would go to visit when <mf:he/she/they> could.
originChild_1=From an early age, <firstName> <bookish/healer/snark:loved stories of valor and romance. <mf:He/She/They> named all <mf:his/her/their> favorites toys after mythic heroes/was lit with the fancy that <mf:he/she/they>'d find a breathtaking, magic-tinged, everlasting romance out in the wider world/tended to fight losing battles, only to wink <mf:his/her/their> blackened eye proudly afterwards at the blushing <awm:girls/boys> <mf:he/she/they> fancied>.
originChild_10=<firstName> was a smiling <mf:boy/girl/child>, with a contagiously helpful attitude. When there was an argument among the children of <Hometown>, they tended to look for <mf:him/her/<firstName>> to sort it out. 
originChild_11=Wandering off as a <mf:boy/girl/child>, <firstName> would frequently come back home amid moonbeams, having spent the day and dusk in solitude. <mf:His/Her/Their> peers never understood <mf:him/her/them>.
originChild_12=<firstName> challenged <mf:his/her/their> older friends to hundreds of games as a <mf:boy/girl/child>. <mf:He/She/They> rarely won, but this didn't seem to bother <mf:him/her/them>. It was all a kind of exercise.
originChild_13=<firstName> used to like watching stars drop onto the night, like grains of sand. <mf:He/She/They>'d pull <mf:his/her/their> friends along. They'd all go out on the roof, gaze upwards, and wake up together, soaked in dew.
originChild_14=The first <awm:girl/boy> <mf:he/she/they> loved died tragically; it left a mighty crack in <mf:his/her/their> world, through which all youthful hope gradually drained away.
originChild_15=Steeped in rare and wondrous tomes from across the world, <firstName>'s family treasures helped <mf:him/her/them> grow up wise and well-read. <mf:He/She/They> left <Hometown> as soon as <mf:he/she/they> could, eager to unravel mysteries and romances both.
originChild_16=When <mf:his/her/their> parents were away, <firstName> was looked after by an old childless couple who tended gardens. They taught <mf:him/her/<firstName>> much about the essential balance between wild growth and cultivation. 
originChild_17=Other children tended to be jealous of <firstName>. <mf:He/She/They> understood why. Look who <mf:his/her/their> parents were! 
originChild_18=Most understood that <firstName> was born a little different. They all said it was due to the strange adventures <mf:his/her/<firstName>'s> parents had had. Whatever the truth, <mf:he/she/they> left <Hometown> young, and not all were unhappy to see <mf:him/her/them> go.
originChild_19=From a young age, <firstName> showed a penchant for distasteful behavior and a curiosity for the macabre. As <mf:he/she/they> got older, this gradually stopped... or else <mf:he/she/they> just got better at hiding it.
originChild_2=A curious child and a contemplative teenager, <firstName> <poet/goofball:always took pride in <mf:his/her/their> knowledge, and the thoughts and ideas that knowledge sparked. <mf:He was/She was/They were> driven ever to learn more./grew fascinated with all the oddments and souvenirs <mf:his/her/their> parents showed <mf:him/her/them>, and decided early on that <mf:he/she/they> would follow the same adventurer's road.>
originChild_20=Though <firstName> always showed an affable face, <mf:his/her/both> parents were sorry to see how isolated the fame of their exploits and their frequent time away seemed to leave <mf:him/her/their child>.
originChild_21=Stories got told about <firstName>'s parents in <Hometown>. It was unavoidable, and the <mf:boy/girl/child> grew up defending their names, sometimes with words, other times with fists.
originChild_22=<firstName> had <mf:his/her/their> friends, growing up. Not an inclusive group, but they stuck up for their own.
originChild_23=It made sense this child would be whispered over, given the parents <mf:he/she/they> had. <firstName> was destined to be an adventurer from birth, and others were destined to call <mf:him/her/them> hero.
originChild_24=<firstName> was always conscientious about living up to the names of <mf:his/her/their> parents. From a young age, <mf:he was/she was/they were> counted on to make smart, unselfish decisions.
originChild_25=As <mf:boys/girls/children>, <firstName> and <mf:his/her/their> friends were driven to have adventures. To live out stories like the ones <mf:his/her/their> parents spoke of. But one of them got lost playing in the woods, once, and never came home again. Everything changed after that...
originChild_3=<firstName> was born with mischief in <mf:his/her/their> heart, thirst for the next laugh, the next unforgettable story. Most supposed <mf:he/she/they>'d outgrow it, but <mf:his/her/their> parents knew better.
originChild_4=Even when <mf:he was/she was/they were> small, <firstName> had a deeply original way of seeing the world. <coward/hothead:Silence meant <mf:he was/she was/they were> imagining another life, and would soon have a question to chase down./At times, it made <mf:him/her/them> stormy, but others found <mf:his/her/their> moods worth riding out, for all the strange and powerful ideas <mf:he/she/they> came up with.>
originChild_5=<firstName> always had a calm confidence that drew <mf:his/her/their> peers in.
originChild_6=Growing up with famous parents was tiresome to young <firstName>. <mf:He/She/They> learned the family business anyway, of course... What else would <mf:he/she/they> have done? 
originChild_7=As a child, <firstName> tended to shun new experiences. <mf:He/She/They> grew into a flighty young <mf:man/woman/person>, lacking confidence but dragged on by a weird, inexplicable persistence.
originChild_8=No <mf:boy/girl/child> got in as many scuffles as <firstName>, nor attempted as many daring feats for an audience of <mf:his/her/their> baffled peers. <mf:He/She/They> insisted <mf:he/she/they>'d be a hero one day, and it seemed, then, that nothing short of a death would stop <mf:him/her/them>.
originChild_9=Born with an irrepressible sweet tooth, <firstName> also developed a lust for rare and beautiful things, a mind for slanted bargains. <mf:His/Her/Their> friends appreciated <mf:his/her/their> cunning, even though it sometimes got them all into trouble.
origin_1=<firstName> <hothead/leader/loner:retreated into old novels as a <mf:boy/girl/child>, whenever reality couldn't live up to <mf:his/her/their> expectations./spent <mf:boyhood/girlhood/childhood> trading books among <mf:his/her/their> friends, growing wild with all the worlds they imagined./grew up with time on <mf:his/her/their> hands, and hands on <mf:his/her/their> books.>
origin_10=<firstName> and <mf:his sister/her brother/their sibling> got by without their parents. They relied on each other, and would continue to across the distances and time that would one day separate them.

origin_93=<firstName> was born into a <coward/leader/poet:troupe of clowns/band of mercenaries/wandering guild of players>, and <goofball/leader/romantic:had a questionable habit of attacking others' misery with teasing and ungentle jokes/was raised to smile and shrug at transience and trouble/carried on the annoying farce that all of life was some great song and dance>.
origin_94=<firstName> remembered childhood as a perpetual timeout. <mf:He/She/They> <hothead/romantic/snark:could never stay out of scuffles, and frequently duelled other rude children with broomhandles/never finished any chores and always wound up watching the lovers stroll through market square/wasn't cut out for chores or labor. Apparently, not everyone knew this>.
origin_95=Few in <Hometown> were as unpopular as <firstName>, growing up. Maybe that's what drove <mf:him/her/them> to a career in adventuring, despite lacking the spirit for it. 
origin_96=When <firstName> was growing up, the world seemed so <coward/loner:vast/wild> and <poet/loner:beautiful/strange>.
origin_97=It hardly mattered to <mf:his/her/their> parents whether <firstName> <bookish/loner/snark:learned letters or remained ignorant/lived or died/failed or found success>. Perhaps this was what led <mf:him/her/them> to <bookish/loner/snark:the blackest fields of study/brooding and whispering in the night/all that ceaseless sneering and plotting>.
origin_98=Skilled at forging compromises, <firstName> could only credit a childhood among brothers and sisters who had a penchant for <coward/hothead/greedy/snark:accidentally insulting the wrong people/teasing and horse-play/arguing without cause or conclusion/self-serious melodrama>.
origin_99=<firstName> never had a kind word to say about <mf:his/her/their> original hometown, and never mentioned its name. In fact, the closest <mf:he/she/they> got to complimenting it was when <mf:he/she/they> told folks it was 'far away.'
origin_hook_Shame_stoneHero=<firstName> never knew <mf:his/her/their> mother, who left when <mf:he/she/they> and <mf:his/her/their> <npc.mf:brother/sister/sibling> were still young. <mf:His/Her/Their> doting father meant the world to <mf:him/her/them>, and saw a world of potential in the <mf:boy/girl/child>'s eyes.
origin_hook_Wanderlust_warrior=Born to parents who soon abandoned <mf:him/her/them>, <firstName> was raised by <mf:his/her/their> canny older <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling>, <npc3>, with the help of an elder woodsman who died when the two were still young. Growing into adulthood, they traveled and took odd jobs, and tangled with disreputable folks wherever they went.

plot_villain_cvawn_2_1_omen.replacementMystic=Early on in <mf:his/her/their> young adventures, <mf:he/she/they> became apprenticed to the powerful mystic <mystic.fullname>. <firstName> aided <mystic> in seeking answers, in unraveling the mysteries of the Drauven loremaster Drevsnac, as well as in tracking him down. Hearing of <mf:his/her/their> teacher’s death, <mf:he/she/they> went to meet the folks who’d stood beside <mystic> in <mystic.mf:his/her/their> final moments. <firstName> hopes they’ll help continue the work.

plot_villain_cvawn_farmhand=<firstName> was born to country people, during the lengthy peace that followed the twenty-year Drauven conflict. <mf:He/She/They> had a quiet and practical upbringing. <mf:He was/She was/They were> aware <mf:he was/she was/they were> an ugly <mf:boy/girl/child>, <mf:his/her/their> limbs and features ever failing to age in concert. <mf:He/She/They> would always <personality:possess a certain awkwardness, preferring contemplation and books to the lengthy exposure of idle conversation./cling to corners of rooms, cast eyes down, and hang <mf:his/her/their> hair in front of whatever mumbles <mf:he/she/they> managed to emit./make a big joke of it, but there was certainly a fragment of <mf:him/her/them> that would forever be insecure./get a little brusque and demanding with people who could help <mf:him/her/them>, and feel guilty afterwards./put others above <mf:himself/herself/themself>, hoping maybe that they wouldn’t mind <mf:his/her/their> company if <mf:he was/she was/they were> helpful./take unexplained laughter to be directed at <mf:him/her/them>, and was moved by <mf:his/her/their> self-blistering temper to start more than one fight with innocent passersby./take mockery in stride, meeting people’s eyes with a calm that cowed them. Inside, it absolutely did hurt <mf:him/her/them>, though, and <mf:he/she/they> took this for a failing./possess a certain awkwardness with people, preferring trees and animals, even bugs, even just windy grass./reflect on why it hurt to never be looked at, delving into books of poetry and thought, focused on finding a cure for <mf:his/her/their> feeling. Maturing, this self-absorption would become the thing that truly shamed <mf:him/her/them>./try different cuts to <mf:his/her/their> hair clothes, different strategies to disguise <mf:his/her/their> awkwardness. The thing <mf:he/she/they> wanted was love and romance, like in stories. And <mf:he/she/they> grew up convinced <mf:he was/she was/they were> too ugly for it./mock <mf:his/her/their> own looks, even to strangers. The point was to do it before anyone else could. And rather than make <mf:him/her/them> feel better, it made <mf:him/her/their> ashamed of <mf:his/her/their> vanity, <mf:his/her/their> cowardice.> Sturdy in <mf:his/her/their> teenage years, <mf:he/she/they> began a long and fairly aimless career as a farmhand, working first for a garrulous divorced old rancher, before migrating around the territory, accumulating friends and experiences. It seemed life would pass and end this way for <mf:him/her/them>. But when Drauven raided <mf:his/her/their> homeland, <mf:his/her/their> family was burned, <mf:his/her/their> former employers killed or put out of their homes, and many friends, too. <firstName> discovered stubborn fire in <mf:himself/herself/themself>, and a decision to do something ripening in <mf:his/her/their> heart.

villain_cvawn.0.rosterCustomHistory.=<firstName>'s birth brought a welcome stillness to the lives of <mf:his/her/their> parents. <mf:His/Her/Their> father was a quester of ordinary origins, but <mf:his/her/their> mother was a monster-hunter of the Fenspear bloodline. Theirs was a family old as firtrees, whose history was recorded in big black books. On their name hung the ghost of ancient deeds, among them the hunting and slaying of mighty dragons. The Fenspear family lodge sits a couple days' walk from <town>, and <fullName> grew up between both places. <mf:He was/She was/They were> <personality:a studious and dirt-sifting <mf:boy/girl/child>, who relished <mf:his/her/their> ancestral tales./a <mf:boy/girl/child> who never fell from trees--because <mf:he/she/they> refused ever to climb them./an impish <mf:boy/girl/child> who found all the most unlikely ways to endanger <mf:himself/herself/themself>, and took great pleasure in flaunting the possibilities./a pie-scarfing <mf:boy/girl/child> who always was laying hands on things not meant for <mf:him/her/them>./a likable <mf:boy/girl/child>, with a melodious laugh people enjoyed, and a penchant for kindness./a roof-haunting climber who tended to scrap and scare other children. <mf:He/She/They> had a big, sensitive heart, <mf:his/her/their> parents said.

villain_cvawn.1.rosterCustomHistory.=A gaunt, grim <mf:boy/girl/kid> showed up one night to the camp of a small poor performing troupe, a teenager with <mf:his infant brother/her infant sister/their infant sibling> <firstName> in tow. The two stayed in the back of a cart, on the road, but it was only shortly thereafter, passing through <town>, that the older <mf:boy/girl/kid> succumbed to an illness of the blood and was buried there. Two dancers decided to quit the travelling life then, and they settled down and adopted <firstName> as their <mf:son/daughter/child>, raising <mf:him/her/them> in <town> above a rope and ribbon shop they were able to open up, and keep afloat. Despite the circumstances that brought <mf:him/her/them> to <mf:his/her/their> eventual home and family, <firstName>’s childhood was happy. <mf:He was/She was/They were> a lanky <mf:boy/girl/child>, but grew into a muscular and healthy frame, much to the relief of <mf:his adoptive mothers/her adoptive fathers/their adoptive parents>. <mf:He/She/They> <personality:<mf:was/was/were> always smart, speeding through novels and history-texts with equal relish./struggled with awful dreams and fragments of impossible memories that haunted <mf:him/her/them> for a while, but was able, with love and understanding, to take <mf:his/her/their> parents’ hands, and come through it./brought a natural sense of humor to everything <mf:he/she/they> did./got big-eyed around things <mf:he/she/they> wanted, but wasn’t ungenerous when it came to passing old treasures on./carried <mf:himself/herself/themself> with an uncommon maturity, showing genuine compassion much earlier than other children./could be fiery and hard to wrangle, but it was impossible not to smile at <mf:his/her/their> blurting exuberance./had a gift of confidence and decisiveness about <mf:him/her/them>, and it caused most other kids to like <mf:him/her/them>./tended to be withdrawn from strangers, insular and shunning crowds.

Soon <mf:he was/she was/they were> training with others, and competing in tourneys, honing <mf:his/her/their> skill and body for little practical reason, aside from the fact <mf:he/she/they> enjoyed it. Loyal in <mf:his/her/their> bones, and prepared for life’s turns, <mf:he/she/they>’ll find <mf:himself/herself/themself> thrown into challenges <mf:he/she/they> never imagined, but meeting them with a courage <mf:he/she/they> feels, deep down, is fed by <mf:his resting brother/her resting sister/their resting sibling>’s love.

Even as a <mf:boy, he/girl, she/child, they> worked wherever folks could find a gentle use for <mf:his/her/their> labor. Bottles absorbed whatever charity came their way. It was several old militia<mystic.mf:-men/-women/-folks> who first gave <mf:him/her/them> the idea of becoming a fighter. They were who <mf:he’d/she’d/<firstName>’d> worked beside <mf:his/her/their> whole life. They started holding little impromptu sparring matches for boneslim stakes, and <firstName> showed promise, even while <mf:he was/she was/they were> still growing into <mf:his/her/their> body. After a couple years, <mf:he/she/they> started fighting in tourneys, and, adding prize money to <mf:his/her/their> working wages, was able to move out of <mf:his/her/their> soon-to-be-estranged <mystic.awm:mom/dad>’s house. A journey to distant places always seemed to be just on the horizon for <firstName>. Just after this harvest's pay, or the next.

As fast as <mf:he/she/they> could./Moody and silly as a <mf:boy/girl/child>, <mf:he/she/they> started breaking rules and dragging <mf:his/her/their> feet. <mf:He/She/They> argued instructions, scrapped with other kids, and wept about <mf:his/her/their> <bookish.mf:brother/sister/sibling>'s callousness. <mf:He/She/They> nursed the expectation that <bookish> would up and leave, one day, and was always happy to be proved wrong and foolish./<mf:He/She/They> tried to grow up as quickly as possible, to take on more and more, and <mf:he/she/they> found that effort rewarding and empowering, though it made <mf:him/her/them> stand apart.

Not out of a desire to make <bookish.mf:him/her/them> unhappy, but maybe just... out of a desire to maintain distance from whatever else <mf:he was/she was/they were> doomed to lose.> Privately, <mf:he/she/they> would forever keep track of a parallel existence.

When Thrixl filtered into the wilderness, and began wreaking ruin, <mf:he/she/<firstName>> joined up with three desperate travelers, heroes of the looming struggle, and so began the next adventure of <mf:his/her/their> life...
villain_ecthis_Elsee_anecdote=Still children, the two of them were abducted by Thrixl, who descended on their hometown and dragged all the young off to await doom in a dark and squalid pit. Elsee's sister promised her that Elsee would make it out, and she did...! But Eluna was lost. Like the girls' parents. Lost somewhere Elsee couldn't see, or go, or help.
villain_ecthis_Elsee_motivation=Surviving those who'd loved her had never been her choice. In the years that followed, she trained herself. She would fight to take her life back from circumstance, even if it meant facing the Thrixl-warped remnant of her sister.
villain_ecthis_Elsee_origin=When Elsee was four, she and her elder sister were left in the care of <town> tradesfolk for a Spring; storms had caused havoc along the coast, and her parents traveled there to provide aid and clothing to the dispossessed. They never returned. Elsee's older sister, Eluna, took it hard, but raised Elsee as well as she could.

Often the target of others’ teasing, <mf:he/she/they> grew guarded and resentful. When a fellow came through town, calling himself a priest, and spoke of the new family he’d found among his devout brothers and sisters, <firstName> gravitated to the message. <mf:He/She/They> ran away to join their underground cult. <mf:He/She/They> quickly grew disturbed, fearful of the teachings being driven into <mf:his/her/their> ears, <mf:his/her/their> heart.

Close, but not connected. Not yet. For a whole year, <mf:he/she/they> would come into the house in the early hours of morning with a frustrated but still-wondering look in <mf:his/her/their> eyes. Then, one night, <mf:he/she/they> did it: as the mages in stories do, <mf:he/she/they> mingled with the briar and it moved with <mf:his/her/their> own feeling, and <mf:he/she/they> almost felt <mf:he/she/they> spoke to it and <mf:was/was/were> flooded with its planty reply.

But when the morning came, and five set forth for the culminating battle of their times… <fullname> found <mf:himself/herself/themself> sitting on a low stone wall, not going. <mf:He/She/They> just wasn’t quite seasoned enough. The enemy was strong, the company of heroes who had left were all powerful and well-outfitted. And thus, the adventure of <mf:his/her/their> lifetime had come.

Legends go many ways, though, and for many reasons. Perhaps all of them contain a little truth.

What <mf:he/she/they> didn’t do was dismember the living–until one particularly sadistic rival, known to experiment on live animals, laid hold of <firstName>’s dog. What followed, then, is only ever described in the haziest of terms. <firstName> served a sentence of five years. <mf:His/Her/Their> brilliance brought <mf:him/her/them> to teach at a university, some time later, though <mf:his/her/their> past meant the title of Professor, which <mf:he/she/they> apparently coveted, would never be officially bestowed on <mf:him/her/them>. As and after Pethozya crumbled at the hands of its own creations, <fullname> was willing to do what <mf:he/she/they> might to preserve whoever and whatever good remained in the ruined waste of <mf:his/her/their> homeland. That included volunteering to aid and tutor an intriguing young <npc3.mf:man/woman/person> who’d sworn vengeance on the worst of the Deathless. This <npc3.mf:boy/girl/kid> might prove useful if <npc3.mf:he/she/they> could be honed into a weapon capable of destroying the unstoppable terror known as Leegan.
villain_glyffrix_daicleedPart2=It’s written that, with the fall of Leegan the Liverthief--and varying stories drape that deed over varying shoulders--the young <npc.mf:man's/woman's/one's> vengeance was satisfied. <firstName> found <mf:himself/herself/themself> in the company of a listless and purposeless <npc>--now a very deadly assassin in <npc.mf:his/her/their> own right--and so <firstName> [i]did[] put <npc.mf:him/her/them> to work. The two of them went on a great many hunts thereafter, before their eventual and unspecific demise.
villain_glyffrix_finalDaicleedEnding=The strange thing is that some say <firstName> lives again somehow.

In all <mf:his/her/their> years after <firstName> would remember that woman fondly, and some say <mf:he/she/they> didn't die when <mf:he/she/they> grew old, but rather went back to that place to find <mf:his/her/their> love again.
villain_glyffrix_finalHeroEndingD=Instead, <firstName> was called on a grand and magical journey none expected. To Netherflare, <mf:he/she/they> went, to dance at a dragon's ball. <mf:He/She/They> met a Lostling there, and encountered heroes from some stories past and some that never were.

villain_glyffrix_finalKaylemEnding=Most stories agree that <firstName> spends <mf:his/her/their> old age collecting and archiving as much Kyoren learning and art as <mf:he/she/they> can.

villain_glyffrix_finalOnyaEnding=Despite the many pains of <mf:his/her/their> life, stories go that <mf:he/she/they> found peace in <mf:his/her/their> old age, pursuing humble arts in remote places. However, one tale has it that <fullname> doesn’t simply die: <mf:he lives/she lives/they live> again in the depths of Nitherfaruwen. And if [i]that[] story is true, then a hundred others--about the Quiet Knight of Kyor--might indeed be possible. 
villain_glyffrix_finalRayvisEnding=However, some say <fullname> lives again somehow, brought back in the depths of Nitherfaruwen. And if that story has any truth to it, then the hundred other tales of <firstName> might indeed be possible.
villain_glyffrix_kaylemHistory=<mf:He/She/They> was born the royal cousin of Queen Soogen, last ruler of Kyor, and so <firstName> grew up pampered and well-educated, in the final golden moments of Kyoren civilization. Like many of the period, <mf:he/she/they> was a deeply pious young <mf:man/woman/person>, and sanctified a limb of <mf:his/her/their> body in covenant with the god Hada-Rohana: <firstName> received Hada's holy working upon <mf:his/her/their> arm, which was both a symbol of religious devotion and a highly fashionable custom among Kyoren nobility.
villain_glyffrix_kaylemPart2=In the fall of the Kyoren capitol of Calmcourt--and it would've sounded unlikely if you'd known <mf:him/her/them>--the young courtly cousin is said to have bravely fought at the side of Captain <npc2.fullname>. The old knight, at the last, bid <firstName> flee, <npc2.mf:himself/herself/themself> staying behind to fight and die blocking the way; <firstName> carried on running, then, for a long while, but was there to bear witness to the sealing of Kyor's terrible enemy, at the price of its last great Queen. Then <mf:he was/she was/they were> taken away, and given the rest of <mf:his/her/their> life's work by the Sorceress Azdyurmayn, whose own legends remain quite obscure. <mf:He/She/They> lived almost like an exile, roving and laboring in the shattered and wildturning lands of <mf:his/her/their> youth for the rest of <mf:his/her/their> years.
villain_glyffrix_onyaHistory=A Knight of Old Kyor, <firstName> was born in a rural mountain village, enduring hardships there that left <mf:his/her/their> face scarred. <mf:He/She/They> traveled alone to the city, still in <mf:his/her/their> early youth, and was scouted for the Kyoren military. Excelling as a warrior and earning a knighthood, <mf:he/she/they> gained notoriety and commendations aplenty. However, <mf:he/she/they> veered away from a career in command to take on the duties of a royal guard<mf:sman/swoman/> to Queen Soogen, whom <mf:he/she/they> greatly admired and believed in. 
villain_glyffrix_onyaPart2=In the fall of the Kyoren capitol of Calmcourt, Captain <firstName> is said to have battled the great enemy of <mf:his/her/their> people. Below the city, <mf:he/she/they> forced the beast to falter, faithfully guarding <mf:his/her/their> Queen's retreat. But in that momentary triumph, <mf:he/she/they> could only watch as <mf:his/her/their> last remaining charge--<npc.firstName>, the royal cousin--was bespelled and called away into the crawling darkness, into webbed obscurity, never to return. <firstName> escaped that place. And went on to live with the ghosts of all <mf:he’d/she’d/they’d> ever hoped to protect.  
villain_glyffrix_rayvisHistory=A young vengeance-seeker hailing from the degraded crumbs of once-grand Pethozya, <firstName> earned a name in the haunted hills of <mf:his/her/their> homeland, and might’ve made a good life, even in the empire’s twilight. But <mf:he/she/they> would live for nothing but killing <mf:his brother’s/her sister’s/their brother’s> murderer. <mf:He/She/They> eventually pursued Leegan the Liverthief to his undermountain hiding place in the remote clifflands of the West, where the deathless assassin would be forced to face <mf:him/her/them>.
villain_glyffrix_rayvisPart2=With the fall of Leegan, and vengeance done, <fullname> found <mf:himself/herself/themself> barren of purpose. But stories abound, anyway, of the ferocious deeds <mf:he/she/they> did after: it was an old <npc.mf:man/woman/professor> who always urged <mf:him/her/them> along, so it’s said: together they went on hunting the Morthagi and the Deathless both, until their eventual and unspecific demise.
villain_glyffrix_2_4_arahar=<fullname> was a great chieftain of the Elns, alive in the time of dragons. <mf:He does/She does/They do> not live past <mf:his/her/their> mighty youth, and yet poems of <mf:his/her/their> prowess and nobility survive far longer than the last Elnish sail. The legend goes that <mf:he/she/they> cursed <mf:his/her/their> own people as <mf:he/she/they> died, for they betrayed <mf:his/her/their> courage with their cowardice. Not long after <mf:his/her/their> fall, the Elnish crown was buried in the cinders of Ooneth--the city that would come to be named Weldwall--and the sharded fleet of that seafaring civilization disappeared on the foam.
