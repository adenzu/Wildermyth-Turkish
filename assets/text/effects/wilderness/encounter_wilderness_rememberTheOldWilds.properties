~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=At <overlandTile>, clouds roll heavy as galleys.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_poet=I remember.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_poet=Do you remember, <romantic>?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_romantic=Do I what? Remember?
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_romantic=I guess I do.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_romantic=<romantic.awm:She was a carefree and garrulous shopgirl/He was a cooper's son with wanton lips, he lived> in <Town>. <romantic.bookish.60:Had a whole shelf full of that guttural Thnaric poetry/Never got tired of rooftops and singing>...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_poet=No. I'm talking about how the world used to be. When we could walk unafraid.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_poet=Roam free, alive, innocent to the beauty of the wilderness. No devils lurked in thickets. None came crawling up the rills.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_romantic=Oh, you're asking if I remember the old wilds?
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_poet=That's it, I suppose. The old wilds. Are they forever gone?
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_romantic=<romantic.goofball/poet:I don't know.Nature's always been a little bit of a bastard, right? Think about a scorpion. A mosquito. Walking into a spiderweb./Sure, I think about it sometimes. How every time we leave our homes, it might be the last time. I remember when it wasn't that way.>
~03~choice_wary~panel_001~1_hook=<romantic.goofball/poet:<romantic.mf:He's/She's/They're> right. Floods and bears and lightning/The old wilds were just as perilous.>
~04~choice_wistful~panel_001~1_hook2=So it falls to us who remember. To fix it.
~05~player_chose_humble.test_pass~panel_001~1_narration=A cool nostalgia washes over the company. The clouds sail unchallenged through the whole day.
~06~player_chose_humble.test_fail~panel_001~1_narration=Despondence settles and weighs over everyone. It's as if the clouds have become real ships. They've fallen on your shoulders to carry.
~07~player_chose_wary.test_pass~panel_001~1_hook=It would be nice to say that the world on its own is a good place, a welcoming place. Without the monsters, the wars, all the rest. But that's never been true.
~07~player_chose_wary.test_pass~panel_003~1_hook=You know why?
~07~player_chose_wary.test_pass~panel_004~1_hook=Hunger. Hunger drives every beast and flower. Strife and loss stem from that.
~07~player_chose_wary.test_pass~panel_005~1_hook=Don't think too deeply of what was or what could be, <poet>. <hook.greedy/leader:Today is what matters/We're counting on you>. Be here with us.
~09~player_chose_wistful~panel_001~1_hook2=The <hook.bookish/poet:powerful,beautiful> thing about memories is that they stretch, they link. They run between present and past like ropes.
~09~player_chose_wistful~panel_003~1_hook2=We can use them to pull ourselves back into dreams and shadow...
~09~player_chose_wistful~panel_004~1_hook2=...or we can use them to pull our dreams with us, to bring what we loved or lost into the future.
~09~player_chose_wistful~panel_005~1_hook2=<hook2.healer/loner/snark:We have the chance to make this world good, once more. Let's seize it/We don't have to do it all together, but we can each do our part to bring goodness back into the land/You know I'm not one to go over the moon for anything. So listen to me: we will bring back the world we love>.
