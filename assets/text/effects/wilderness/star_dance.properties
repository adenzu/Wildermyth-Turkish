~01~prompt~panel_001~1_poet=We've been walking for hours! The light has faded to dusk!
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_coward=I think we're going in circles! I swear I've seen that tree before. I'm not sure I like this ...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_coward=Did you hear that?!
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_goofball=That was just you, stepping on a twig.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_coward=I ... guess that's what it was.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_goofball=Come on, let's go this way. Try to watch your step, Twig Stomper.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=Suddenly, the path widens, spilling out into a large clearing, bathed in starlight.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_poet=This music ... it calls to me! We should[i] join []them!
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_coward=Join them? That seems like a profoundly bad idea! They have no faces!
~02~choice_three~panel_001~1_poet=Let us dance among the stones!
~02~choice_three~panel_001~2_darken=<poet.eventRoll:roll_three|difficulty_three>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_coward=They were all probably travelers just like us once! And now they're trapped! Dancing eternally among these rocks!
~04~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_poet=My feet take me away from where my heart would lead ...
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_001~1_poet=Come on!
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_001~2_goofball=I've got two left feet. I'm better as an audience member.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_002~1_bookish=As soon as <poet> steps between the stones, music washes over <poet.mf:him/her/them>.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_003~1_bookish=Unlike anything <poet.mf:he's/she's/they've> ever heard before, and yet, its melodies seem familiar. Were not these drums always beating in time with <poet.mf:his/her/their> heart?
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_004~1_poet=Had <poet.mf:he/she/they> not always found <poet.mf:himself/herself/themself> absently humming this tune?
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_005~1_narration=<poet.mf:He/She/<poet>> flows among them, a beam of starlight woven with the others...
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_006~1_bookish=There is a moment ...
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_006~2_narration=... when the whirling comes to a nearly frenzied pace, when the dancers are spinning, and spinning, orbiting, and nearly carried away!
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_007~1_poet=Around <poet.mf:him/her/them>, the specters cry out in adulation! <poet> hears <poet.mf:his/her/their> own voice joining them!
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_008~1_narration=With a crashing crescendo, the music falls suddenly silent. A voice, like water trickling over stones, speaks.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_008~2_poet=[blue][large] "You honor me well, <poet>."
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_009~1_poet=<poet.mf:He stands/She stands/They stand> silent, humbled and awed.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_010~1_narration=At <poet.mf:his/her/their> feet, something blue glimmers. A small book, worn with age. For a moment, the constellations on its cover sparkle, then it lies quiet and still. Waiting.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_011~1_coward=<Poet>! You're back!
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_011~2_narration=Finally, <poet> emerges from the stone circle.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_012~1_poet=I'm sorry I was gone for so long, but that was amazing!
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_014~1_goofball=You were gone for like ten seconds. You just walked into the circle, shouted some unintelligible words and then came back out.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_015~1_poet=But the specters!
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_015~2_goofball=Vanished right after you went near them.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_016~1_poet=But ... Look! I was... given this book!
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_017~1_goofball=What do the symbols mean?
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_018~1_poet=I have no idea! But I know I've seen them before!
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_019~1_coward=Can we just get out of here before anymore faceless dancing creatures reappear?
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_020~1_poet=So I go, but part of my soul will always be here.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_001~1_narration=As soon as <poet> steps between the stones, music washes over <poet.mf:him/her/them>.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_002~1_bookish=Unlike anything <poet.mf:he's/she's/they've> ever heard before, and yet, its melodies seem familiar. Were not these drums always beating in time with <poet.mf:his/her/their> heart?
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_003~1_npc=<poet.mf:He/She/<poet>> tries to join the ethereal creatures in their dance, but <poet.mf:his/her/their> feet stumble.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_004~1_poet=The music! It's fading!
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~1_poet=The specters ... they've gone also.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_006~1_narration=Dejected, <poet> emerges from the stone circle.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_006~2_coward=<Poet>! What happened to you?
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_007~1_poet=What the -- How long was I gone for?!
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_007~2_coward=Only a few minutes.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_008~1_poet=There was music, but ...
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_008~2_goofball=I'm so happy I didn't follow <poet.mf:him/her/them> into that circle.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_009~1_poet=I feel like I have failed some trial ...
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_009~2_coward=Come on, we should get out of here before anything else weird happens!
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_010~1_poet=Ever after, <poet> would catch <poet.mf:himself/herself/themself> humming a tune that <poet.mf:he/she/they> could never quite remember the entirety of.
