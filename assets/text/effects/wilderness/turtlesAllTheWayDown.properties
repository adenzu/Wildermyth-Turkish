~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=The day is calm.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=The scouting mission has discovered nothing dangerous.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_volunteer=Having outdistanced <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> companions, <volunteer> sits to rest.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_volunteer=<volunteer.mf:Does he/Does she/Do they> sleep? Dream? Is it a vision? A metaphor?
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_volunteer=Or does a tortoise truly come and speak to <volunteer.mf:him/her/them>?
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_volunteer=<volunteer.mf:He has/She has/They have> seen somewhere before the patterns that swirl upon its shell.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_volunteer=Of course you have. This pattern is everywhere.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_narration=In the wind. In the stars.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_narration=In the sea. In the storm.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_narration=In the fire and the fern.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_volunteer=We have always been here.
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_volunteer=We?
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_volunteer=We hold up the earth. And the sky. And the storm. We protect the fern and the water and the wheat.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_ship=You should understand that. You protect others also.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_ship=You're one of us. Can't you feel it?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_volunteer=<volunteer.loner/healer/leader/poet/greedy/60:This is it. This is where I can belong./ This is how I can keep them all safe. / This is it. This is how I can keep them all safe. / One with earth and wind and water...a guardian...of course I am. / This is what I've been waiting for my whole life. / This is it. This is how I can protect the Yondering Lands. >
~03~choice_three~panel_001~1_volunteer=<volunteer.loner/goofball/coward/greedy/60: Sorry, Turtle, I'm just not a joiner. / Okay, this is just too crazy. Sorry, Turtle, I need to wake up now. / No, Turtle. I'm not up for that responsibility. /No, Turtle, I'm not up for that responsibility./ Sorry, Turtle, this isn't for me.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_volunteer=Are you sure I'm the one you want?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_ship=Your choices throughout your lifetime have fitted you for this task.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_ship=You were not born a guardian, but you have molded yourself into one, moment by moment, day by day.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_ship=You are worthy to join the fellowship I speak for. Do you accept?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_volunteer=Yes. Absolutely.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_volunteer=...what happens now?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_ship=While you live? Nothing. Continue as you have been.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_ship=After your death, we will discuss this matter further.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_009~1_volunteer=Do I...become a tortoise?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_010~1_ship=The precise form is open for negotiation.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_011~1_volunteer=That almost makes it sound as though you guardians are...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_012~1_volunteer=...all around.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_013~1_speech=Throughout the world.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_014~1_speech=Everywhere.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_015~1_ship=It does, doesn't it?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_016~1_ship=Be well, <volunteer>. We will speak again one day.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_017~1_ship=Hey, <volunteer>! You been napping on the job?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_018~1_volunteer=No, I... Did you see a...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_019~1_ship=That's a pretty cool tortoiseshell pendant. Did you just find it here?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_020~1_volunteer=<volunteer.rfln.ship: I... yeah. I just found it here./ No, it's...kind of a long story. Someday I'll tell you. / No, it's... kind of a long story. I'll tell you later. Tonight. When we're alone. / I... yeah. I just found it here.>
~05~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_volunteer=Tortoise.
~05~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_volunteer=<volunteer.goofball/60: Whatever. /Sorry.>
~05~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_volunteer=<volunteer.loner/goofball/60:  Very well, <volunteer>. The choice is yours. And the lone wolf can still serve. / You're right, it's time you woke up. / Very well, <volunteer>. The choice is yours.>
~05~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_ship=Hey, <volunteer>! You been napping on the job?
~05~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_volunteer=No, I... Did you see a...
~05~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_volunteer=Yeah, I guess I must have been. Took you long enough to catch up.
~05~player_chose_three~panel_006~2_ship=Everybody's here now. Let's go.
