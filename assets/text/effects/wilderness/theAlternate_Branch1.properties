~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hero=Okay, then... <hero> of <hero.homeTown>. Let's take this nice and easy, huh?
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hero=See... I'm putting my weapons away..
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_npc=[b][i]Your[][] weapons? But... those are [b][i]my[][] weapons. How did you get my weapons?
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hero=They’re… [b][i]our[][] weapons, I suppose. You [b][i]are[][] me. Or I’m you. Maybe both.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hero=We don't just [b][i]look[][] the same--we have the same memories. <hero.historyTag_orphan.1:I remember my parents died./<hero.historyTag_adopted.1:I remember being adopted./<hero.historyTag_parents.1:I remember my parents, too./I remember the same childhood.>>> <hero.historyTag_siblings.1: The same siblings,/<hero.historyTag_nomadic.1: Always moving around,/<hero.historyTag_silverspoon.1: Having money,/<hero.historyTag_criminal.1: Getting in trouble,/ Breaking my leg,>>>><hero.historyTag_competent.1: the fishing pole.../<hero.historyTag_intellectual.1: the book of facts.../<hero.historyTag_artistic.1: the little paint set.../<hero.historyTag_confident.1: the magic pebble.../<hero.historyTag_phobia.1: the toy dragon.../ the blue blanket-->>>>>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_npc=I knew an old soldier once. Crazy, with a wooden leg. What was his name?
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_hero=Old Trya? Ha! [b][i]Her[][] name was Old Trya. Nice try, but I don’t think you can trick [b][i]me[][].
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hero=You have my memories... you know my thoughts... it's like there are [b][i]TWO[][] of me!
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hero=If you're [b][i]me[][], then maybe we can talk this out.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hero=I need to get away from this thing. Now!
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_hero=I need to [b][i]destroy[][] it...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_hero=Okay, <hero> of <hero.homeTown>. Let's be friends.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_npc=Heh! I guess that shouldn't surprise me!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~2_hero=My thoughts exactly!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_npc=I don't know. I'm not sure we can both go back to the others...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_hero=So... now that there's two of us, what do we [b][i]do[][] about it?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_npc=<hero.rfln.volunteer:\nHa! And can you imagine <volunteer>? <volunteer.mf:He/She/They> would go completely nuts if there were [b][i]two[][] of us!/\n<hero.rfln.volunteer2:\nHa! And can you imagine <volunteer2>? <volunteer2.mf:He/She/They> would go completely nuts if there were [b][i]two[][] of us!/\n<hero.rfln.volunteer3:\nHa! And can you imagine <volunteer3>? <volunteer3.mf:He/She/They> would go completely nuts if there were [b][i]two[][] of us!/\nTo say the least.../\n<volunteer3.romantic/50:\nHeh. <volunteer3> might enjoy it, but I don't think it would go over as well with the others.../\nYeah. <volunteer3> in [b][i]particular[][] might find it awkward...>/\nTo say the least...>/\n<volunteer2.romantic/50:\nHeh. <volunteer2> might enjoy it, but I don't think it would go over as well with the others.../\nYeah. <volunteer2> in [b][i]particular[][] might find it awkward...>/\nTo say the least...>/\n<volunteer.romantic/50:\nHeh. <volunteer> might enjoy it, but I don't think it would go over as well with the others.../\nYeah. <Volunteer> in [b][i]particular[][] might find it awkward...>/\nTo say the least...>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~2_hero=Good point. That might get a little confusing...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_hero=Hmmmmmmmmmm...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_hero=Y'know what I [b][i]have[][] secretly always wanted to do...?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_npc=Of course I do! <hero.bookish/coward/healer/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/80:Enter academia. Find a library or university or sacred Hall of Learning to immerse myself in!/Go back home, lay down my arms, and return to the life I had before.../Start a sanctuary, a place of healing and succor for the sick, the injured, and the displaced.../Build an Academy, a training ground where I can prepare others to join our cause!/Join a monastary. Take a vow of silence and live a quiet, peaceful life.../Take every ounce of gold I've saved, buy a villa by the sea, and live in pampered luxury 'til I die! /Retire and compose an epic--a definitive chronicle of our adventures in the Yondering Lands!/Go back to <hero.homeTown> and see if Aryl will take me back. <hero.awm:She/He> always was the one that got away.../Start a second adventuring team to protect the Yondering Lands. There's so much more to be done...>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_npc=...but I can't leave the company. I'm [b][i]needed[][] here.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_009~1_npc=--while the other <hero.bookish/coward/healer/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/80:can study to <hero.mf:his/her/their> heart's content!/can go home again!/dedicates <hero.mf:himself/herself/themself> to helping those in need!/starts that Academy!/joins the monastary!/can retire in style!/can write our story!/can take that second chance with Aryl!/starts a [b][i]new[][] group!>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_009~2_hero=But with two of us, one could stay with the group--
~05~player_chose_one~panel_010~1_hero=It's perfect!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_011~1_hero=But... who does which?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_013~1_npc=Draw lots?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_014~1_hero=And so...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_014~2_volunteer=There you are, <hero>. We were getting worried.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_014~3_volunteer2=Yeah. We thought you might have gotten lost.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_015~1_hero=Quite the contrary...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_016~1_hero=...I think you could say I found myself.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_npc=Stay back! You get away from me!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_hero=But... we're the same. You have nothing to fear from [b][i]me[][]!|
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hero=No! Wait! Please!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_npc=GET AWAY!!!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_hero=Let me help...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_hero=Later...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_volunteer=There you are, <hero>. We were worried!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~3_volunteer2=Are you all right? You look shaken!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_hero=I met something... in the woods...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_hero=It looked just like me, it knew what I knew... it thought it [b][i]was[][] me!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_hero=It was so scared and confused... it ran away.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_volunteer=It must have been some kind of changeling creature.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_009~2_volunteer2=Now that it's gone, it will most likely revert back to its natural state...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_volunteer=...unless it doesn't. In which case, I guess there'd be another [b][i]you[][] wandering the world...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_011~2_volunteer2=Ha! Can you imagine? That'd be weird, right?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_hero=Sorry, pal. There's only room for [b][i]one[][] <hero> in this world, and <hero.mf:I'm him/I'm her/that's me>.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_npc=You're confused. [b][i]I'm[][] the original. Me! Not you!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~2_hero=Wait! You don't have to do this. Sure, I thought about it too, but only for a moment. And I made a different choice. So can [b][i]you[][].
~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_npc=MY weapons. You stole my weapons... my memories... my [b][i]face[][]!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~2_hero=Don't do this. Please. You're unarmed, I have our weapons--
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_npc=[b][i]THIEF![][]
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_hero=[b][i]NO--[][]
~07~player_chose_three~panel_007~1_darken=URRKK--
~07~player_chose_three~panel_009~1_hero=Why... you didn't have to make that choice...
~07~player_chose_three~panel_009~2_speech=Why...?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_010~1_hero=And so...
~07~player_chose_three~panel_010~2_volunteer=There you are, <hero>. We were getting worried.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_010~3_volunteer2=Yeah. We thought you might have gotten lost.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_011~1_hero=...maybe I did..
