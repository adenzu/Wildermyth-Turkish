~01~prompt~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.loner/snark/60:[face:neutral]What're you doing? It's locked?/[face:skeptical]Place looks pretty run down./Place's seen better days, hasn't it?>
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_greedy=<leader.loner/snark/60:Weirdly, yeah./Locked up, though. Surprisingly sturdy./Door's locked. Real sturdy, too.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_npc=<leader.themePiece_fire_leftArm/themePiece_crow_head:Not here to burn it down, are you?/Heyo, crowmaster. Want to roost in our windmill?/\nYou folks trying to get in the windmill?>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_leader=<leader.themePiece_fire_leftArm/themePiece_crow_head:Not intentionally.[face:happy]/Not the comfiest roost I've ever spied./<leader.coward/greedy/healer/loner/60:Yes, <npc.mf: sir/ma'am>. Hoping to maybe fix up the place. If that's all right with you of course./Yep, we were hoping to fix this place up and maybe get some use out of it./Not really, just curious to see an abandoned mill out here./Eh, we were just passing by and saw this rundown place. Seemed deserted and comfy./Eh, just taking a look.>>
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_npc=<leader.themePiece_fire_leftArm/themePiece_crow_head:Heh, fair enough. /Can't say I'd pick it over a nice tree, myself. />I'd love to see it up and running again, you know. That mill used to serve all of us here in <overlandTile>.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_npc=Come whispering winter or blistering summer, it'd be spinning. Some say spirits helped the owners keep it running, though I'd place my bets on hard work. People are so quick to give credit to the unknown.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_snark=<snark.LEADER/GREEDY/ROMANTIC/LONER/60:Hard work often goes unremarked./Well, it's not spinning now.[face:skeptical]/Place looks closer to a bandit hideout \nthan a working mill.[face:skeptical]/Sounds like a quiet life. Keeping a mill.[face:neutral]./If there [i]were[] spirits that cared about it... \nseems they're not around anymore.[face:interested]>
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_npc=<snark.LEADER/GREEDY/ROMANTIC/LONER/60:By those unfamiliar with it, maybe.[face:joy]/Hey now, this old mill has seen battles by the dozen, and people by the hundred. We'll see how you're looking after a few decades./Hey now, this old mill has seen battles by the dozen, and people by the hundred. We'll see how you're looking after a few decades./[face:talking]Heh. Depending on who your neighbors may be, I suppose./This old mill has seen battles by the dozen, and people by the hundred. Amazing it's still upright at all.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc=We need places like this, you know? The windmill. It's a little piece of the ones who were... to tell those that come next that they werent' first. That they're not alone.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_npc=See, some folks are lucky enough to get songs written about them. Others end up in stories.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=Most go without a headstone to mark their death. For some, places like this are the only sign they ever lived at all.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_leader=Where's the people who run the place now? Or does it belong to anyone?
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_npc=No one, now. Last ones who ran it? Who knows.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_npc=The mill's been home to half a dozen families, likely as not. And likely as not, they all met similar fates. Bandits, monsters... bad seasons. Plagues. It's hard out here.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_greedy=And my question's starting to be... <greedy.bookish/coward/60:do we waste our effort on a place that's not likely to last twelve noons past our departure?/should we be hanging around a rickety building that's obviously cursed?[face:interested]/why exactly should we sink [i]our[] efforts into it? Sounds like it's just a bad location.[face:skeptical]>
~01~prompt~panel_012~4_leader=<leader.personality: By the time I'm sixty I won't remember half of what I've read, but the reading still has purpose. Do you understand my metaphor?[face:interested][greedy.face:skeptical]/Look, if we don't try to fix it… something’ll probably come live here. Something [i]bad.[] Right?/So you think we should do nothing? Or do you want to take its place? Going to stand here, swinging your arms and grinding grain?[face:joy]/Right now, it's wasted. Little effort could maybe be worth it./Winter isn't going to be pretty around here without it. If we can help by fixing this place... I'm going to say we should./You'd rather we just left this ruin crumpled here like one of your wet boots?[face:dubious]/Nothing lasts forever. But no one here expects it to, right? Come on, when have we regretted a little extra work?[face:talking]/I... I don't know. I'm not going to make anyone do anything. I just feel like I want to see it running again. Maybe just my own little project./You don't stop waking up, just because you'll ultimately end up asleep again.[face:grim]/[face:happy]You know, I bet they'll name it for one of us. Right? That'd be kind of neat./Yeah, why do we bother to build [i]anything?[] \nIt all falls down.[face:dubious]>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_greedy=Does it have to be a windmill though? \nWhat if that's been the problem all along?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_snark=We should clear the land for something new.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_leader=Let's fix this place up. <leader.personality:The past needs to be remembered./Being forgotten sounds horrible./At least then the crows will have somewhere comfy to sleep./[bold]Someone[] should get some use out of this place./People here need to eat./I hate seeing useless broken things lying around./People here need to eat.//A shining beacon of production can feed more than the body./The past needs to be remembered./Might as well have a [bold]useful pile of rocks[bold] lying around.>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_snark=<snark.personality:Let's break it down. Time to give these tired stones a break./ Could become a haunt for bandits if we just leave it. Better to clear the land./No one but ghosts left here, let's give the living a chance./If this place was so important, it'd never have ended up like this. /Let's take it apart. /I hate seeing useless things lying around. Let's break it down./Let's break it down. Something better can take its place. /It doesn't work anymore. Let's clear it./Let's clear it out, a fresh page is what's needed./It's a ruin. No point in letting old wounds fester./It's just taking up space. Get rid of it.>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_npc=I suppose the people they saved are legacy enough.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_narration=So the <company> set to dismantling these tired stones.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_narration=When they were finished, the land was clear, and room for new stories had been made.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_npc2=<npc.mf:He's/She's/They're> right. <leader.personality:Better to fix it./If we just leave, bandits are just as likely to fill this place as spirits./Mill-rebuilding wasn't in the job description, but food is good./If we can repair this place, it could help us out later on./Places like this need to be cared for./I don't want to keep seeing an ugly stone ruin on the horizon either./Places like this need to be cared for./It's worth more standing straight than all this teetering and tottering./There's something worth keeping here./Everyone deserves the chance to be remembered./Better to not leave an ominous abandoned tower in the middle of nowhere I feel.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_snark=Maybe so, but we don't really have time to run an entire mill.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_npc=I guess it's my turn to leave a mark here then.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_narration=With the help of <company>, <npc> rebuilt and refurbished the mill. It would the aid the heroes for years to come.
