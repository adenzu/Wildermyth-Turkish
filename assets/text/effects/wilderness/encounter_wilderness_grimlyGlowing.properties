~01~prompt~panel_001~1_poet=Something about this forest speaks to me.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_snark=Let me guess. It's about mort--
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_poet=It's about mortality, I suppose.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_poet=<poet.bookish.65:The deciduous nature of our own lives/How things grow up only to wither away>.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_poet=<poet.loner/leader:The vanity of our years is in thinking we are more than time, more than the tree or flower, doomed to expire/Though we press on against the torments of time, we all break eventually, consumed by history>.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_snark=Alas! Yon sadness!
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_poet=Oh, yuck. Hey, something died over...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_poet=...here.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_snark=Stand aside, <poet>, let me look.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=The corpse used to be a small wolf, or possibly an iron fox.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_speech=Something didn't just die. Something exploded in a shower of carnage.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_snark=There's a light inside it. <snark.goofball/greedy/poet:A spooky blue stone/A glowing crystal/A luminous crystal that calls to me>.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_snark=No time to be squeamish. That thing could be a magic spellshard or something.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_poet=Nothing about this is right. Leave it be.
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_volunteer=...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_snark=<snark> bends down and pulls the shard free, cutting still-clinging sinew away with <snark.mf:his/her/their> knife.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_snark=Then <snark.mf:he/she/they> goes suddenly still, staring at nothing. A booming voice comes out of <snark.mf:him/her/them>.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_snark=[bold][large][blue]AN ANCIENT LAW IN THE FOREST SLEEPS.[]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_snark=[bold][large][blue]BEWARE YOUR GREED: GODS PLAY FOR KEEPS.[]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_snark=Did I say something?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_009~1_snark=Come on, I have to go wash this nasty thing off.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_poet=<poet> covers the dead thing with a mat of leaves, and whispers...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_poet=<poet.loner.60:We all leave this life alone/May you find peace in the beyond>.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_snark=I'm definitely not coming back for this later.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_snark=What? Fine.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_volunteer=<volunteer> moves forward without hesitation, pulls the little crystal free of its cavity.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_volunteer2=Hey!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~2_volunteer3=<volunteer>!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_volunteer=What?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_volunteer2=Well. You're just taking it? Just like that?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_volunteer=I like it. It's pretty.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_009~1_volunteer2=I guess <volunteer.mf:he likes/she likes/they like> it.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_010~1_volunteer3=Come on.
