~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hothead=What's wrong?
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_poet=I ... sense magic.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hothead=<foes.plural>?!
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_poet=Noooo. This feels more like something is ... lingering.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_poet=Come on! It's this way!
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hothead=What is it?
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_poet=It's an overgrown mess, that's what it is! Help me uncover it!
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_poet=There we go! Ahh, that's a nice, strong font. What a rush!
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_narration=Soon ...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_speech=What are you talking about? We just pulled some weeds. I don't feel anything.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_poet=It's a font of spellthread. It ...
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_poet=... it feels like someone is pouring honeyed sunlight, woven with strands of fire through my body.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_speech=Honeyed ... sunlight?
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_poet=Yes, sunlight and starshine! While at the same time, it's an [i]unfurling[] to the world around you. To the ... spirit of a place, or thing.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_speech=Objects ... have spirits?
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_poet=Well, not like, conscious ones. It's more that ... we're [i]connected []to everything. [b][i]Spellthread[][] - woven between all of reality.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_hothead=Sometimes I feel like there's an entire world that I'm missing.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_poet=That's how I feel when you talk about tactics!
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hothead=What happens when you touch it?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_poet=Or when you were describing how combat flows for you the other day.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_hothead=Oh, how I get into a sort of rhythm?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_poet=You said it's like dancing, and I can't imagine feeling that way.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_poet=Well ... I don't know! I've always sort of ... worked with the energies from afar.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_hothead=Let's find out!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_poet=WhhoooAaaa!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_hothead=Oof!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_speech=Are you okay, <hothead>?!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_hothead=I ... yes! I'm okay!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_hothead=Wow.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_hothead=Like ... honey and sunlight, and fire.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_hothead=And I feel ...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~1_poet=Connected?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~2_hothead=Yes, exactly! To everything around me.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_012~1_hothead=Or is there even a me? Am I not the same as that tree? As that --
~05~player_chose_two~panel_013~1_poet=Come on, <hothead>. We can chat about this on the road.
