~01~prompt~panel_001~1_coward=One fateful night...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_coward=Something about that rock makes me shiver...
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_coward=A tall black finger of stone angles out of the earth, points to a pale bloated moon. Its surface should shine, but the stone seems to eat all light. It looms dull and terrible.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_bookish=Witchstone, they call it: <bookish.hothead/leader/snark:dark and tall and thirsty. I've heard of these things, but only in childish stories./flinty and jealous, and ever-hungry. You'll find them sometimes, in worried places./blacker and stonier than <bookish.rfln.coward:your quaking little heart./the blackest stony stone./even my heart, dear./the blackest stony stone.>>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_bookish=It's said if you don't offer it a joyous memory, \nit will lay a curse on your back.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_snark=And if we don't keep going, it'll be <snark>'s curse instead.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hook=Sacrifice a romantic memory...
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_hook2=Sacrifice a familial memory...
~05~choice_four~panel_001~1_hook3=Sacrifice a memory of self-worth...
~06~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_coward=Aren't you frightened of the...?
~06~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_snark=Frightened? <coward>, If I sacrificed a memory to every spooky-looking rock I came across...
~06~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_snark=...I wouldn't even remember my own name by now.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_self=[small]It's <snark>. By the way.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_013~1_darken=[gold][bold][italic]<coward> is inhabited.[][][]
~07~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hook=<hook>'s recounting is not long, <hook.mf:his/her/their> recollection perfect, of the <hook.awm:girl/boy> <hook.leader/romantic:whose heart <hook.mf:he/she/they> once stole./who stole <hook.mf:his/her/their> heart.>
~07~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_hook=...I held <hook.awm:her/him> to me, cheek to cheek...
~07~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hook=Our tears mingled...
~07~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_hook=...sunset faded.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_hook=<hook.goofball/healer/romantic/snark:We were fools, kids, but.../I remember the fields below us were crowded with wild orchids and white anise./Nothing felt real, then, except us and the light./I cringe because it all sounds so terribly melodramatic, but...>
~07~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_hook=We swore that no matter what the world might take from us...
~07~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_hook=...we would remain whole and unwounded, as long as we remained together.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_hook=Wait, what was I saying?
~07~player_chose_two~panel_012~1_self=The stone is black as a hole in existence.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_012~2_self=Sated.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_hook2=<hook2>'s recounting is not long, <hook2.mf:his/her/their> recollection perfect, of the river where <hook2.mf:his/her/their> family fished...
~08~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_hook2=...on the rocks over the water...
~08~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_hook2=...yes, <coward.mf:father/mother/one> would play <coward.mf:his/her/their> flute...
~08~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_hook2=...<coward.mf:mother/father/the other> would thread our lines.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_hook2=<hook2.bookish/hothead/loner/snark:I don't think either of them knew what they were doing, actually, but.../I could never sit still long enough to get a bite, but.../Nowadays, I choose to fish alone, but then.../Of course <coward.mf:dad's/mom's/the> flute-playing scared the fish away, but...>
~08~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_hook2=I just remember feeling like nothing was better.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_007~1_hook2=Nothing was better than sitting under the sun with them and letting the day slip by...
~08~player_chose_three~panel_010~1_hook2=Did I... wait, what was I talking about?
~08~player_chose_three~panel_012~1_self=The stone is black as a hole in existence.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_012~2_self=Sated.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_001~1_hook3=<hook3>'s recounting is not long, <hook3.mf:his/her/their> recollection perfect, of the time <hook3.mf:he/she/they> cared for a sick old <legend.mf:man/woman/person>, until the <legend.mf:man/woman/person> passed on.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_002~1_hook3=...and the truth of it floored me, at first.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_003~1_hook3=A hammer blow to the heart...
~09~player_chose_four~panel_004~1_hook3=I would have to feed <legend.mf:him/her/them>, bathe <legend.mf:him/her/them>, watch <legend.mf:him/her/them> die...
~09~player_chose_four~panel_005~1_hook3=<hook3.coward/leader/greedy/snark:It's funny to think <legend.mf:he/she/they> used to scare me when I was little, and there I was.../There were times I thought I would disappear in the night. But./I suppose I understood <legend.name>, better than other people... That was <legend.mf:his/her/their> name. <legend>./Old cussheart wouldn't just die early and let me get on with my life, but.>
~09~player_chose_four~panel_006~1_hook3=I stayed to the end.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_007~1_hook3=<legend.mf:He/She/They> smiled at me, before <legend.mf:he/she/they> passed. Didn't need to say anything, because I already knew.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_010~1_hook3=Wait, what? What did I already know?
~09~player_chose_four~panel_012~1_self=The stone is black as a hole in existence.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_012~2_self=Sated.
