~01~prompt~panel_005~1_poet=<friend>...?
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_poet=<poet.bookish/goofball/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:There's plenty to be interested in, up here. Don't worry. No danger spotted./[face:joke]I really want to say something that'll spook you! But... naw. Everything's fine. Plain and wild./[face:skeptical]Hm? No reason to come down from a place like this until you want to. Uh.../[face:talking]Taking time to talk to the world is good. Don't worry about it./[face:happy]Easy. This's that kind of day: demands we take the time to admire it./[face:skeptical][i]I'm[] fine./[face:happy]It's alright. We're not in any rush.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_friend=<friend.personality:Apologies! I've been up here, gazing into space. The landforms are... just beautiful. Arresting./Don't tell me there's trouble!? I was... sorry, I was just... thinking about things./[face:happy]Whoops! I'm up here chewing clouds and you're doing the actual work, huh?/[face:talking]Did you finish your route? I was just standing. Thinking of whatever. Sorry./[face:interested]Oh! I've been up here for ages, haven't I? I'm sorry, I... Well I lost track, plain and simple./Yeah, sorry. We okay? I've been lost in thought, somehow. Just this view.../<poet>. Trust you'd be more urgent if there was trouble? Sorry, just... staring off, thinking about things./[face:neutral]Oh. Forgot where I was for a little while. No trouble, I imagine?/Did I lose myself again? Sorry. Just trawling my heart for something solid, I suppose./Drifted away. Anything wrong? Looking at the hills got me thinking of the future./I look real industrious up here, don't I? Sorry, I honestly was just... lost in thought.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_poet=<poet.whm:Those caves you saw back there were just for bears. Had that bearsmell./Nothing hidden beyond those thickets. Just a narrow little creek and some blackberries./Plum trees is all I found. A few deep rainmade runnels. Fruit was sour.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_friend=Hm.
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_poet=<poet.coward/goofball/healer/hothead/60:Uh, yeah?[face:interested]/[face:happy]Hey./[face:happy]Yes?/What?[face:neutral]/[face:skeptical]Yeah...?>
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_friend=Hey. <poet>?
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_friend=<friend.bookish/healer/hothead/snark/60:I'd be surprised if you remember the conversation, but you probably remember the night. The night we... what was the name of that storyspinner you admired?/Let me know if it's none of my... well. Remember the night we met the singer and her apprentice?/Tell me to kick the wall if I'm being nosey. But remember the night when the singer showed up? That storyteller? What was her name?/Dumb question, maybe, but... you remember the night we ran into the old singer?/[face:interested]So... do you remember that night on the road? A woman, a famous singer and storyteller...?>
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_poet=<npc> the Dreamchanter. \nI'll always remember.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_friend=Right. Her. <friend.bookish/healer/loner/poet/60:Something from that night keeps reentering my thoughts. It's when you posed the question... well. Remember what you asked me?/[face:interested]And yeah, you can absolutely choose not to answer, but... remember what you asked me?/[face:grim]I don't even remember her face. Only when you asked me... well, do you remember what you asked me?/[face:sad]You asked me a question, that night. It's kind of... well, it's be fluttering around in my head./Remember what you asked me? I'm talking about before all the... before she even entered the thing. Just when you asked...>
~01~prompt~panel_012~3_poet=[face:skeptical]
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_poet=What would [i]you[] do, <friend>? If you found your heart racing at the thought of another? Someone you stood beside through danger?
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_friend=What ended up... happening? With that?
~01~prompt~panel_014~4_poet=Oh. You [i]didn't[] forget.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_poet=Um. Nothing.
~01~prompt~panel_016~5_friend=Sorry.
~01~prompt~panel_016~6_poet=No.
~01~prompt~panel_017~5_friend=But, I...
~01~prompt~panel_017~6_poet=I just mean...
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_poet=Go ahead. What did you want to say?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~6_friend=<friend.personality:[face:interested]Irrationally,/[face:sad]Don't hate me, but.../[face:joy]You'll laugh, but.../[face:skeptical]Fine. Here it is./[face:sad]Hate to cause trouble. Um. It's just that/[face:grim]It's stupid. Uh./[face:talking]I'll tell you./Embarrassing, but,[face:grim]/[face:interested]Put simply,/[face:happy]Okay, just,/[face:skeptical]Just that> I've wished... for a while now, I guess...  you'd been talking about me.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~5_friend=Had to tell you that... \nI'll always be your friend.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~4_poet=<poet.personality:[face:dubious]Sometimes you display an astounding aptitude for missing the subtext./[face:surprised]No. No! You're making fun of me, aren't you? You [i]have[] to be, because otherwise.../[face:joy]Are you being serious right now?/[face:skeptical]And you chose to tell me [i]now[]? Don't suppose you thought of giving me a nice gift?/[face:surprised]Do you understand what you just said? Or how unfathomable it feels to me, right now?/[face:skeptical]Shut your mouth! Tell me that again!/[face:interested]Okay. This is what I was afraid of, and what I.../[face:interested]I must've been too vague./[face:interested]You're blushing like a sunset sky. You [i]mean[] it?/[face:surprised]I can't believe this. It's like something from a story...!/[face:dubious]Alright, [i]you[] may think this's funny, but...>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~5_friend=<poet.personality:[face:grim]You don't have to mock me./[face:interested]Otherwise?/[face:skeptical]Well, I.../[face:interested]Oh. Should I have?/[face:sad]Oh. Because why?/[face:skeptical]Erm, what?/[face:sad]<poet>? Sorry, it's not important./[face:skeptical]I... shouldn't have said it, right?/[face:skeptical]Well... yeah?/[face:sad]A sad story?/[face:grim]Sorry, I'm... not kidding.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~4_poet=<poet.personality:[face:skeptical]But, <friend>, /[face:happy][friend.face:interested]It's just that... /<friend>, /[face:happy]Would've been great, but... /[face:happy]Because /That's what I get for trying to be subtle!\n/No, it [i]is[]. Because /[face:talking]<friend>, I'm terrible at this. /But this is all I... /No, <friend>, [face:joke]the best story [i]ever[]. You didn't know?\n/[face:skeptical]Wait, you're [i]not[]? And you didn't [i]know[]?\n>I [i]was[] talking about you.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~5_friend=<friend.personality2:[face:happy]Every trailing thought brought me back to your name. \nI started hoping. Without reason./[face:interested]I was so scared of what you'd say. I [i]hoped[], but.../[face:happy]Thought I was a fool for hoping./Didn't care about anything else for a while... Just hoped.../Hoped and hurt in equal measure./[face:happy]I hoped and hoped until I thought my chest would explode!/I worried, you know? I hoped./You know how much I hoped...?/I wondered, I hoped./My hoping heart made sleep impossible.[face:happy]/Never had a reason to hope. Might be what made hoping so easy.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~6_poet=<poet.personality2:I couldn't let myself get distracted with hope!/I didn't [i]dare[] hope./I gave up hope! I really did!/I didn't [i]dare[] hope./I couldn't hope! It hurt!/Hope? I couldn't [i]let[] myself...!/I couldn't afford to hope!/I didn't [i]dare[] hope./Hope? I entreated gods! \nI [i]invented[] gods to entreat!/I [i]couldn't[] hope! I couldn't dare to [i]look[] at you!/I hoped, too! Kind of a first for me!>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~6_poet=<poet.bookish/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:It's the opposite of judicious. But, will you try this with me?/[face:talking]We're not going to ignore this, are we? We'll give it a try?/[face:talking]Will it be alright? Would you be okay being... us?/[face:talking]You're [i]in[], then. Right? We're doing this?/[face:grim]I'll be with you. If you want. Do you want that?/[face:skeptical]I'll be with you. If you want. Do you want that?/[face:joke]You want to ruin our friendship together?/[face:interested]You want to try and... try?>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~7_friend=I... yeah.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~5_friend=<ship.exists:Except... what about <ship>?[face:skeptical]/[face:joy]Why didn't you just tell me?>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~6_poet=<ship2.exists:[face:grim]What about <ship2>?/<ship.exists:[face:grim]<ship.mf:He's/She's/They've> been distant with me./[face:happy]What made you tell [i]me?>>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~5_friend=<ship2.exists:I'll have to tell <ship2.mf:him/her/them>. Maybe <ship2.mf:he/she/they>'ll take it alright. I don't know, I just... [face:grim]/<ship.exists:[face:interested]/[face:happy]I would've been crushed by it. If I'd just let it... just grow.>>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~6_poet=<ship.exists:[face:skeptical]<ship>... I think <ship.mf:he already knows/she already knows/they already know>./<ship2.exists:[face:sad]<ship2.mf:He's/She's/They're> going to hate me./[face:joy][i]Listen[] to you!>>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_009~4_poet=<ship2.exists:<ship.exists:Can we do this? Really?/[face:skeptical]Can we really do this?>/<ship.exists:[face:sad]But it won't be simple./[face:happy]We're really going to do this?>>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_009~5_friend=<ship2.exists:I don't think there's anything else we [i]can[] do. Now we both... know.../<ship.exists:[face:sad]<ship.mf:He/She/They>'ll take it hard, I think./[face:happy]I... yeah. We really are.>>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_013~1_narration=[navy]Far we go and high we climb.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_013~2_narration=[navy]The distances we walked led us here.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_013~3_narration=[navy]Together.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~7_friend=<friend.goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/snark/80:<ship.exists:[face:joke]And... if you ever want me to test [i]<ship>'s[] loyalty.../[face:joy]And... I wish you'd do something crazy. I'm bored of the same old campfire talk!>/No matter what, I'd be there for you. Regardless./[face:joke]I might rough you up a bit, but I'll support you. In anything./I care about the whole team, of course. But you've also got to live you're life, and I'll stand by you./[face:neutral]Being serious, you're one of the few people I'd die for. Don't really say it much, but it's true./[face:joke]Even if you mess things up, I've got your back. Unless it gets, like... [i]really[] bad./[face:happy]I'm on your side. However you choose to live your life, I'm going to support you.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~6_friend=<friend.loner.60:[face:neutral]/[face:happy]>That's all, I guess. What were [i]you[] going to say?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~7_poet=[face:interested]Me, I...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~7_poet=Same thing, basically. <ship.exists:Or, uh, just that <ship> and I... That moment's... behind me. And/I'm not going to do anything that'll be... Anyway,> I'm so glad I'll get to call you my friend. For a long time.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~5_friend=<friend.goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/snark/80:[face:dubious]/[face:interested]/[face:joy]/[face:happy]/[face:interested]/[face:happy]/[face:happy]>Seems like however far we go, and however high we climb, we never get too lost, do we?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~6_poet=<poet.loner/snark/60:[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]/[face:neutral]>Hmm. Yep.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~5_friend=Come on, then. We've got beds at the other end of that road. <friend.personality2:Can't wait to get under a roof. Maybe a library./[face:interested]If we're lucky, it won't rain on us. And we won't get ambushed./I'll go say goodbye to that foxy we saw.../[face:joke]Expect we'll get welcomed home with coins and kisses./You can rest your feet, eat your fill, and warm your spirits./[face:joke]<season> beer's probably rolling in. Looking forward to wrestling away more than my share./[face:talking]Plenty of firelight to talk by. Let's not let our guard down before the journey's done./[face:neutral]Which... isn't wholly appealing. But I'm at least looking forward to some fresh baked pie./[face:happy]There's a fox been wandering around who I'd like to get a closer look at. Feels like my kin, somehow./[face:happy]I'm thinking warm bread, warm blankets, and warm company./[face:joke]At least if you break your neck on the way down, you've told me how you really feel!>
