~01~prompt~panel_001~2_volunteer=Thank goodness for tiny, roadside inns. Feels like it's been [b][i]weeks[][] since I slept in a nice, warm bed...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hero=<hero.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:\nAgreed. Sleeping exposed in the open--even with a watch on guard--gives me the creeps./\nWeeks? Feels like [b][i]months[][]. Sign me up./\nWe can even sleep the whole night. No need for watch rotations./\nWe sleep wherever the job takes us. That's what we signed up for./\nI don't know. I like the quiet of the open road. It's a bit crowded here for my taste./\nYou said it. I slipped the Innkeeper a few extra coins for her highest thread count sheets./\nI don't know. I find it inspiring, sleeping under the stars.../\nFeels like it's been weeks since I've had a chance to [b][i]share[][] a nice, warm bed.../\nAssuming the beds [b][i]are[][] nice. If the ale's anything to judge by, you're giving this place too much credit./\nWe can even sleep the whole night. No need for watch rotations.\n>
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_volunteer=<hero.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:\nGood point! We won't even [b][i]need[][] a watch tonight! It's like paradise./\nRight? My entire body is aching./\nRight? It's like paradise./\nMaybe you did, but tonight? I sleep in a [b][i]bed[][]./\nSure, but... beds. [b][i]BEDS.[][]/\nWhatever. I'm happy to sleep on burlap, as long as there's a mattress under it./\nI find it inspiring not getting rained on overnight. To each their own, I guess./\n<hero.loverLevel.volunteer:\nHey, don't let [b][i]me[][] keep you from anything./\nMmmm. Play your cards right and we'll see...>/\nMaybe...but I'll take what I can get./\nRight? It's like paradise.\n>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hero=<hero.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:\nI wouldn't go [b][i]that[][] far, but the ale here definitely hits the--/\nBeds [b][i]and[][] ale. What more could I ask from--/\nPlus the ale here defiinitely hits the--/\nWell, bed or not, the ale here certainly hits the--/\nTo each their own. At least the ale here definitely hits the--/\nGood, because she only had the one really nice set--/\nWell, stars or not, I'll agree the ale here hits the--/\n<hero.loverLevel.volunteer:\nSo far, you're only keeping me from another mug of ale, but--/\nHow about I get us another couple of ales and then we can-->/\nStill, after the journey we've had, bad ale is better than--/\nPlus the ale here defiinitely hits the--\n>

~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc=Wha--<hero>?
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hero=Because I didn't know.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_volunteer=That's your [b][i]<npc.mf:father/mother/parent>[][]? Why didn't you tell us <npc.mf:he/she/they> lived nearby?
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hero=What am [b][i]I[][] doing here? What are [b][i]you[][] doing here? We're miles away from <hero.hometown>.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_npc=<hero>... I haven't seen you since you left home. What are you doing here?
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc=Oh... er... your <npc.mf:mother/father/zaza> and I have... well, we had some difficulties, and... now I've settled here in <overlandTile>.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hero=You... and <npc.mf:Mom/Dad/Zaza>...
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hero=What did you do?
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_npc=Well... it's a little more complicated thanâ€”
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hero=Of course it is. It's [b][i]always[][] complicated with you.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hero=<hero.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:\nLet me guess. Things got a little tough again, so you ran away? Like you always did?/\nI don't know why I'm surprised. Any time <npc.mf:Mom/Dad/Zaza> ever tried to talk to you about anything, you'd shrug <npc.mf:her/him/them> off. You never took <npc.mf:her/him/them> seriously. How did you think that would end?/\nLet me guess. You lost your cool and snapped at <npc.mf:her/him/them> again. How bad was it? You must have really crossed a line if <npc.mf:she/he/they> didn't buy the old "honey, I didn't mean it" routine this time./\nWhat was it? <npc.mf:Mom/Dad/Zaza> finally get tired of you bossing <npc.mf:her/him/them> around all the time? Always telling <npc.mf:her/him/them> what to do and how to do it? Always having to be right?/\nWhat was it this time? Did you walk out on <npc.mf:her/him/them> again? Leaving <npc.mf:her/him/them> behind to... how did you always put it? "Discover" yourself?/\nBecause it's always about you, isn't it? Never your fault, of course, because [b][i]you're[][] always the wronged party. Ugh! I don't know how <npc.mf:Mom/Dad/Zaza> put up with you until now./\nWhat was it? Did <npc.mf:Mom/Dad/Zaza> finally get fed up and throw you out, or did you make a scene and storm out on <npc.mf:her/him/them> before <npc.mf:she/he/they> could?/\nWhat was it this time? <npc.mf:Mom/Dad/Zaza> catch you sneaking around behind <npc.mf:her/his/their> back again?/\nLet me guess. <npc.mf:Mom/Dad/Zaza> finally threw you out because <npc.mf:she was/he was/they were> sick of the endless needling? The crabbing, the fussing, the "it's not good enough"?/\nWhat was it? Did <npc.mf:Mom/Dad/Zaza> finally get fed up and throw you out, or did you make a scene and storm out on <npc.mf:her/him/them> before <npc.mf:she/he/they> could?>
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hero=Don't put this on <npc.mf:her/him/them>! When did this happen? Were you ever going to [b][i]tell[][] me about it?
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_npc=Now that's not fair! You know what your <npc.mf:mother/father/other parent> is like!
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hero=WELL MAYBE I LEFT HOME SO YOU [b][i]COULDN'T[][] FIND ME!!!
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_npc=Well it's not like I knew where to find you!
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_npc=Oh...
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_npc=I see.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_npc=<hero.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:\nWell. I guess I should turn in early tonight./\nWell... I see I'm out of ale, so I suppose I should call it a night./\nWell then. If [b][i]that's[][] the way you want it.../\nFar be it from me to talk you out of that.../\nIf you'll excuse me. It's a bit crowded in here for my taste./\nIf that's the way you feel about me.../\nWell. I guess I'll be turning in early tonight./\nIf you'll excuse me. I'm late to meet someone./\nWell. I'd say we should do this more often, but... clearly not. Good night./\nWell. I guess I'll be turning in early tonight.>
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_hero=<hero.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:\nSee? What did I say? As soon as it gets tough, <npc.mf:he runs/she runs/they run>./\n'Out of ale'. Pfff. Ale here's not even that good.../\nWhat? <npc.mf:He/She/They> deserved every word of that./\nForget this place. I say we move on and camp out tonight./\nAnd off <npc.mf:he goes/she goes/they go> again. Maybe <npc.mf:he'll/she'll/they'll> 'discover' <npc.mf:himself/herself/themself> [b][i]this[][] time./\nSee? What did I tell you? Making it all about [b][i]<npc.mf:him/her/them>.[][]/\nTypical. That is so like <npc.mf:him/her/them>--starting something <npc.mf:he refuses/she refuses/they refuse> to finish./\nLate to meet 'someone'? Wanna bet on how long [b][i]that[][] lasts?/\nWhat a [b][i]jerk[][]./\nTypical. That is so like <npc.mf:him/her/them>--starting something <npc.mf:he refuses/she refuses/they refuse> to finish.>
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_volunteer=<hero.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:\nMaybe. But <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> not the one afraid to sleep outside. Even with a watch./\nSounds a little flip for the <hero.mf:man/woman/person> accusing <hero.mf:his/her/their> <npc.mf:father/mother/parent> of not taking things seriously.../\nMaybe. But [b][i]<npc.mf:he's/she's/they're>[][] not the one who lost <npc.mf:his/her/their> cool and snapped just now./\nSays the <hero.mf:man/woman/person> who's [b][i]never[][] bossy.../\nY'know, [b][i]you[][] were just complaining it was crowded in here, too./\nSays the <hero.mf:man/woman/person> who [b][i]never[][] puts <hero.mf:his/her/their> own comfort above that of others./\nYeah, I'm not entirely sure [b][i]<npc.mf:he's/she's/they're>[][] the one who started that./\n<hero.loverLevel.volunteer:\nSays the <hero.mf:man/woman/person> who was just looking for someone to share [b][i]<hero.mf:his/her/their>[][] bed?/\nLonger than us? Don't think I haven't noticed you have a wandering eye yourself, love.>/\nScathing comeback for a <hero.mf:man/woman/person> who [b][i]never[][] needles [b][i]anyone[][].../\nYeah, I'm not entirely sure [b][i]<npc.mf:he's/she's/they're>[][] the one who started that.>
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_hero=Excuse me? What is [b][i]that[][] supposed to mean?
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_volunteer=It means... look, <npc.mf:fathers/mothers/parents> and <hero.mf:sons/daughters/kids> are complicated. And I know it's none of my business...
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_volunteer=...but it seems to me the two of you had a second chance just now, and you let it slip by. If it were me...
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_volunteer=<volunteer.historyTag_orphan.1:\n...I'd give anything for another chance with my <npc.mf:father/mother/parent>./\n<volunteer.historyTag_adopted.1:\n...I'd give anything for another chance with my <npc.mf:father/mother/parent>. My birth <npc.mf:father/mother/parent>, I mean./\n<volunteer.coward/healer/hothead/leader/60:\n...I'd be afraid there might never be a third one./\n...I'd want to mend that rift while there's still time./\n...well, I'd've probably let it slip by, too. But I'd regret it the rest of my life./\n...I'd reconsider letting it go. Second chances are hard to come by, and they seldom come again./\n...I'd ask myself very carefully if I was okay with that.>>>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hero=Whatever. I'm through with that old <npc.mf:man/bat/goat>!
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hero=...maybe... maybe I was a little harsh...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_hero=I think I'll turn in. Nice, warm beds. Right?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hero=Give me a minute, will you?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hero=<npc.mf:\nDad!/\nMom!/\nRenny!> Wait!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_hero=Look... I'm sorry. It was just... kind of a big shock.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_npc=No, you were right to be upset. I never make things easy, do I?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_hero=Well... no. You never did.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_hero=But in the time since I left home, I've done a lot of things that weren't easy...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_hero=<hero.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:\nI've stood my ground when I wanted to run from things that are, frankly, way worse than you./\nI've fought nightmares. Saved lives. Made people smile in the depths of despair. [b][i]Literally[][] one time, it was the name of this dungeon.../\nI've fought nightmares. Saved lives. Learned to harness some of that anger inside and use it to [b][i]help[][] people instead of hurt them./\nI've made hard decisions, with lives hanging in the balance--sometimes the lives of my closest friends./\nI've fought nightmares. Saved lives. Opened myself to people who [b][i]matter[][] to me. Made friends who are almost a family./\nI've slept on dirt. In the [b][i]rain[][]. Gone without food for days on end... and put myself in harm's way for the sake of protecting others./\nI've fought nightmares. Saved lives. Climbed mountains and swum oceans--both literal and metaphorical./\nI've fought nightmares. Saved lives. Survived countless heart-breaks... and [b][i]caused[][] a few I still regret./\nI've fought nightmares. Saved lives. Learned that cynicism's not always welcome... and that optimism's not always stupid./\nI've fought nightmares. Saved lives. Forged [b][i]hope[][] in a world of fear. >
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_hero=I guess if I can do all that... I should be able to manage a civil conversation with my <npc.mf:father/mother/parent>.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_npc=It all sounds so exciting. I'd like to hear about it some time.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~1_hero=I'd like to tell you...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_012~1_narration=And so, the next morning...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_012~2_hero=...so we waited there, hiding in ambush, until--<volunteer>!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_012~3_volunteer=Hey! There you are. Sorry to interrupt... but It's time to move out.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_013~1_hero=Afraid so. We've finished scouting <overlandTile>, but we need to move on.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_013~2_npc=So soon?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_014~1_hero=Don't worry, though. I'll stop by to check in next time we come through. Okay?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_014~2_npc=All right. Safe travels, <hero>...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_015~1_hero=Always. See you soon, <npc.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_017~1_npc=...I love you.
