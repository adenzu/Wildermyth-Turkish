~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:\nI know you love your books, but I thought you�d find this picture worth a thousand words.../\nI hope I didn�t alarm you. I just didn�t want you to miss this view./\nI knew you�d appreciate the little prank. I thought you�d appreciate this, too./\nYou spend so much time taking care of others, I wanted to do something special for you./\nI know how on worked up you can get. I thought you�d enjoy a nice, moment of quiet./\nIt seems like you�ve been carrying the weight of the party on your shoulders lately...I wanted to help you lighten that load./\nGiven all the hustle and bustle lately, I thought you�d appreciate a moment of peaceful quiet.../\nI know it�s not worth anything... but I thought you�d find it priceless./\nI know how much beauty moves you. The Yonderlands don�t get much more moving than this./\nI knew you'd like it. You may play the flirt, but I know you�re a romantic at heart./\nDon�t tell me you�re speechless for once. You've always got some wisecrack at hand.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hero=<lover.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:\nI don�t have the words to describe this. I�m sure you do... but I don�t./\nI thought you were running from shadows or something, but this... you always find ways to surprise me./\nThis...this is even better than the time you filled <greedy>�s bedroll with daythorn flowers�/\nYou are the most� you always know just how to lift everyone�s spirits./\nI thought you were dragging me headlong into danger or something, like usual. I never dreamed you were dragging me to this..../\nI�m glad I followed you here. I�d follow you anywhere./\nI'd've thought you'd want to enjoy a moment like this by yourself. Thank you for sharing it with me../\nThank you. For not keeping a view like this to yourself.../\nThis is so... beautiful. And sappy. And perfect. It�s just like you./\nHeh. If I didn�t know better, I�d say you were trying to seduce me./\nWow. You're actually being sincere. I didn't know you could be.... but it suits you.>
