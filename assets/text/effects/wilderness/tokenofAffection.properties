~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hero=For <lover>.
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_npc=Of course, [i]<lover>.[]
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc=Is this a <random:grandiose furs/painted silks/studded leather> <lover>? <random:A practical/A silver-loving/A colorful/A shimmer-weave> <lover>?
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_npc=There are <random:big ironbuckle/stiff collar/shiny brassbutton/bead-bedecked> <lover>-types out there, maybe <lover.mf:he’s/she’s/they’re> one of those.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hero=A <lover.hothead/greedy/snark/loner/80:tolerant/tolerant/tolerant/tolerant/patient> <lover>.

~01~prompt~panel_012~2_hero=<lover.mf:He's/She's/They're> a rare find. One I don't entirely deserve.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hero=But traveling, tracking and fighting—<company.chapterNumber.2:it takes up whole seasons now. It's worn even <lover> thin, last few weeks especially./it’s suddenly breakfast, lunch and dinner now. And <lover>'s deep in it.>
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hero=<lover.greedy/bookish/leader/snark/hothead/coward/loner/80:<lover.mf:He treks/She treks/They trek> way ahead, like <lover.mf:he’s/she’s/they’re> looking for something but won’t tell me what./Everything we talk about these days is... logistical./Everything we talk about these days is... logistical./I shouldn’t take it personally when <lover.mf:he gets/she gets/they get> snippy, I know./I shouldn’t take it personally when <lover.mf:he gets/she gets/they get> snippy, I know./<lover.mf:He thinks he’s/She thinks she’s/They think they’re> more alone than <lover.mf:he is/she is/they are>.

~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hero=So I thought if I found something... to show how I...
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_hero=You did not need to know all this.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_npc=Folks usually save it for the barkeeper. Appreciate the context, though. If you want my opinion?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_npc=A necklace is classic.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=-1 Ingot
~02~choice_one~panel_001~3_darken=[green]+Health
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_npc=Can’t go wrong with a sash.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=-1 Fabric
~03~choice_two~panel_001~3_darken=[green]+Potency
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_npc=An etched belt, perhaps?
~04~choice_three~panel_001~2_darken=-1 Hide
~04~choice_three~panel_001~3_darken=[green]+Block
~05~choice_four~panel_001~1_npc=Just tell <lover.mf:him/her/them> what you told me.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_npc=Barkeeper can give you an ale-mug. I can give you a necklace.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_hero=You think it'll help?
~06~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_npc=The rest is your goose to pluck.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_hero=<hero.goofball.60:[face:happy]Hey, it's <lover>./<lover>.>
~06~player_chose_one~panel_006~2_lover=Ah, you're back.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_lover=Listen, did <lover.hothead.60:you do something/something happen> to the tent? It won't stand, I've been yanking it around all evening.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_hero=<hero.greedy/snark/hothead/goofball/80:[face:talking]I'll buy you a new one. I know a <npc.mf:guy/lady/place>./[face:dubious]Eh, tent can go sulk on its own sticks./[face:talking]Eh, tent can go sulk on its own sticks./[face:joke]Eh, tent can go sulk on its own sticks./We'll look at it later.> I was thinking tonight, we could have a sit over on the hill, watch the stars pop.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_008~2_lover=Now?
~06~player_chose_one~panel_009~1_hero=<hero.snark/hothead/80:Tents wait, stars don't./Tents wait, stars don't./Breeze is still warm.>
~06~player_chose_one~panel_010~1_hero=[small]Plus, I got you something...
~07~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_npc=I can stitch a custom message on it.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_npc=Takes a few hours, though. And honestly, costs more than the sash itself.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hero=<hero.coward/healer/snark/hothead/60:Maybe next... sash./I'm sure it's lovely, but.../[face:dubious]May have to pass on that./[face:dubious]May have to pass on that./[face:skeptical]That's alright.>
~07~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_npc=Fair. This one's probably good enough as is.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_hero=<hero.goofball.60:[face:happy]Hey, it's <lover>./<lover>.>
~07~player_chose_two~panel_007~2_lover=Ah, you're back.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_lover=Listen, did <lover.hothead.60:you do something/something happen> to the tent? It won't stand, I've been yanking it around all evening.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_hero=<hero.greedy/snark/hothead/goofball/80:[face:talking]I'll buy you a new one.

~07~player_chose_two~panel_011~1_hero=[small]Plus, I got you something...
~08~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_npc=Ancient Thnarric verse! Protective power there.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_hero=What's it etched with?
~08~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_npc=[small]Probably.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_007~1_hero=<hero.goofball.60:[face:happy]Hey, it's <lover>./<lover>.>
~08~player_chose_three~panel_007~2_lover=Ah, you're back.

~08~player_chose_three~panel_011~1_hero=[small]Plus, I got you something...
~09~player_chose_four~panel_001~1_npc=If you can remember the words.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_002~1_npc=There were quite a few. But that bit at the end seemed like the important one.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_003~1_hero=I think I can remember. Probably need to hurry, though.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_005~1_npc=Wait!
~09~player_chose_four~panel_006~1_npc=Sure you don't <hero.whm:need a... a ham-knife/need those boots/want those runecuffs> or anything?
~09~player_chose_four~panel_008~1_npc=I've got to stop doing that.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_011~1_hero=<hero.goofball.60:[face:happy]Hey, it's <lover>./<lover>.>
~09~player_chose_four~panel_011~2_lover=Ah, you're back.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_012~1_lover=Listen, did <lover.hothead.60:you do something/something happen> to the tent? It won't stand, I've been yanking it around all evening.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_012~2_hero=<lover>.<hero.romantic/coward/leader/healer/poet:[face:happy]//[face:happy]/[face:neutral]/[face:happy]>
~09~player_chose_four~panel_013.(hero_is_romantic)~1_hero=I... was going to say, I...
~09~player_chose_four~panel_014.(hero_is_romantic)~2_hero=I'm sorry. Even when you're wrestling with a tent, you're... <lover.hothead/greedy/leader/60:stunning/stunning/stunning/just lovely>. To behold.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_015.(hero_is_romantic)~1_hero=Maybe I was going to say something about that? I honestly can't remember now.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_017.(hero_is_romantic)~1_hero=Anyway. I was thinking that, tonight, we could have a sit over on the hill. And watch the stars pop. Talk about things other than the tent. <hero.shipLevel.lover:--///Like we used to./Like we used to.>
~09~player_chose_four~panel_018.(hero_is_romantic)~1_hero=Breeze won't be warm for much longer.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_020.(hero_is_coward)~1_lover=Hm?
~09~player_chose_four~panel_021.(hero_is_coward)~1_lover=Hey. Are you okay?
~09~player_chose_four~panel_022.(hero_is_coward)~1_hero=Am [i]I[] okay?
~09~player_chose_four~panel_023.(hero_is_coward)~1_lover=You've seemed <lover.goofball/snark/80:all crinkle-browed/all out of whack/troubled. Or distracted> lately. I've been worried about you.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_023.(hero_is_coward)~2_hero=Wait. Me?
~09~player_chose_four~panel_025.(hero_is_coward)~1_hero=You know, it would be nice to spend an evening watching the stars come out. On the hill, maybe? Away from... this.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_025.(hero_is_coward)~2_lover=The <lover.goofball/snark/hothead/healer/poet/80:busted/busted/busted/stubborn/stubborn/broken> tent?
~09~player_chose_four~panel_025.(hero_is_coward)~3_hero=And everything.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_026.(hero_is_coward)~1_hero=See if we can get some time while the breeze is still warm.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_027.(hero_is_leader)~1_hero=Tell you what. Let's give the tent some time to relax. It's probably tired.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_028.(hero_is_leader)~1_lover=It probably is.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_029.(hero_is_leader)~1_hero=Maybe it's feeling a lot of pressure these days?
~09~player_chose_four~panel_030.(hero_is_leader)~1_lover=It could be.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_031.(hero_is_leader)~1_hero=And while we're giving the tent some time, [i]we[] can have a sit on the hill, watch the stars come out. I'll tell you about the market today.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_032.(hero_is_leader)~1_hero=See if we can get there while the breeze is still warm.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_033.(hero_is_healer)~1_hero=Tell you what. Let's give the tent some time to relax. It's probably tired.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_034.(hero_is_healer)~1_lover=It probably is.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_035.(hero_is_healer)~1_hero=Maybe it's feeling a lot of pressure these days?
~09~player_chose_four~panel_036.(hero_is_healer)~1_lover=It could be.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_037.(hero_is_healer)~1_hero=And while we're giving the tent some time, [i]we[] can have a sit on the hill, watch the stars come out. I'll tell you about the market today.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_038.(hero_is_healer)~1_hero=See if we can get there while the breeze is still warm.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_039.(hero_is_poet)~1_hero=Something the wild astrologers said... was that the stars are the closest we ever get... to actually [i]hearing[] light.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_040.(hero_is_poet)~1_hero=And, yeah, we can fix the tent.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_041.(hero_is_poet)~1_hero=But first, the stars'll emerge. The [i]stars.[] Will sing out their brightness. <hero.shipLevel.lover:--/And remind us of our dreams./And remind us of our dreams./And give us memories./And give us memories.>
~09~player_chose_four~panel_042.(hero_is_poet)~1_hero=I want to be there. I want [i]us[] to be there. While the breeze is still warm, I want to listen... <hero.shipLevel.lover:--/I want to dream out loud with you, tonight. I want to still do that./I want to dream out loud with you, tonight. I want to still do that./to all we can recall. Of the things that brought us here. Together./to all we can recall. Of the things that brought us here. Together.>
~09~player_chose_four~panel_043.(hero_NOT_romantic/coward/leader/healer/poet)~1_hero=This shouldn't pop.
