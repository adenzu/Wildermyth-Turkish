~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=<hero> sometimes wondered if the <hero.weaponType> made of bones was cursed.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=Not because it seemed to be, but because it would have made sense.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=<hero.snark/hothead/leader/coward/romantic/poet/greedy/80:Otherwise <hero.mf:he/she/they> had to wait for misfortune elsewhere, and that was irritating./Things being too easy made <hero> uneasy./Things being too easy made <hero> uneasy./Things being too easy made <hero> uneasy./And the itch of a gap in a good story drove <hero> crazy./And the itch of a gap in a good story drove <hero> crazy./And the itch of a gap in a good story drove <hero> crazy./<hero> needed some things that made sense.>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=But the weapon behaved—in the usual, quiet way that inanimate objects do.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_narration=Until <hero> found <hero.mf:himself/herself/themself> deep within <overlandTile>.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hero=...It’s that buzzing tension you get when you visit the site of a childhood memory.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_ship=Huh.
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_ship=<ship.goofball/snark/hothead/greedy/80:You, um, get that a lot?/You, um, get that a lot?/You, um, get that a lot?/You, um, get that a lot?/You seem to know this feeling?>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hero=<hero.pcfn.ship:[face:dubious]I've got slimy things in the trunk of my past too, you know./[face:dubious]Don’t overthink it. My childhood was fine for the most part./[fac e:interested]Don’t overthink it. My childhood was fine for the most part./[face:skeptical]You don’t?>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hero=The strange bit is, though… they're not [i]my[] memories.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_ship=Whose are they, then?
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_narration=As the nights passed...
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_narration=...the answer became clearer.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_narration=And after a number of mornings into their trek...
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hero3=There's nothing here.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hero3=No monster-sign, no recent ruin. Lots of shrugs from the locals.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_hero3=<hero3.snark/goofball/hothead/coward/loner/healer/romantic/80:[face:dubious]So unless you all want to take a few days and mooch drinks off 'em, which I’m [i]not against[].../[face:joke]So unless you all want to take a few days and mooch drinks off 'em, which I’m [i]not against[].../[face:grim]We’re wasting our time./[face:skeptical]Kinda nice for a change./[face:skeptical]Kinda nice for a change./[face:interested]Good to know there are still peaceful places./[face:interested]Good to know there are still peaceful places./[face:grim]Fortunate, but means we’re needed elsewhere.>
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_hero=Wait.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_hero=There is something.
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_hero=Think I know where, too.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_ship=What do you mean?
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_hero=<hero.hothead/coward/snark/goofball/bookish/poet/loner/80:Listen, do you trust me or not?/[face:interested]We’ll know if I’m right. I hope I’m not./[face:skeptical]If I’m right, I’ll tell you. If I’m not, I’d rather not look like a fool./[face:skeptical]If I’m right, I’ll tell you.

Or we won't./It’ll be a quick out-of-the-way. Let me put my mind at ease.>
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_narration=<hero> led them out past a tiny <overlandTile.biome> town, along a road <overlandTile.bghps:hugged by weeds/traveled mostly by grasshoppers/traveled mostly by the wind/paved mostly with pinecones/of sour-smelling mud>. As <hero.mf:he/she/they> gripped the <hero.weaponType>, its pull grew ever more insistent.
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_npc=Oh, no. No. For the sake of all that's buried, ugh!
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_npc=Where did you get [i]that?[]
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_hero3=The [i]Armored Storm?[]
~01~prompt~panel_026~2_ship=Rings a bell?
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_hero=The <hero.weaponType>.
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_npc=Thought I’d left all that "Armored Storm" baggage behind.
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_hero3=...Did you actually have those powers from the stories, or was that just flourish?
~01~prompt~panel_029~2_npc=I make a point never to listen to the stories.
~01~prompt~panel_030~1_hero3=<hero3.coward/poet/romantic/80:[face:scared]/[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:grim]>But you could become… towns feared you. You murdered—
~01~prompt~panel_031~1_npc=Executed.
~01~prompt~panel_032~1_npc=And I didn’t [i]execute[] anyone who didn’t deserve it.
~01~prompt~panel_033~1_hero3=That’s not the way I heard it.
~01~prompt~panel_033~2_npc=That’s why you never listen to the stories people tell about you. No one’s going to get it right, and if you try to argue with them…
~01~prompt~panel_034~1_hero=So why am I holding this <hero.weaponType>?
~01~prompt~panel_035~1_npc=Because sometimes you execute the brood of a sorcerer. And sometimes sorcerers are willing to go to great lengths to give that brood a chance to avenge themselves.
~01~prompt~panel_035~2_npc=The “weave the bones into weapons” approach is melodramatic, in my opinion...
~01~prompt~panel_036~1_ship=At least it's not Morthagi.
~01~prompt~panel_037~1_npc=And now they’ve led you here. To the most out of the way <overlandTile.bghps:bramble patch/brushpile/rock heap/brushpile/stink-hole> in <overlandTile>.
~01~prompt~panel_038~1_narration=The <hero.weaponType> went cold in <hero>'s hands.
~01~prompt~panel_039.(hero_is_bowBone_>_1)~1_narration=Breaths of old grief and rage blew across <hero.mf:his/her/their> memories.
~01~prompt~panel_040.(hero_NOT_bowBone)~1_narration=Breaths of old grief and rage blew across <hero.mf:his/her/their> memories.
~01~prompt~panel_041~1_npc=If you think killing me will accomplish anything, it won't.
~01~prompt~panel_042~1_npc=I don’t want to fight you. I’ve done nothing but tend to my patch of <overlandTile.biome> for years now, and I’d like to continue for as long as I have left.
~01~prompt~panel_043~1_ship=[gray]<ship.goofball/snark/hothead/80:Well, what does the weapon-wielder say?/Well, what does the weapon-wielder say?/Well, what does the weapon-wielder say?/We’ll follow your lead on this one.>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hero=Avenge the bones.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hero=Leave the <npc.mf:man,woman,person> alone.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_npc=You'd take out an old hermit who's done you no harm?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_hero3=That's not what you are.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_npc=It was hard to read the expression on <npc.mf:his/her/their> face. Disappointment? Resignation?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_npc=It holds true, then. I never executed anyone who didn't deserve it.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_npc=Whatever it was, it was soon replaced by a heavy grimace as the figure began to transform.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_hero3=<hero> felt a transformation as well. A new strength began to flow from the <hero.weaponType>.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_hero3=<hero3.coward/hothead/leader/80:[face:scared]/[face:angry]/[face:angry]/[face:grim]>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~2_ship=<ship.coward/hothead/leader/goofball/snark/80:[face:scared]/[face:angry]/[face:angry]/[face:skeptical]/[face:dubious]/[face:grim]><hero3>... What exactly were those "powers from the stories" you mentioned earlier?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hero=Dredging up this old fight isn’t our job, and it does the Yondering Lands no favors. <hero.snark/goofball/hothead/80:You know what does, though? Using this <hero.weaponType> against the [i]current[] threats./You know what does, though? Using this <hero.weaponType> against the [i]current[] threats./This <hero.weaponType>’s got actual threats to address, and they aren’t here./Any will left in this <hero.weaponType> should be turned toward the more pressing threats we face.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_narration=Around the edges of <hero>'s sight, something stares.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hero=<hero.hothead/greedy/goofball/snark/healer/coward/80:You know I’m right./You know I’m right./You know I’m right./You know I’m right./[face:interested]Please. Understand./[face:interested]Please. Understand./There’s no future here. Just a dead end.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_narration=The <overlandTile.biome> goes quiet, as does the agitated pulling in <hero>’s head.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_npc=...Almost sounds like that “mercy” thing people go on about. Feels different from this side.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_npc=Before you go marching against those threats, let me give you something.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_npc=<npc.mf:He soon re-emerges/She soon re-emerges/They soon re-emerge> from the hovel with a sack.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_npc=The last remnants of a life I no longer lead.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_npc=I would have tossed them into a dung-hole years ago, but they’re good pauldrons. Couldn’t bring myself to waste good pauldrons.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_npc=They don't need to be stuck here nursing old wounds with me any longer.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~1_narration=The trudge back to familiar lands is just as <overlandTile.bghps:overgrown/bug-blown/windswept/prickly/muddy> as the trudge in, if not more so.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_012~1_ship=Bold move of you, back there.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_014~1_hero=<hero.coward/bookish/poet/romantic/healer/leader/80:[face:interested]You think so? I just don’t want to start any more fights than we have to./Not every story has to end in a glorious battle to be satisfying./It’s not often people like us can take a path of peace. You grab the opportunity when it arises./It’s not often people like us can take a path of peace. You grab the opportunity when it arises./It’s not often people like us can take a path of peace.
