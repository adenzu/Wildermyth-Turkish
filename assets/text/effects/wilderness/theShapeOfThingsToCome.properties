~01~~panel_001~1_target=<overlandTile>, huh?
~01~~panel_001~2_target2=Yes. Why, have you been here before?
~01~~panel_002~1_target=No. But...<overlandTile> is where my <target.romantic/60:first love headed off to./mentor vanished.>
~01~~panel_003.(target_is_romantic_>_60)~1_target2=You're kidding! You mean the great romancer still thinks about the one that got away?
~01~~panel_004.(target_is_healer)~1_target2=<NPC>? You've spoken of <NPC.mf:him/her/them> before, but you've never mentioned <NPC.mf:he/she/they> vanished.
~01~~panel_005.(target_is_loner)~1_target2=You've never talked about a mentor.
~01~~panel_006.(target_NOT_romantic_(60))~1_target2=<NPC>? You've spoken of <NPC.mf:him/her/them> before, but you've never mentioned <NPC.mf:he/she/they> vanished.
~01~~panel_007~1_target=<target.romantic/healer/loner/60: Yeah...there's never been anyone like <NPC.mf:him/her/them>. <lover.exists:And, obviously, I wouldn't give up <lover>. Not for the world. But.../I mean, I keep looking, but... maybe that's why I keep looking. Why I'm always looking.>/ Yeah, it was...I don't like thinking of it. The relationship meant a lot to me, and the end wasn't...I wish it hadn't ended the way it did. /There's a lot of things I don't talk about. / Yeah, it was...I don't like thinking of it. The relationship meant a lot to me, and the end wasn't...I wish it hadn't ended the way it did. >
~01~~panel_007~2_target2=<target.romantic/healer/loner/60: <target2.poet/healer/60:  Sounds like a story./ I could listen, if you wanted me to./<target2.poet/healer/60:  I could listen to the story, if you wanted to tell it../ I could listen, if you wanted me to./Sounds painful>.> / Sounds painful. / You're kind of talking about it now.<target2.poet/healer/60:  I could listen to the story, if you wanted to tell it../ I could listen, if you wanted me to.>/ <target2.poet/healer/60: I could listen to the story, if you wanted to tell it./I could listen, if you wanted me to./Sounds painful.>>
~01~~panel_009~1_target=<NPC> was an herbalist. <NPC.mf:He/She/They> headed to <overlandTile> because rumors had come our way of a terrible illness that had taken hold here -- the blue fever, people were calling it --
~01~~panel_010~1_target2=Gorgonism?
~01~~panel_011~1_target=Yes, although we didn't know that then. We had no idea what it was, back then.
~01~~panel_012~1_target=But that was <NPC> for you. Healers and herbalists were needed. So off <NPC.mf:he/she/they> went.
~01~~panel_013~1_target=I should have gone too, of course, but <target.romantic/healer/loner/50: that…would have implied a big commitment, and I wasn’t ready for it then. /that would have left no herbalist in our village. /it wasn’t really playing to my strengths, being around a whole lot of people in a tent-city infirmary. /... I didn't.> We argued about it, if you want to know the truth.
~01~~panel_014~1_target=I figured we'd patch things up when <NPC.mf:he/she/they> came back.
~01~~panel_015~1_target=And then <NPC.mf:he/she/they> didn't.
~01~~panel_016~1_target2=Oh...<target>. Gorgons?
~01~~panel_017~1_target=No, actually. <NPC.mf:He was/She was/They were> found out in the wilderness. <NPC.mf:He'd/She'd/They'd> been...attacked and...and partially eaten by...by a bear.
~01~~panel_017~2_target=I...wish I didn't know that part.
~01~~panel_018~1_target=And I wish I hadn't let <NPC.mf:him/her/them> go alone, but that's... There's nothing I can do about that now.
~01~~panel_020~1_target=High time we set up camp, don't you think?
~01~~panel_021~1_narration=Later...
~01~~panel_022~1_narration=The low clouds are like a sweltering blanket on a summer night. <Target> doesn't know what woke <target.mf:him/her/them>, but anxiety hums in <target.mf:his/her/their> bones. <target.mf:He/She/They> can't possibly lie still.
~01~~panel_023~1_narration=<target.mf:He has/She has/They have> to walk.
~01~~panel_024~1_target=The plain opens up before <target.mf:him/her/them>, but the oppressive clouds do not break. Some unseen need urges <target.mf:him/her/them> forward.
~01~~panel_025~1_target=<target.mf:He was/She was/They were> dreaming of <NPC> -- no surprise, after telling <target2> that story...
~01~~panel_026~1_npc=...and it seems the most natural thing in the world to crest the hill and see <NPC.mf:him/her/them> standing there.
~01~~panel_027~1_npc=I could have sworn I... I must still be...
~01~~panel_028~1_npc=No, <target>. You're not dreaming. You're awake.
~01~~panel_029~1_target=You're [i][b]real?[][] How-- Did you fake your own--? Why would you--?
~01~~panel_030~1_npc=I am <NPC>.
~01~~panel_031~1_npc=And we are more than what <NPC> was.
~01~~panel_032~1_target=<NPC> was eaten by a bear.
~01~~panel_033~1_npc=We are the bear.
~01~~panel_036~1_darken=[i]Now you shall join us.
