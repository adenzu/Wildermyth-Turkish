~01~prompt~panel_001~1_romantic=This, right here. This is why we fight.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_bookish=<bookish.rfln.romantic:It's nice to know there's one thing we can agree on. Very civilized, village festivals. / Very civilized, village festivals. / ERROR: THIS SHOULD NEVER APPEAR / Very civilized, village festivals. >
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_bookish=It's more than "civilized." It's wonderful!
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_romantic=It's all the little everyday things that make everyday life worth living...
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_romantic=Apple pie and hot spiced cider...
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_romantic=...bonfires to dance around...
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_romantic=...and new and interesting people to talk to. Wow. I mean... hello there.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_npc=Hello yourself, stranger. Care to dance?
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=Many hours later...
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_npc=I knew it as soon as I saw you—you [i]are[] just like me. You see the magic in everyday things too. The leap of flame against the darkness...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc=...the music of a new tale...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_npc=...talking until the fire burns out and you're the only ones in the village left awake.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_npc=You're really something special, you know that, <romantic>? You've done so many important and difficult things...and yet you're not all grim and silent...you're still the kind of person who likes to watch the stars.
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_npc=Speaking of which...I know a place...if you want?
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_romantic=This is why I do the dangerous things, <npc>. This is why I fight. Little moments of magic like this.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_romantic=Nights like this I can almost hear the stars singing—can't you? It's like they have a meaning just for us—like every step has brought us to this moment—
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_speech=Wait a minute. I actually hear singing.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_npc=I hear it too. How weird!
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_npc=Come on! Let's go see what it is!
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_romantic=Maybe I should go get the rest of my—
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_npc=Oh—can't it be just us? I've never had a real adventure before.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_npc=And you know what you're doing, so you can take care of me... can't you?
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_romantic=Well...
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_romantic=<romantic.poet/60:All right. An adventure we shall have!/ Of course I can take care of you. Let's go!>
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_romantic=[small] Keep quiet and stay behind me...
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_romantic=[small] It's definitely coming from in here.
~01~prompt~panel_022~2_npc=That's funny. No one's lived here since Mistress McAllister died—
~01~prompt~panel_022~3_speech=[small] Shh!
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_romantic=[small] I think it's coming from the root cellar.
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_romantic=[small]This root cellar is going on forever—
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_romantic=<NPC>, run!
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_npc2=Welcome, <romantic>.
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_romantic=<NPC>, you're not running!
~01~prompt~panel_030~1_romantic=Oh.
~01~prompt~panel_031~1_romantic=You're not running.
~01~prompt~panel_032~1_npc2=There's nothing to run from, <romantic>.
~01~prompt~panel_033~1_romantic=Not for <npc.mf:him! He's/her! She's/them! They're> one of you!
~01~prompt~panel_034~1_romantic=You tricked me!
~01~prompt~panel_034~2_npc=Well, I guess, kind of. But in a good cause!
~01~prompt~panel_035~1_npc2=There is nothing here that you need run from either, <romantic>. There is Truth, there is Joy -- in the depths of the darkness, your eyes will be opened, and you will See what truly is.
~01~prompt~panel_036~1_npc2=<npc3> and <npc4> are to be initiated tonight.
~01~prompt~panel_037~1_npc2=By the next harvest festival, <npc> there will have progressed in <npc.mf:his/her/their> studies sufficiently to join them.
~01~prompt~panel_038~1_npc2=<npc3> and <npc4> have learned as much as they can from book and song and drum, and are ready to descend into the darkness of the underworld and return again reborn.
~01~prompt~panel_039~1_npc2=<romantic>, you are worthy to join them, untaught as you are -- you already have the gift of seeing with the soul and not the eyes.
~01~prompt~panel_040~1_npc3=[small] Hey—wait a minute. You mean <romantic.mf:he doesn't/she doesn't/they don't> have to do all the—
~01~prompt~panel_041~1_npc2=<romantic>, it is rare to find an outsider so obviously chosen by the One Below. Come, join your fellows and embrace your true self.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_romantic=Time to run for reinforcements and clear out this Deepist nest!
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_romantic=I have to get out of here without hurting anyone or getting hurt!
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_romantic=If I play along, I can gather valuable intelligence about the Deepists...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_romantic=[i] Deepists! There are Deepists here!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_romantic=<leader>! <bookish>! Everybody wake up! Hope you've kept your weapons close!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001.(romantic_is_poet)~1_romantic=Oh, love. You know that's not possible.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002.(romantic_is_healer)~1_romantic=<npc2>, I am truly honored by your offer.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003.(romantic_is_leader)~1_romantic=I have to get my team out of here in one piece.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004.(romantic_NOT_poet/healer/leader_(60))~1_romantic=Oh, love. You know that's not possible.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006.(romantic_is_healer)~1_romantic=But this is not my path.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_007.(romantic_is_leader)~1_npc2=Come and join us, <romantic>.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_009.(romantic_is_poet)~1_romantic=You know that's not the story we're in.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_011.(romantic_is_leader)~1_romantic=You know I can't do that, <npc2>. And you're a smart <npc2.mf:man/woman/person>, so I think there are a few other things you know.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_012.(romantic_NOT_poet/healer/leader_(60))~1_romantic=It was one night, <NPC>. A wonderful night.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_013.(romantic_is_poet)~1_npc=Not happily ever after.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_014.(romantic_is_healer)~1_romantic=As a spiritual <npc2.mf:man/woman/person> yourself, you must know that every person descends into the darkness in their own way and finds their way out in their own time.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_015.(romantic_is_leader)~1_romantic=You know <company.name> are the enemy of those who worship the 'One Below,' because of the harm you have caused to the Yondering Lands. You know I can summon the rest of my company with a shout.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_016.(romantic_NOT_poet/healer/leader_(60))~1_romantic=But there was never any chance of it being more than that.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_017.(romantic_is_poet)~1_romantic=Star-crossed lovers.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_018.(romantic_is_healer)~1_romantic=Perhaps the song my soul longs for comes from the One Below, and if that is so, then one day I will hear the song clearly, and on that day I will return.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_019.(romantic_is_leader)~1_romantic=We're outnumbered and on your ground, so we'll probably lose.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_020.(romantic_NOT_poet/healer/leader_(60))~1_romantic=And you knew...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_020.(romantic_NOT_poet/healer/leader_(60))~2_npc=I knew that all along.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_021.(romantic_is_poet)~1_romantic=But I did love looking at the stars with you.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_022.(romantic_is_healer)~1_romantic=But I have not yet arrived at the end of my journey. I have more traveling still to do.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_023.(romantic_is_leader)~1_romantic=But before we do, a lot of your people will die.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_024.(romantic_NOT_poet/healer/leader_(60))~1_romantic=But I did love looking at the stars with you. I'll never forget you, <NPC>.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_025.(romantic_is_poet)~1_romantic=Take good care of <npc>.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_026.(romantic_is_healer)~1_npc2=Go and journey onward, then. Come back to us when you are ready.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_027.(romantic_is_leader)~1_romantic=You don't want to let that happen, <npc2>. So if you pledge to let us leave...I pledge we'll go.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_028.(romantic_NOT_poet/healer/leader_(60))~1_romantic=Take good care of <npc.mf:him/her/them>.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_031.(romantic_is_leader)~1_npc2=Get out.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_034~1_bookish=Very civilized, village festivals.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_034~2_leader=Boring, though. I hope for more excitement tomorrow.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_romantic=...okay.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_npc2=Okay?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_romantic=I am honored by your offer, <npc2>. If the One Below is the source of the song my soul longs for...
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_romantic=...then I must follow where this path leads.
