I just didn't want you to miss this view./\nI knew you'd appreciate the little prank. I thought you'd appreciate this, too./\nYou spend so much time taking care of others, I wanted to do something special for you./\nI know how on edge you've been lately. I thought you'd enjoy a nice, moment of quiet./\nIt seems like you've been carrying the weight of the party on your shoulders this entire journey...I wanted to help you lighten that load./\nIt's so peaceful and quiet. Given all the hustle and bustle lately, I knew you'd want to see this. /\nI know it's not worth anything... but I thought you'd find it priceless./\nI know how much beauty moves you. The Yondering Lands don't get much more beautiful than this./\nYou may play the flirt, but I know you're a romantic at heart./\nDon't tell me you're speechless for once. You?>

You always surprise me./\nThis...this is even better than the time you filled <greedy>'s bedroll with daythorn flowers.../\nYou are the most... you always know just how to lift someone's spirits./\nThis is so... thank you for dragging me here./\nI'm glad I followed you here. I'd follow you anywhere./\nThis is so... thank you for thinking of me./\nThis is so... thank you for sharing this with me./\nThis is so... beautiful. And sappy. And perfect. It's just like you./\nHeh. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to seduce me./\nAre you... actually being sincere for once? It suits you.>
