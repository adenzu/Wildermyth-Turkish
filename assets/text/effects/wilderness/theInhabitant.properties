~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=<hook>’s episodes were nothing new. But they had been getting stronger lately, and more numerous.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=It was only a few moments of twitching and pressure, a brief but desperate fight against something inside of <hook.mf:himself/herself/themself>.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=But the effort always left <hook.mf:him/her/them> <hook.coward/hothead/greedy/80:upset/ill-tempered/ill-tempered/exhausted> and unable to focus.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook=[aqua]Rrghk!
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook=It's alright, <hook>. Keep it together.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=[aqua]Aaarrgh!
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook=Come on... not now...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=[large][neutralAspect][i]ENOUGH.[][][]
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=[neutralAspect]I have struggled inside your <hook.poet/romantic/coward/healer/80:heart/heart/heart/heart/mind> long enough.\n[]
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook=[neutralAspect]I must grudgingly admit, <hook.poet/romantic/snark/greedy/hothead/goofball/loner/bookish/coward/healer/leader:your soul’s roots go deeper than most. They prove hard to pull out./your soul writhes with passion more than most, making it nearly impossible to get a grip on./your soul is more hardened, more twisted and rooted than most. Very inconvenient for me./your soul is more hardened, more twisted and rooted than most. Very inconvenient for me./your soul burns hotter than most. I have not yet been able to keep a grip on it./something about your soul dodges, blinks in and out, makes it impossible to grasp./something about your soul dodges, blinks in and out, makes it impossible to grasp./something about your soul dodges, parries, makes it impossible to grasp./your soul is slippery, wary. I can’t get close enough to it to get a grip./your soul is a stout weed. It refuses to be pulled./your soul is a stout weed. It refuses to be pulled.>\n[]
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hook=What are you? What do you want?
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hook=[neutralAspect]At this moment? What I am is fed up, and what I want is a deal that works for us both.\n[]
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hook=[neutralAspect]Give me a place to exist. Nothing much. An arm, a leg, an eye perhaps. And I won't bother you anymore.\n[]
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_hook=[neutralAspect]I dare say it could turn out advantageous for us both.\n[]
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_hook=<hook.goofball/snark/80:Aaand if this sounds like a pile of hog crap?/Aaand if this sounds like a pile of hog crap?/And if I refuse?>
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_hook=[neutralAspect]I may not be able to take your soul, but I can make your life [i]very difficult.[][]
~02~choice_two~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.hothead/snark/coward/bookish/poet/romantic/80:You think you can intimidate me, brain-worm?/Phuh. Nice try./I can't agree to that./I can't agree to that./I don't make deals with devils./I don't make deals with devils./I don't just hand over body parts that easily.>
~03~choice_one~panel_001~1_hook=Well, when you put it that way...
~03~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=Transformation
~04~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.hothead/snark/coward/poet/80:Just crawl back into whatever mystical hole you sleep in./Trust me, you don't want this body anyway. <hook.age.40:The knees aren't the greatest./It smells pretty funky sometimes.>/I don't want something living in my leg or whatever./Leave me in peace./Just leave me alone.>
~04~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_hook=[neutralAspect]I thought you might be <hook.coward/hothead/greedy/bookish/poet/romantic/80:so spineless./so disagreeable./so proud./so short-sighted./so short-sighted./so proud./unready.>
~04~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hook=[neutralAspect][large][i]This isn't over.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_hook=Hm. Well, that sure could have gone worse.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_hook=Oww!
~04~player_chose_two~panel_008~2_hook=Suddenly, the nerves behind <hook>'s eyes began to jitter and pinch.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_hook=Rrrrgh.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_009~2_actionSmall=shake\n shake
~04~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_narration=The discomfort lessened after an hour or so, but <hook.mf:his/her/their> vision was never quite the same.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_hook=The entertainment of the idea for just a second was enough.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_hook=A force like billowing storm clouds unfolded, and suddenly <hook.mf:his/her/their> gaze felt…
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_narration=...weightier. [aqua]Powerful.[] [blue][b]Shared.[]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_narration=The feeling was jarring.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_hook=[neutralAspect]Okay...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~2_hook=[navy]Okay. Um.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~3_hook=This isn't so bad.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_hook=My head feels a lot clearer, at least.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_hook=Ohhh crud, how am I going to explain this to the others?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_hook=I hope <ship> <hook.rfln.ship:doesn’t run me out of the Yondering Lands over this./<ship.healer/leader/coward/snark/goofball/bookish/hothead/poet/romantic/loner/greedy:will understand./doesn't get all serious about this./doesn't quit the group over this./doesn't give me some horrible nickname.../and I can laugh about this later./doesn't ask too many questions./doesn't throw a fit over this./doesn't get all doom-y about this./will understand./will understand./doesn't get all, "I told you so" about this.>/doesn’t break up with me over this./--->
