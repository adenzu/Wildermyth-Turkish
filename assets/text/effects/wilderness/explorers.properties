~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=In the darkest heart of <overlandTile>...
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_target=Thank goodness we've nearly finished scouting the area. Feels like we've been patrolling <overlandTile.bghps:this forest/this grassland/these hills/this forest/this swamp> for weeks.
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_hero=Actually... we should have been out of here [b][i]two days[][] ago...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_target=What!? Why didn't you say anything?
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/leader/50:\nI wasn't sure. Not 100%. I thought I might have miscalculated. But now.../\nI wasn't sure. Not 100%. And I was really hoping maybe I was wrong. But now.../\nI wasn't sure. Not 100%. I didn't want to alarm anyone over a hunch. But now... /\nI wasn't sure. Not 100%. But now...>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_target=<target.bookish/goofball/loner/snark/60:\nBut... we have maps. Maps we've been following! Are you saying the maps are wrong?/\nWhich means... what, exactly? Did <town> up and move on us? Did you read a map or something wrong?/\nThen we're lost. Or perhaps the maps are wrong./\nWell, I'm pretty sure this isn't <town>, so I'm guessing [b][i]you[][] got us lost. Am I wrong?/\nSo... what does that mean? Are we lost? Are the maps wrong?>
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_hero=...now I'm [b][i]certain[][]. We should have reached <town> this morning at the latest.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hero=No. I think... I think the [b][i]land[][] is wrong.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_target=The land is wrong? What does that even--
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_volunteer=No... <hero.mf:he's/she's/they're> right... I can feel it. <volunteer.bookish/healer/loner/poet/60:An amorphous yet pervasive wrongness./A wrongness affecting body and mind./A presence in my head that's not my own./A whisper of wrongness, rustling my mind like a bird rustles leaves./Like something in the air.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_volunteer=Something is [b][i]warping[][] our senses...
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_target=Like what? Thrixl?
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_hero=Thrixl would have attacked by now.
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_volunteer=Agreed. This is something different...
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_target=<target.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/leader/50:\nNot just different. [b][i]Dangerous[][].../\nI was really hoping you weren't gonna say that.../\nGreat. More [b][i]different[][]. Anyone else sick of different?/\nAs long as it's something we can kill.../\nThen stay alert. Whatever it is, let's meet it head on.../\nI hate different.>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_target=So where is this thing?
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_volunteer=If it trapped us in the <overlandTile.biome> this long, it must somehow be making us walk in circles--
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_target=Of course! Luring us in towards the center...
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_hero=Circles? Or a [b][i]spiral[][]?
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_target=...which means the center is where we'll find it!
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/leader/50:\nI could triangulate its precise position if I knew exactly how our senses were being warped./\nUnless we just get out of here... but how can we escape without knowing exactly [b][i]how[][] our senses are being warped?/\nThen that's where we make our stand. Assuming we can determine exactly how our senses were being warped.../\nI might be able to guide us there, if I knew exactly [b][i]how[][] our senses were being warped.>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_volunteer=The shadows! Look at our shadows on the ground!
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hero=Yes! Our shadows look like they're bending. They're being warped by the effect. And if they're being warped at that angle...
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hero=Then the center of the spiral is [b][i]this[][] way...
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hero=...and the outer edge is [b][i]that[][] way...
~02~choice_one~panel_001.(target_is_hothead_>_60)~1_target=Let's track it down and kill it...
~02~choice_one~panel_001.(target_is_hothead_>_60)~2_hero=<target.eventRoll:roll_one|difficulty_one>
~02~choice_one~panel_002.(target_NOT_hothead)~1_volunteer=Let's track it down and kill it...
~02~choice_one~panel_002.(target_NOT_hothead)~2_hero=<volunteer.eventRoll:roll_one|difficulty_one>
~03~choice_two~panel_001.(target_is_hothead_>_60)~1_volunteer=We should forget it and get out of here.
~03~choice_two~panel_002.(target_NOT_hothead)~1_target=We should forget it and get out of here.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.hothead/poet/snark/60:\nThen let's charge ahead! If it wants to lure us in, I say we oblige it--fists first!/\nOn we go, then. Into the very heart of the darkness around us./\nIt's luring us in. Finding it won't be the problem. Doing it on [b][i]our[][] terms will./\nWell... it [b][i]is[][] trying to draw us in. I guess finding it shouldn't be too hard.>
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_002~1_hero=This way. Let's go...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_003~1_hero=And so...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_003~2_hero=We're close...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_004~1_volunteer=I feel it.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_005~1_target=There!
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_006~1_darken=[large][i][neutralAspect]HHRRAAAARRGG!
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_007~1_target=ATTACK!!!
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_007~2_volunteer=YAAAAAAH!!!
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_008~1_volunteer=Urrrk!
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_009~1_target=Oww!
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010~1_target=I can't hit it... it's like my aim is always off...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010~2_volunteer=It's still warping our senses... we can't tell where it truly is!
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_011~1_hero=It can't warp my ARROW'S senses...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_012~1_hero=It wanted to bring us to [b][i]it[][]? Let it bring [b][i]this[][]!
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_014~1_darken=[i]HHRRAAA--
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_014~2_hero=[neutralAspect]THUNK
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_015~1_target=<target.bookish/hothead/leader/poet/60:\nCommendable marksmanship!/\nHA! That showed it!/\nWell done./\nYour arrow flies true!/\nNice shot!>
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_015~2_volunteer=<volunteer.coward/goofball/healer/leader/snark/60:\nThank goodness! I was getting nervous there.../\nYeah. I'm glad you're on [b][i]our[][] side.../\nA shame you had to kill it, but it left us no choice./\nGood plan. Smart thinking./\nYou couldn't've done that at the [b][i]start[][] of the fight?/And just in the nick of time...>
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_016~1_narration=Eying the field of old equipment scattered about...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_016~2_hero=Whatever it was, I'd say it's been feeding here for awhile.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_017~1_volunteer=<volunteer.coward/healer/hothead/leader/greedy/snark/50:\n**shudder** Fine, but be quick about it. This place gives me the wiggins.../\nAnd inter any bones we find. We should give these poor souls a proper funeral./\nI call dibs on the best [b][i]weapon[][].../\nAnd pay our proper respects to the dead. I'm sure you meant that too, right?/\nUseful... or valuable... or powerful... or valuable.../\nSure. Once we clean the moss, bones, and ichor off it.../\nI'm just glad to know we've made this part of the Yondering Lands safe again.>
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_017~2_target=We should collect this stuff. We might find something useful.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_018~1_hero=Come on. Let's get out of here...
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.hothead/poet/snark/60:\nThen let's charge ahead! If it wants to lure us in, I say we oblige it--fists first!/\nOn we go, then. Into the very heart of the darkness around us./\nIt's luring us in. Finding it won't be the problem. Doing it on [b][i]our[][] terms will./\nWell... it [b][i]is[][] trying to draw us in. I guess finding it shouldn't be too hard.>
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_002~1_hero=This way. Let's go...
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_003~1_hero=And so...
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_003~2_hero=We're close...
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_004~1_volunteer=I feel it.
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_005~1_target=There!

~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_015~2_volunteer=My head! The pain!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_016~1_hero=I can't see straight... feels like the world is spinning...
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_017~1_volunteer=It must be our senses returning to normal... it's making everything wobbly...
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_017~2_target=<target.coward/goofball/healer/leader/poet/60:\nWhat is it? Another attack?/\nOw! I liked it better getting hit in the face.../\nIt's vertigo... it's so intense.../\nSteady, everyone... try to fight through it.../\nThis is a pain beyond my bleakest nightmares.../\nI think I'm gonna throw up...>
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_018~1_hero=Come on. Let's get out of here...
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_018~2_target=Ugh.... can I just, like, lie down for a minute first...?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.coward/hothead/leader/romantic/60:\nGetting out of here sounds great to me./\nFine. I'd rather stay and fight, but I'll abide by the will of the group./\nAgreed. Discretion is the better part of valor, here./\nRight! Time to <hero.mf:pull up our pants/straighten our skirts/pull on our clothes> and skedaddle like we just heard <hero.awm:the milkmaid's father/the inkeeper's wife> coming home./\nOut we go then.> Just one problem...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_hero=It's still warping our senses... so how can we be sure we're staying on course?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_volunteer=The rocks... It can't warp the senses of the rocks...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_volunteer=...and I can [b][i]interfuse[][] with them.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_target=Huh?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_volunteer=If it's warping our senses, I'll just close my eyes, interfuse with the rocks, and let that guide us.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_hero=Got any better ideas?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_009~2_target=Nope.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_narration=And so...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_010~2_hero=Are you sure? I really think we're going the wrong way...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_010~3_volunteer=See? The rocks guide us true...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_011~1_volunteer=I'm sure... in fact...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_012~1_volunteer=...we're free! I no longer feel the effect upon our senses.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_013~1_hero=<hero.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/snark/60:\nTake the win.../\nYou know what they say: any mysterious, sense-warping, lost-in-the-<overlandTile.biome>-for-two-days presence you can walk away from is a [b][i]good[][] one.../\nShould have tried to fight it. Bet [b][i]that[][] would have been impressive.../\nLet's just be grateful we all made it out in one piece./\nYou wanna go back in and try again? Be my guest./\n<volunteer> just used <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> magical soul-sharing powers to become one with nature and lead us out. Seems pretty impressive to me.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_013~2_target=Huh. I thought escaping would be... I don't know, more impressive somehow...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_014~1_target=Too bad we'll never know what was causing that effect...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_014~2_volunteer=<volunteer.bookish/coward/healer/leader/loner/60:\nIndeed. But at least we can record it on our maps./\nEh. I can live with that./\n...or if anyone else will fall victim in the future.../\n...and let's hope no one else ever falls victim to it again./\n...or who else may have wandered into its grip in the past.../\nThere are some mysteries even we dare not solve...>
