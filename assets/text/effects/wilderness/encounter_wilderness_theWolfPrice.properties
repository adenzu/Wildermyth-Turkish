~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=Upon the hill's summit...
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_narration=...nothing's waiting for them.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_coward=<coward.goofball/healer/loner:What we [i]have[] found is a pretty good picnic spot./Well... There's a big rock and a couple wind-worsted old pines./It's a decent view, at least. Look, you can see the salt-road...>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_volunteer=Then it begins.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_narration=A thrumming.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_narration=It grows louder...
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_actionSmall=...rumble...
~01~prompt~panel_009~4_actionSmall=...trumble...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_narration=...and louder...
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_narration=...until the stone underfoot chatters and shakes.
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_actionSmall=...scrumble!...
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_narration=It grows louder...
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_action=...scccrrrooowww...
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_narration=...until it's a mighty growl. Clamorous! Thundering...!
~01~prompt~panel_012~3_action=...RRROOOOWWW...!
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_narration=And then it resolves.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_narration=The voice of a carnivore, cunning and crooning. Warning them to run, promising to give chase.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_darken=[green][actionLarge]I am the one...
~01~prompt~panel_015~3_narration=A voice.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_darken=[bold][green][action]...the one you have hunted so long...[]
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_darken=[action][bold][green]...through <volunteer.coward/healer/hothead/loner/poet/snark:tears/woods/cups/darks/hills/lies>\n   and <volunteer.bookish/goofball/greedy/leader/romantic:riddles/whims/coins/dreams/stars>.[]
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_darken=[actionSmall][bold][green]You have hunted so long for me. And for a <volunteer.mf:brotherhood/sisterhood/fellowship> that should be yours.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_volunteer=[small]A name...?
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_darken=[action][bold][green]Do you know \n     my name?
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_darken=[actionSmall][bold][green]It was the gift I gave to your ancestors. []
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_darken=[actionSmall][bold][green]They walked my myth over green field and fallow. To the curves and corners of being, they walked.[]
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_volunteer=[i]How?[] How would I?
~01~prompt~panel_022~2_darken=[actionLarge][bold][green]Do you know \n  my name!?
~01~prompt~panel_023~2_darken=[actionSmall][bold][green]A blessing earned through ancient service, an oath written in steps and trails.\n      And sealed with a name. You only need to know it.[]
~01~prompt~panel_024~2_darken=[action][green]I'll ask you once more...
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_volunteer=[large]Lochias!
~01~prompt~panel_025~2_darken=[actionLarge][bold][green]Do you know MY NAME!!?
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_coward=<volunteer.poet/snark/60:<volunteer> pulls the name up like a rooty weed out of <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> heart. <volunteer.mf:He's/She's/They're> unsure how <volunteer.mf:he/she/they> found it, or how long it's been growing.../<volunteer> surprises <volunteer.mf:himself/herself/themself>. It's not something <volunteer.mf:he does/she does/they do> often. <volunteer.mf:He's/She's/They're> unsure how the name came to <volunteer.mf:him/her/them>.../It's like reading a fairytale from your childhood only to realize how disturbing it is: <volunteer> doesn't like knowing the name...>
~01~prompt~panel_026~2_narration=...but <volunteer.mf:he's/she's/they're> sure it's [green][b]Right[].
~01~prompt~panel_027~2_darken=[action][bold][green]Yes. I am Lochias. Your Wolf God. \nAnd now... you may take my oath.\nAbandon your humanity, my <volunteer.mf:boy/girl/child>...[]
~01~prompt~panel_027~3_darken=[green][action]...and be blessed as wolfkind.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_volunteer=It... feels like... coming home.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_self=[b][green]Transformation[][][green]!
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_coward=<coward.goofball/hothead/leader:Take an oath? <volunteer>, no one does that anymore!/Oaths?! Don't be a flapping fool, <volunteer>!/<volunteer>, let's go! Nothing about abandoning your humanity can be good!>
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.goofball/loner/romantic:It's been a while, Woof-god./Still hungry, old Lochias?/Nobody loves you, do they, old Lochias?>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_target=<volunteer> kneels, and beneath <volunteer.mf:him/her/them> a green light pools. Dandelions rise yellow out of the sparse windscraped dirt. They grow old and white, throw their seeds, then wilt to nothing.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_target=<volunteer.leader/poet/snark:Feels like a thousand megalithic wasps are whining, trapped, in this bone jar teetering on <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> shaky shoulders./...beneath the earth and behind <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> eyes./...of the deepest, oldest, wolfiest breath.>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_narration=The godrock <volunteer.mf:he kneels/she kneels/they kneel> upon hums. It cracks somewhere inside. <volunteer.leader/poet/snark:A shrill sundering howl reverberates in <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> skull./A geode of understanding splits and catches light.../A tremendous odor overcomes <volunteer.mf:him/her/them>...>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_coward=<volunteer>...
~07~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_volunteer=Let's go.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_coward=The speaking hill . . .
~07~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_narration=. . . is left to bark at the sunset.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.goofball/loner/romantic:When you deal with old Lochias, you must remember a woof doesn't bargain fair./Ask yourself why a hungry wolf offers his grin to the flock./Shall we pity him? Long ago, Lochias was strong, his name a terror upon the wind.>
~08~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_hook=<hook.goofball/loner/romantic:You know that I once haggled with Lochias? You don't, but I really did./A god is that way. It is a creature of great power, cunning, viciousness./If your ancestors walked for Lochias, I'll tell you it was not of faith but fear.>
~08~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_speech=<hook.goofball/loner/romantic:And darn these wild gods! He offered me nothing but a beard and a nose-job. I said, 'No thanks, Woof!'/All things that spend too long marinating in their own strength.../Then, he would not ask for oaths. And so he got none, and his name died with the last tears it wrung...>
~08~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_hook=<hook.goofball/loner/romantic:No thanks! Poor woof. No thank you. But...!/...become useless to the world: strong, sad and useless./Now he is only hungry and alone.>
~08~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_volunteer=Stooping, <hook> takes an offering from a small stone bowl, and places it in <volunteer>'s hands.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_006.(hook_is_goofball)~1_hook=At least his relics look cool!
~08~player_chose_three~panel_007.(hook_is_loner)~1_hook=A keepsake for you, <volunteer>. Maybe you can give it purpose.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_008.(hook_is_romantic)~1_hook=Do not pity him, <volunteer>. But remember him if you must.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_009~1_volunteer=They leave the hill in silence and distance...
~08~player_chose_three~panel_010~1_coward=From the other side, <coward.goofball/hothead/greedy/romantic:it just looks like a big middle finger/it just looks like a giant wolfpatty/it looks just like any ordinary landlump/it looks like a certain smooching-spot I know>!
