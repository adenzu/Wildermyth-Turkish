~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hero=You have my memories... you know my thoughts... it's like there are [b][i]TWO[][] of me!
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hero=If you're really [b][i]me[][], then maybe we can talk this out.

~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_hero=I didn't know what else to do so... I ran.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_volunteer=It must have been some kind of changeling creature.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~2_volunteer2=Now that you're gone, it will most likely revert back to its natural state...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_volunteer=...unless it doesn't. In which case, I guess there'd be another [b][i]you[][] wandering the world...
