~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=On the far edges of <overlandTile>...
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_hero=Well, that's another patch of the Yondering Lands safely explored.
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_rival=<rival.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:\nAnd, more importantly, mapped! Some of these old charts were [b][i]hopelessly[][] out of date./\nThank goodness. Now we can get out of here and back to safer realms./\nAll thanks to the might heroes of <company>! They should build us statues!/\nYes. I imagine all the children of <overlandTile> are sleeping a little easier tonight.../\nMeh. Maybe next time we’ll see a little action!/\nLet’s get some sleep. Tomorrow we move out for our next assignment./\n[b][i]Finally[][]. I don’t know about anyone else, but I could use some time to myself./\nYes, and with nary a coin to show for it.../\nSad, isn’t it? Every day the wilds get less wild. The unknown becomes known. The world as it is slips away into the world it [b][i]will[][] be.../\nPerhaps tomorrow we can sleep in an inn. I haven’t had a chance to flirt with a <rival.awm:lusty barmaid/strapping stablehand> in weeks.../\nGreat. One down, a zillion more to go…>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hero=<rival.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:\n”More importantly”? Ugh. You [b][i]would[][] say that./\nUgh. You [b][i]would[][] say that./\nUgh. The day they build a statue of [b][i]you[][].../\nUgh. You [b][i]would[][] say that./\nUgh. You [b][i]would[][] say that./\nOh, <rival.mf:yessir, Mr. Boss Man, sir!/yes ma’am, Madame Boss Lady, ma’am./aye-aye, mighty Commander-in-Chief!>/\nUgh. We could all use some time off from [b][i]you[][]./\nUgh. You [b][i]would[][] say that./\nUgh. Give it a rest, will ya?/\nUgh. Do you ever think of anything else?/\nCan you ever take anything seriously?>
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_rival=Excuse me? What does [b][i]that[][] mean?
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hero=<rival.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:\nIt means that I’m tired of you and your maps and your books!/\nIt means that if you’re going to grouse about danger all the time, maybe you should go back to <rival.homeTown>!/\nIt means that if someone’ll build a statue of you, they’ll build a statue of anyone! /\nIt means that I’m sick of your sanctimonious, do-gooding attitude! /\nIt means that I’m tired of you always spoiling for a fight!/\nIt means that I don’t take orders from you!/\nIt means that if you’re so sick of being around the rest of us, maybe you should stay home! /\nIt means that there’s more to life than your money-purse and personal comfort! /\nIt means that I’m sick of you blathering on all the time!/\nIt means that I’m sick of you going on and on about your romantic exploits--or lack thereof!/\nIt means that I’m sick of your attitude! >
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_healer=Easy, <hero>. We're all tired, and you two have been snippy with each other a lot lately--
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hero=<rival.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:\nWe’re trying to save lives, and you think it’s [b][i]more important[][] that we made a map? Get out of your head for once and look at the world!/\nI don't know about you, but I'm fighting to do some good out here! Danger is part of the job. If you can't accept that, then quit./\nYou never take anything seriously, you make everything into a joke. We deal with life-and-death [b][i]crises[][] on a daily basis, but you’re always fooling around! /\nI mean, seriously. “The children are sleeping easier tonight”? Who even [b][i]thinks[][] like that? Gimme a break and get over yourself! /\nHow many times have you put the rest of us in danger because you couldn’t hold yourself in check? Too many, if you ask me./\nNobody put you in charge. I’m sick and tired of you [b][i]bossing[][] everyone around all the time, like you somehow know better than us. /\nI mean, seriously, we got into this to help people, but I don't think you even [b][i]like[][] people./\nI’m so sick of you always thinking about [b][i]yourself[][]. We're out here to help others. Remember them? Others?/You go on and on about who even knows what anymore? Wilds, unwild. Known, unknown. What does that even [b][i]mean[][]?/\nYour loins are your business, not ours, and I for one am tired of hearing about them./\nThe snide comments, the eye-rolls, the spiteful asides. The constant disrespect you display towards everyone.>
