~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=I’ve always wanted an excuse to comb through <overlandTile>. <hook.bookish/loner/greedy/leader/romantic:I’ve heard it has the highest number of myths per square mile of anywhere in the Yondering Lands./Lots of ruins, not a lot of people./Best relic-hunting in the land, I’ve heard./Just perilous enough to be a bonding experience./Dramatic vistas, picturesque ruins. Great place to bring a date.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_target2=Sounds right up your alley. Except for the monsters, I assume?
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook=That’s the thing. There’s been no sign of them since we got here. None of their debris, none of those noises in the night.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_target3=Maybe we lucked out this time.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_target3=Think it’d be too much to hope for a few days’ vacation?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_target3=The sword Night Shard is supposed to be around here somewhere, and that would be a fantastic…
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_target3=Um.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_npc=Night Shard?
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=I’m afraid we’ll be going home with that.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc=There are markets in low places that would pay high prices for something like this, and we’re—
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_npc=<hook>.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook=...<npc>.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_npc=Well, fan-cy that.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_npc=Ha! <hook.mf:Does he/Does she/Do they>!
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_target2=You know <npc.mf:him/her/them>?
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_npc=“Former colleagues,” let’s say.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hook=It's not important.
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_target2=Wait, what would you have been doing with people like—
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_npc=Oh but it might be, to your friends here. I assume you folks are okay with having a [i]traitor[] in your group.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_hook=That was a long time ago.
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_npc=Believe me, my brother knows that as well as you do. He’s still in prison.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_hook=I didn't have a choice.
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_npc=You always have a choice.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_target2=Hey!
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_target2=<target2.hothead/goofball/snark/80:Excuse me, I don’t know who [i]you[] are, but <hook> and the rest of us are <company>./Hey, now sounds like a great time for introductions. Hi. We’re <company>./Hey, now sounds like a great time for introductions. Hi. We’re <company>./From what I’m gathering here, there’s some history. But <hook> is a vital part of <company> now.>
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_target2=<target2.hothead/goofball/snark/80:And up ‘til now we’ve only been fighting monsters, but if you want us to change that, be my guest./Fighting monsters. Making the lands safe. All that good stuff. /Fighting monsters. Making the lands safe. All that good stuff./And we’ve been throwing ourselves into battle so that people like [i]you[] can walk around places like [i]this[] in peace.>
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_npc=...Huh.
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_npc=So you’re some kind of hero, now? Sure.
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_npc=<hook.bookish/greedy/loner/leader/romantic:Always searching for the next puzzle to solve, the next goose-chase mystery. Whatever keeps you busy, eh?/You’re in it for the spoils as much as you ever were, just with a more convenient excuse this time./Tolerate this job for as long as you will, but eventually you’ll desert them too./Must be nice to have something that makes you feel so important./But tell me, was it one of the other heroes you fell in love with this time, or was it just the idea of the whole thing?>
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_target2=[gray]<target2.hothead/healer/60:You want me to <target2.whm:punch 'em?/punch 'em?/set 'em on fire?>/This <npc.mf:guy/lady/person>’s really got a chip on <npc.mf:his/her/their> shoulder, huh?/Ugh. How long do you think <npc.mf:he/she/they>’s been saving that line?>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hook=I know one thing. You’re not leaving with that sword.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hook=...You could still join us in this fight.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_narration=Legacy Cost: <int:2+RECRUIT_COST_ADJUSTMENT>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_hook=I have a hunch we’ll put it to much better use than you will.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_npc=<hook.bookish/greedy/leader/loner/romantic:<hook> thinking <hook.mf:he/she/they> has things all figured out? Knows the correct answer? I’m not surprised./”<npc>, you should definitely give me that legendary sword.” Do you realize how that sounds? Coming from you?/The days when I listen to [i]you,[] <hook>, are long past./You’ll have to forgive the fact that your hunches have no weight with me these days./”Better use?” Meaning you think it’ll make [i]you[] look snazzier? Please.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_npc=Feel free to come and take it, though.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hook=Look, I know you get around.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_hook=You can’t have missed the danger that’s been building in the Yondering Lands. It’s not too late to face it head-on, to play a part in this story.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~2_hook=You always have a choice.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hook=Plus, you weren’t wrong—<hook.bookish/greedy/loner/leader/romantic:it does keep you busy./the spoils are pretty good./it’s surprisingly tolerable./it is important./people do love heroes.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_npc=...Wait, you're serious?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_npc=You betray me, you take my brother from me, and then you come trotting up years later telling me to [i]join you?[]
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_npc=Alright. You know what?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_npc=Anybody who wants to join the traitor, go right ahead. Walk over there.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_npc=*scoot*
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_npc=<npc2>?!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_npc2=<npc2.coward/bookish/romantic/snark/goofball/healer/80:Y-yes./<hook.mf:He/She/They> makes a convincing point./Please, like I ever had a future in this. With you./So… turns out I never actually liked you very much./So… turns out I never actually liked you very much./If there can be a path for <hook>, there’s probably one for me./<hook> seems to be doing quite well.> I don’t want to wait around until I end up in prison too.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~1_npc=Two traitors taken care of in one day, then. Not so bad after all.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_012~1_hook=Wait! Listen.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_013~1_hook=Take the sword.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_014~1_hook=[i]Take the sword.[] <npc2> leaves with us. Nobody gets hurt.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_014~2_target2=[gray]Wait, really?...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_016~1_npc=Well, then. Look at <hook>, <hook.leader/romantic/loner/greedy/bookish:taking charge of that situation./cutting such a <hook.mf:dashing/radiant/dashing>, protective figure./ever the master of the disengage./giving up something shiny!/the quick thinker.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_017~1_npc=No wonder you became a hero.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_018~1_npc=I'd say it suits you, but you'd probably take that as a compliment.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_020~1_npc2=...They're gone?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_022~1_hook=Right??
~05~player_chose_two~panel_022~2_npc2=<npc2.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/snark/leader/healer/loner/80:Oh phew! I can breathe again!/Oh phew! I can breathe again!/Oh phew! I can breathe again!/Phew! Ten more seconds and I might’ve started in on the [i]real[] insults./Phew! Ten more seconds and I might’ve started in on the [i]real[] insults./Phew! Feels good to have [i]that[] over with./Phew! Feels good to have [i]that[] over with./Phew! Feels good to have [i]that[] over with./Phew! Breath was a little… bated there for a minute.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_023~1_hook=At least we'll have a lot to talk about on the hike back out of here.
