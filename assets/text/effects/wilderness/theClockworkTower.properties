~01~prompt~panel_001~1_leader=<loner>, what's the situation up ahead?
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_loner=I ... you have to see this yourself. Come with me.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_leader=They're living side by side with Morthagi!
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_leader=AHH!
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_loner=WHOA!
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_npc4=HELLO, friends!
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_npc4=Isn't the view from here great? You can see everything for miles around!
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc4=Say, you two look tired and hungry! Why don't you all come on down and join us for dinner!
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_leader=Uh, sure, thanks.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_npc4=We do a huge communal feast every night, and there's always plenty.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_leader=Hi, thanks.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_npc=Hi, friends!
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_npc2=Welcome to <town>!
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_leader=Okay, that's just creepy.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_leader=Split up. Enjoy the party, but stay on guard. This feels ... off.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=Later ...
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_leader=Well?
~01~prompt~panel_012~3_loner=Something weird [i]is []going on. Everyone is just so ... happy.
~01~prompt~panel_012~4_hothead=Isn't that a good thing?
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_loner=I just saw a woman cut herself by mistake and everyone just laughed. Including her!!
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_leader=Oh, come on, I just finished eating.
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_loner=Maybe it's something in the food ...
~01~prompt~panel_014~3_hothead=Uhm, did you two check that out yet?
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_leader=No clue, but it looks like some sort of energy is flowing in and out of it.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_loner=What is it?
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_monster=Welcome, strangers. I see you’ve found the Merry Maker.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_loner=What does it do?
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_loner=At what cost?
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_monster=Why, it provides the townsfolk with unlimited happiness!
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_monster=Oh nothing big, just a tiny bit of their life essence. Siphoned off to power the machines.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_loner=Let me guess. Signed in blood.
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_monster=Now then, don’t look so horrified, they all knew the price going in! I have signed contracts.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_loner=This is wrong. We have to free them.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_leader=They chose this. It’s not up to us to interfere.
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_loner=We'll come back later and destroy it!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_monster=I'm sorry you feel that way.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_npc=Bye, friends!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_npc3=Come again some day!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_001~1_narration=Later ...
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_001~2_leader=Looks like everyone is asleep. You sure about this?
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_002~1_loner=Yes. We can't leave them as slaves to this thing.
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_003~1_leader=<loner> ... we're about to have company. Hurry!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_004~1_loner=GARRR!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_004~2_action=TWOCK!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_005~1_narration=As the shovel slides in, a terrible screeching fills the night as the gears grind to a halt.
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_005~2_loner=It worked!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_005~3_hothead=SCREEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_006~1_hothead=You did it, but I think we should get out of here!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_006~2_action=bbrrrRRRRR!!!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_007~1_loner=It's gonna blow! RUN!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_007~2_hothead=RUMMMBLE!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_008~1_loner=It ... it's not gonna blow. Whew.
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_008~2_hothead=fffffffeeeeeerrrrmmmmm
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_008~3_hothead=sssssssssss
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_009~1_narration=Around the city, the sound of Morthagi constructs powering down can be heard.
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_009~2_actionSmall=ZZzzzzmmmmm....
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_010~1_monster=You fools! I still have a few machines left to take you out with!
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_011~1_npc=Actually, no. You don't.
~07~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_011~2_npc2=Ah, anger. I'd almost forgotten this feeling ...
~08~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_001~1_narration=Later ...
~08~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_001~2_leader=Looks like everyone is asleep. You sure about this?
~08~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_002~1_loner=Yes. We can't leave them as slaves to this thing.
~08~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_003~1_leader=<loner> ... we're about to have company. Hurry!
~08~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_004~1_loner=GARRR!
~08~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_004~2_action=Clink!
~08~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~1_narration=As the shovel slides in, a terrible screeching fills the night as the gears grind to a halt.
~08~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~2_loner=Oops, I meant to get it more to the right ...
~08~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~3_hothead=SCREEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
~08~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_006~1_loner=It's gonna blow! RUN!
