~01~prompt~panel_001~1_snark=Well shoot, if it weren't for this Heartwood, <overlandTile> would have been a [i]complete[] waste of time.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_goofball=Rrrk. I forgot how much work actually taking down a tree is.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_snark=Nah, my arms are all wobbly too.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_goofball=You'd think in our line of work, it wouldn't be the most exerting thing we'd do in a day.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_snark=I think it's different muscles from the fighting ones.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_snark=<target> could probably tell you the details.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_goofball=So how about it, are you in the market for a new <snark.whm:spear/bow/staff>?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_goofball=This stuff looks particularly... <snark.whm:unyielding./springy./er, magical.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_snark=Since when are you an expert?
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_goofball=I don't need to be an expert, look at that grain! It's gorgeous!
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_goofball=Is it just me, or do the trees seem to be rather close in here?
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_goofball=It was not just <goofball.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_action=[green]Grrrrkkggg...
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_snark=Stand and fight!
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_goofball=Forget the wood! Let's beat it!
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_volunteer=<volunteer> feels a green humming in <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> bones...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_actionLarge=[green]Roarggggh!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_goofball=<goofball.healer/hothead/greedy/60:Okay fine, I'd be mad too, if someone tried to make a <snark.whm:spear/bow/staff> out of my cousin./Urgh, maybe if we had more people.../Urgh, maybe if we had more people.../I'd rather keep my own limbs, thank you.>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_volunteer=[green]Rrrrmmm?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_volunteer=[green]You do not look like a tree. And yet you are... Elmish?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_volunteer=Oh, this? It happened a while ago. I got this mean old splinter, you see? And thenâ€”
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_volunteer=[green]Hush. There is only a bit of elm. I can barely make out the rest of what you say.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_volunteer=*sniffff*
~07~player_chose_three~panel_007~1_volunteer=[green]Your sap runs strong.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_007~2_volunteer=[green]Some elm saw something in you.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_008~1_volunteer=[green]I trust an elm's judgment.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_013.(snark_is_theme_tree)~1_goofball=Did that tree just [i]sniff[] you?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_014.(snark_NOT_theme_tree)~1_snark=Did that tree just [i]sniff[] you?
