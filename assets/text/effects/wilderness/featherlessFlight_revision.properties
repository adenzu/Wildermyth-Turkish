~01~prompt~panel_003~2_actionSmall=...whush...
~01~prompt~panel_003~5_bookish=[small]Oogh.
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_bookish=<bookish.bookish/loner/poet/romantic/snark:[face:grim]I understand what the trailwarden meant now. When <npc.mf:he/she/they> described the gusts up here as [i]arbitrary[]./[face:default]The old trailwarden was right about the wind. Way it comes and goes./[face:default]I see what the trailwarden meant. How swiftly the wind changes. Arbitrary, <npc.mf:he/she/they> called it. It's a good word./[face:interested]Not a friendly wind. Not the bracing kind you want at your back. Arbitrary, was the trailwarden's word. Get what <npc.mf:he/she/they> meant now./[face:skeptical]Shifty winds.

It won't get too much worse?/[face:interested]Hey, <volunteer.exists:anyone else/you> feel your skin cracking?/Mainly wish it wasn't so [i]dry.[] I'm calling \nthe first bath when we get down.[face:talking]/Mm.

~01~prompt~panel_006~1_bookish=Hm?
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_bookish=[small][i]...oh.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/loner/poet/romantic/snark:Something here you might want to see, <hero2.parentOf.bookish:<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<hero2>>. \n[small]Something, hm. Is that the right word?/You wanted me to say if I spotted something? Well./[face:interested]Over here, <hero2.parentOf.bookish:<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<hero2.loverOf.bookish:love/<hero2>>>. You'll want to see this for yourself./You'll want to see this for yourself, <hero2.parentOf.bookish:<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<hero2>>. Found \nsomething unexpected./[face:skeptical]Over here. There's a... you know. A body.>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_bookish=Mm. A Drauv.

~01~prompt~panel_009~3_narration=It's a creature's crumpled remains, resting in the shade \nbetween boulders. The bones are maggotclean.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/loner/poet/romantic/snark:One of their wingknights. And... a young one, by the size of <bookish.mf:him/her/them>. Inexperience, maybe, got <bookish.mf:him/her/them> caught in a squall./<bookish.mf:He was/She was/They were> a flier. Maybe got caught in one of these \ngusts. Crashed./<bookish.mf:He's/She's/They're> a smaller one. A fledgling. Maybe just received \n<bookish.mf:his/her/their> wings. And then... got caught in a sudden squall./[face:interested]<bookish.mf:He/She/They> must've been a young one. Adventurous, softscaled... \ngiven to flying too high or too low./[face:skeptical]Guessing <bookish.mf:he wasn't/she wasn't/they weren't> an experienced flier. Didn't know how to handle the gusts.>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/loner/poet/romantic/snark:Dashed against the rocks. See how <bookish.mf:his/her/their> legs are broken? Managed to drag <bookish.mf:him/her/them>self a [i]little[] ways./Legs are... yeah.

~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hero2=<hero2.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead:But, then... should we be worried? Weren't supposed to be Drauven in these parts, I thought./[face:default]Raises the question, though. Think there's more of the pesksome buzzards soaring these skies?/Guess what I'm wondering most is whether there's more of them. Whether we should take this as a warning./[face:default]But, then, we should probably be on guard, huh? Where there's one, there's... some others. That's a saying I've probably heard.>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_bookish=Hm.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_bookish=<hero2.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead:Actually, I think this [i]confirms[] that there aren't./Actually, I think this [i]confirms[] there aren't./Actually, think it's the opposite./Actually, think it's the opposite.>
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_bookish=Think... if there [i]were[] others, this one would've been found.
~01~prompt~panel_015~4_hero2=<hero2.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead:[face:interested]And, so... they wouldn't have left <bookish.mf:him/her/them> behind, you're saying?/[face:interested]Could've found <bookish.mf:him/her/them> and left <bookish.mf:him/her/them>?/Could've been too much effort to carry it back./[face:default]Who knows? Could've found it and left it.>
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/loner/poet/romantic/snark:Flight... it's not an honor they bestow on just any of their soldiers. The wingknights are revered, dreaded, glorified. Would we leave one of [i]our[] most storied heroes to rot on a hilltop, simply to avoid an inconvenience?/I've noticed it before, how they gather their dead. Even the bodies of the footsoldiers will disappear if left for a day or two. Doubt they'd abandon a [i]wingknight.[]/We all have ways to honor our fallen. If they couldn't bear the body away, they would've performed the funeral rites here. Wouldn't leave <bookish.mf:him/her/them> like [i]this.[] One of their Wingknights./Those who are granted wings... they're considered [i]special[], aren't they? Doubt they'd just leave <bookish.mf:him/her/them> here to... well. It's a pretty universal custom, I think. Honoring your dead. /[face:skeptical]One of their [i]winged knights[]? I don't have scales and a lizardnose, maybe, but I [i]do[] know Drauven are big on things like rank. And honor, and all that stuff. Even their worst flier wouldn't be denied a hero's rites.>

~01~prompt~panel_018~3_narration=It's in a moment of quiet that the dirt at their feet begins to swirl.

~01~prompt~panel_020~1_narration=It's a short but powerful gust, whipping and wailing among the peakstones.
~01~prompt~panel_020~3_actionSmall=[navy]...rattle...\n   ...rattle...
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_narration=And then, abruptly, it dies down. They rub away the dust that covers their eyes and look around.

~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~3_narration=They lay the bones, the wings, and the armorscraps \nin a ring of rocks, douse them with a little oil.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~4_narration=It doesn't take long for the flames to do their work.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~3_narration=Afterwards, they return the way they came. \nReaching the trailwarden's camp by nightfall.
