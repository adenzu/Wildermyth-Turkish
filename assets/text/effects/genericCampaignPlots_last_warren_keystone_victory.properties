~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Winds eddy and abate. An owl muses in the pines.
~01~~panel_004~3_npc=[light]<hero2.exists:Wayfarers./Wanderer.> Don't shrink from me. I'm an ally.
~01~~panel_005~3_npc=<hero.themePiece_wolf_head:[light]I heard your call and came. My fur's all damp. Am I allowed [i]in?[][face:grim]/[light]I'm, yes, it's my house. \nMy fur's damp.>
~01~~panel_005~4_hero=<hero.themePiece_wolf_head:Your scent, <npc.lastname>. It's all around your house. \nGood to finally meet you. Face to face.[face:grim]/You're the—>
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=<hero2.exists:They transplant/<hero> tranplants> a few coals inside.
~01~~panel_006~2_narration=<npc.fullname>—for that's who <npc.mf:he is/she is/they are>—shares some of <npc.mf:his/her/their> story. Fills <npc.mf:his/her/their> belly, savoring a small complement of pork-rust with <npc.mf:his/her/their> stewed corn.
~01~~panel_006~3_npc=[light]I climbed in those burrowlines, and they went \nforever. And I saw this great god tunneling.
~01~~panel_007~3_npc=[light]A digging god. Its way is to move through the earth, never breaking stride.
~01~~panel_007~4_hero=A god, you'd call it? Can <hero2.exists:we/I> fight a god?
~01~~panel_008~1_npc=[light]To the bone-and-metal ones, this is a god, and maybe even to those who made it.
~01~~panel_008~2_action=[tan]CrUNKle!!
~01~~panel_008~3_action=[gray]SMRASHH!!
~01~~panel_009~4_hero=<hero2.exists:[small]<hero.bookish/healer/hothead/leader/loner/60:Intentions have [i]inertia.[] If it intends to destroy us, we must match the force of that intent./Right, well, any decision we make here doesn't have to be final./[face:talking]Hesitation's riskiest of all, in a fight./Doesn't make sense to decide anything here and now. Not until we [i]can[] act./When a bear decides you're food...[face:neutral]\nyou have to kill the bear. \n/And, well, [i]I'm[] wondering if it's even...[face:skeptical]>/>
~01~~panel_009~5_hero2=<hero2.exists:<hero2.personality:[face:interested]Never breaking [i]stride?[] Must've been astonishing to see. I wonder if there's a way around outright wrecking it.../[face:interested]I... hm. I just worry... if we [i]can[] break it... is that a [i]good[] idea?/Well I don't want to [i]break it![] Sounds like something I'm meant to [i]ride.[][face:joy]/It sounds pretty impressive. Wonder if we could maybe... find some way to even redirect it? Repurpose it? [i]Use[] it?[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]I find the idea of dismantling anyone's god... to be at least somewhat [i]troubling,[] right?/I'm not [i]scared. []Something about this is weird, though. Weird battle to have./Gives me pause, actually. We should be careful. Anything called a god has a reason for being here./[face:grim]Sounds almost like a wild thing./Gods. Hm. Gods, I think, might have hidden influences. On the greater sum of existence.[face:grim]/[face:interested]I kind of... wouldn't want to, um... I mean, what if—twist!—the god is actually our friend?/We'll wreck the thing, and then find out it was keeping the whole planet from sinking.>/>

I don't care./[face:skeptical]I don't really care./[face:dubious]Are we really getting conflicted over a big bonedrill, now?/[face:neutral]Necessity dictates our path, a lot of the time.>>/>
~01~~panel_009~7_hero=<hero2.exists:/If it was [i]made...[] I guess it can be unmade?>
~01~~panel_010~3_npc=[light]I don't believe the [i]god[] is what needs destroying.\nRather, I'd target the <threat.cdgmt:one who/being who/being who/[i]Matron.[] The [i]mind[] who/being who> dominated it.
~01~~panel_011~4_hero=<threat.cdgmt:Someone/Someone/Someone/Someone/Someone> you [i]saw?[] <hero.coward/goofball/healer/loner/poet/romantic/60:[face:interested]You're saying it's worse than gods?/[face:skeptical]What do you mean?/[face:neutral]It's okay, you can tell us all of it./Say what you mean./[face:neutral]What do you mean?/What do you mean?[face:neutral]/What, exactly, are you referring to?>
~01~~panel_012~3_npc=[light]I glimpsed <threat.cdgmt:them/it/it/it/it>, then. Just in the dark. But I see <threat.cdgmt:them/it/it/it/it> in my dreams, now...
~01~~panel_013~1_npc=[light]...in my dreams, <threat.cdgmt:always, a placid face blankly watches me. Under a crown. Gazes agelessly. And finally disappears among the hulks of bulls./spreading great wings, it leers. I feel the force of its presence even in nightmares. The fear it breathes into me. Drauven stand glaring by its knees.../this many-tendrilled face. It whirls blades, turns flesh to glass. In my dreams... it's never far./waiting at the bottom of the pit of my sleep... something clanging. Hungry. Burning and [i]old.[]/it's there. The [i]Maylen.[] Tall and feelingless. And the droning voices sing... and drive you almost mad...>
~01~~panel_014~3_npc=[light]<threat.cdgmt:They are the one/That is the monster/That is the monster/That is the will/That is the monster> at the center of all our troubles. Torturing our land, our people. For generations now, I've come to believe.
~01~~panel_014~5_hero=<threat.cdgmt:The Deepist ruler. The voice under all their wretchery, that echoes up from the darkness./[face:skeptical]Sounds like a Dragon, the way you say it./Gorgon. A great Gorgon, maybe, with a power beyond the others? The power to command a god? It's not without precedent, if you know your various fictions./The Morthagi have always seemed... [i]universally[] led. United. Orchestrated./It fits the pattern well. With Thrixl, I mean. Toying with whatever's not theirs. And directing it to their ends.>
~01~~panel_015~3_npc=[light]<threat.cdgmt:They're who/That is what/That is what/That is what/That is what> we must overthrow.
~01~~panel_015~6_hero2=<hero2.exists:Are you a fighter?/>
~01~~panel_015~7_hero=<hero2.exists:/Are you a fighter?>
~01~~panel_016~3_npc=[light]Not much of one. Not after my back break, my <season> wounds. But my nose is sharp, my ears too. I believe we can catch them: the great digger god, and its master.
~01~~panel_017~1_narration=<hero2.exists:They depart/<hero> departs> in another day.
