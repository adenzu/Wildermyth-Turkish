~01~~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.hometown> cleaned up the old <hero.goofball/romantic/greedy/healer/leader:stewhouse/dance hall/trading post/inn/bakery> and renamed it "<hero>'s".
~01~~panel_001~2_hero=<hero.personality:[face:happy]<hero.goofball/romantic/greedy/healer/leader:As a taster of boilpots, and house-soups, and the good old thick-n-browns stirred all this world over... I can confidently say these stewers are masters of the craft./Starting learning the [i]Toadwife Hop[] last week. Disarmingly cute, and yet alarmingly complex.[face:interested]/Was always a captivating place to browse. Did you know all our tangroot comes from one little swamp in the south?[face:talking]/They say you'll learn more in the common room of a busy inn than you will in the dusty corners of a library. I disagree, of course. I [i]must,[] right? But that's what inspired me to [i]combine[] the two.[face:skeptical]/[face:talking]I've been perfecting my pastries, meticulously, over a span of six seasons. Next I'll be attempting the dreaded [i]Plum Bun.>/[face:interested]But now people're... people're going to blame [i]me.[] Right? When it's not how it used to be? "Ever since it became [i]'<hero>'s,'"[] they'll say.../[face:talking]I told them to put my name on something more fitting. You know, like <hero.whm:a... say a spiky, iron-walled arena? Full of gladiatorious gladiators? All gladiating?/a woodsy outpost? Pepper it with arrows? Make it look all... [i]forest-rogue,[] you know?/a [i]wizard's[] tower? Cloud-reaching, and all crammed with wizardstuff?> But... we didn't know where to find one, so...[face:interested]/Banners are nice. Don't they get [i]dirty,[] though? Aside from that, it's...\nWell, but it feel like they could've made the [i]sign[] bigger, right...?[face:skeptical]/[face:happy]It's really [i]more[] than I would've wanted, but... it's kind.\nI'll enjoy it, and be grateful./[face:skeptical]Don't know. Doesn't it feel kind of like...? Feels like \nI'm being [i]mocked.[] Or even [i]challenged./I would never have asked for this, but... I'm honored. I'm [i]touched.[][face:interested]\nShould I do what I can to... help promote the place? I definitely [i]should.[]/[face:skeptical]Is there some [i]other[] <hero>? [small][i]Has[] to be./[face:interested]I think of the times <hero.goofball/romantic/greedy/healer/leader:we swallowed cold meals. Little scraped out camps in the bracken./our feet were too sore for anything but marching./we couldn't find a store, a merchant, when we needed any small thing./we went bedless. A whole winter and spring./we wandered breadless. Picking at plants, rooting, mashing and stewing the meat of nuts.> And so I feel almost like I'm being consoled. Consoled across time, yes. A younger me is happier for this.[face:neutral]/[face:interested]It's funny, I never considered such a thing would...\nI mean it's... I guess it's nice that they think of me./[face:neutral]They must want it to [i]fail,[] huh?>
