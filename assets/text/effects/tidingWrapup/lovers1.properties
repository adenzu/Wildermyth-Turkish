~01~~panel_001~2_narration=There were days <hero> and <lover> felt far apart. During small errands. Or when they got to dwelling in distances remembered.

~01~~panel_001~5_lover=<random:Someone in town was selling pearls./Poppies are blooming by the stream./I let a big trout go. <lover.greedy.60:Again. I don't even know why. Going soft, I guess./I'm sorry. It was too beautiful to eat.>/There're melon-sellers in town. Hundreds of melons./The graves are getting overgrown. But I let them be. Should I have?/The mountains miss you. The birds and the lake./There's nine types of knife, apparently. Someone was telling me. You okay?/Sold it, finally. The old bed. They'll come by today./Brought you back a strawberry box. And I got these overtall candles.>
