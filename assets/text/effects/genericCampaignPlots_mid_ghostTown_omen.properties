Just know that \n    when the moon is a kernel of cold bleached corn/...and it chills me even speaking the tale out loud. But it's only truth I tell tonight.

Just remember \n    that when a moon rises, the color of a dying field/...and it doesn't matter to me whether you take it for truth or fiction. The moon is real enough.

But trust one thing I tell you: when the moon is yellow, like the too-soon bite you take from a plum/...and maybe there's cause to think I embellish my words. But trust this story, here, if you trust no other. When the moon is beerfoam gold>...
