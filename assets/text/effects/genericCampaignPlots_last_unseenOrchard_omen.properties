~01~~panel_001~2_folk1=<randomA:I'll purse my mouth if you've \nseen another tree like it!/Tickles me in the teeth! No one's \ngot a tree like this one![face:joy]/Argue me all day! Can't convince me \nyou've seen a prettier birdsperch!/Take my ciderpouch, if you can prove \nme wrong! This tree's one of a kind!>
~01~~panel_001~3_folk3=[small]<randomA:[i]Have[] you, <npc.mf:Father/Mother/Elder> <npc.lastname>?/[i]Do[] they? <npc.mf:Father/Mother/Elder> <npc.lastname>?/A tree, <folk1.mf:he means/she means/they mean>, <npc.mf:Father/Mother/Elder> <npc.lastname>./It is, isn't it? <npc.mf:Father/Mother/Elder> <npc.lastname>?>
~01~~panel_002~4_npc=<randomA:Well, I'm quite old. There's a lot I've forgotten.../I'm not everyone's acquaintance, of course. But.../I know what a birdsperch is, <folk3>./What's that, <folk3>? Yeah, I... well.>
~01~~panel_003~5_folk3=<randomA:[face:happy]So you [i]haven't.[]/[face:happy]I [i]knew[] it./Mm. Sorry./[face:happy]You're not sure? \nThat means it is!>
~01~~panel_004~3_folk3=Mm. Knee-high. Delicate little redleaf thing. \nI'm who spotted it, but <folk1> here...
~01~~panel_004~4_npc=It was just growing in the heights?
~01~~panel_004~5_folk1=I removed it. Mostly tended it, too, seeing as <folk3> was [i]scared[] of it!
~01~~panel_005~4_folk3=No Iâ€”! Only at [i]first.[] When, I thought it... \n[small]When I thought it was [i]whispering...[]
~01~~panel_005~5_folk2=You have to be careful, though. Bringing in wildborn plants.
~01~~panel_006~5_folk2=<randomB:Not just that they'll overly self-propagate, but.../For instance,[face:skeptical] did you check the [i]roots?[]/They can overspread in a season, in the right conditions.../Certain trees, be it their bark, their leaves, their roots...>
~01~~panel_006~6_npc=[small]<randomB:Right. Sometimes they'll carry infestations. Insects, diseases.../Yeah. For molds, blights. That stuff can ruin your soil.../Yeah, for a healthy woodland, there's good trees and bad.\nEven I have trouble distinguishing. With a new breed. /That's actually right. You don't know what [i]feeds[] on it, or calls it home. \nWhat pests or vermin you might be inviting into your garden.>
~01~~panel_006~7_folk3=<randomB:Our tree's not [i]infested.[]/ Look how big it is! There's obviously nothing [i]wrong[] with it.../Well our tree's obviously good.[face:grim] Look at it./[face:grim]Nothing [i]eats[] it. Even the thought... just sounds disrespectful.>
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=<season-2> wasn't when the nightmares took root. It was the season they sprouted.
~01~~panel_007~5_folk2=[small]Had to've grown awful quick, huh?
~01~~panel_007~6_npc=[small]Quicker than a western bluebark. Or any other weedwillow...
~01~~panel_008~2_folk1=It's okay, <folk3>. They're old. \nSo they say things.
~01~~panel_009~4_folk1=We're sorry.
~01~~panel_009~5_folk3=[small]Mm. Sorry.
~01~~panel_009~6_action=[orange]...rustle..
~01~~panel_010~6_speech=[purple][large]It's okay. You're doing your best!
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=The <season-2> ambles by. Becomes <season-1>, and finally <season>.
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=Far away, in <town>, a stranger drinks a barrelsweight. Just water. <folk2.mf:He has/She has/They have> earthquake eyes.
~01~~panel_012~2_speech=That's how it all began. \nWith that one awful tree.
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=The traveler isn't the first to share rumor of such things. \nBut <npc2.mf:he is/she is/they are> the first to have seen them with <npc2.mf:his/her/their> own eyes.
~01~~panel_014~4_npc2=Soon, there were many more of them. More trees. More [i]tenders.[] Folks who only... only wished to nurture... these orchards. Abandoning their lives to do so.
~01~~panel_015~5_npc2=The whole beautiful reclude... It all fell into reek and rubble. Even <npc.mf:Father/Mother/Elder> <npc.lastname>...
~01~~panel_016~6_npc=<npc2>! <npc2>, misty fool! It's ancient here,\nand they'll [i]grow![] They'll grow wonderfully...
~01~~panel_017~5_npc2=I... well I left <npc.mf:him/her/them>. I [i]had to.[]
~01~~panel_017~6_hero2=Where's this... <npc.mf:Father/Mother/Elder> <npc.lastname>?\nWhere <npc.mf:is he/is she/are they> now?
~01~~panel_018~5_npc2=<npc.mf:He/She/They> insisted we bring a few saplings abroad, when we escaped. To study them, <npc.mf:he/she/they> said. To understand them. We went to a ruin. A safe place. And...
~01~~panel_019~2_hero=[i]"A web is something they cannot see, \nthat traps them who trust it cannot be."[]
~01~~panel_019~3_hero2=<hero2.pcfn.hero:<hero>? Stop it./<hero.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>, please.../<hero>, please.../<hero.rfln.hero2:Please. <hero>.../Please. <hero>.../Love, please.../Please. <hero>...>>
~01~~panel_020~3_hero2=<hero.goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/snark/60:You read it [i]creepy,[] is what you did. But I agree. It's Thrixl./[face:grim]Well. At least we both agree. It's probably Thrixl./It's alright. I guess we both agree. It's probably Thrixl./It's Thrixl. I get it. But still...[face:grim]/<hero.themePiece_skeleton_head:I know, and I wish you'd save it for when you're alone.[face:grim]/[face:grim]Right. And you can just [i]say[] that.>/Yeah. Well. You could be a little less creepy about it.>
~01~~panel_020~4_hero=<hero.goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/snark/60:[face:happy]<npc3.fullname> wrote it. I just read it./[face:talking]Don't blame me. <npc3.fullname> wrote it./Sorry. It's just a passage I recently found./[face:skeptical]<hero.themePiece_skeleton_head:Huh? What? I'm reading from my skeleton book./Don't be a cluft-head. You know it must be Thrixl, right?>/[face:skeptical]What? <hero.themePiece_skeleton_head:I'm reading from my skeleton book./You also think it's a Thrixl thing, right?>/I'm saying it's Thrixl. Again.>
~01~~panel_021~5_npc2=Please. Help <npc.mf:him/her/them>. <npc.mf:Father/Mother/Elder> <npc.lastname> built the treekeeping reclude. \nWith <npc.mf:his/her/their> <npc4.mf:father/mother/parent>, and welcomed us orphans...
~01~~panel_022~1_narration=It's not an unexpected request. Maybe not even unwelcome.
~01~~panel_023~1_narration=For almost half a year, they've slept with a steady sense of threat. \nSomething hunched on their chests: a heavy, clinging, staring beast.
~01~~panel_023~2_hero3=Across the world again...
~01~~panel_023~3_hero=Hard set of feelings it brings up. These days.
