~01~~panel_002~4_npc=And here are [i]you.[] A <hero.whm:warrior/hunter/mystic> of renown.
~01~~panel_003~1_hero=<hero.coward/greedy/loner/snark/60:Appreciate this springwater, thanks. How safe is it out here? Just you?/Whose herd is that? Do you breed them, sell them[face:talking]?//[face:dubious]No one told [i]me[] about this Bat Castle./[face:talking]Appreciate this springwater, thanks. Live out here by yourself?>
~01~~panel_003~2_hero=<hero.coward/greedy/loner/snark/60://[face:neutral]Hopefully this doesn't take too long.//>
~01~~panel_003~3_npc=<hero.coward/greedy/loner/snark/60:Just me is enough. I have been out here a long time./Myra is their leader. The golden muse-ox. They belong to themselves./Silence does not always hide a wandering mind, you know?/No. They do not know you./A <npc.mf:man/woman/person> in the wilds is never by <npc.mf:himself/herself/themself>.>
~01~~panel_004~1_hero=<hero.coward/greedy/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]You... [i]have?[] You seem young. Or... I thought you seemed young./[face:skeptical]Oh. Well, appreciate you letting me \nuse your spring. I [i]owe[] you at all?/I'm listening to you,[face:grim] aren't I? What do you want?\nAnyway, thanks for letting me use your spring./Y...yeah, sorry. [face:skeptical]Thanks for letting me use your spring, though./[face:neutral]That seems like a choice you make.>
~01~~panel_004~4_npc=<hero.coward/greedy/loner/snark/60:Seeming is unimportant. But regardless, I'm never truly alone./You worry for your nest, don't you? It's as if you never \nleave it. The wind is mellifluous, the sky is free./I want you to [i]hear[] me. Hear [i]them.[] The spirits./The spirits, I mean./Then you are misled. The spirits live all around us.>
~01~~panel_005~1_hero=<hero.coward/greedy/loner/snark/60:/[face:neutral]/[face:skeptical]/[face:dubious]/>
~01~~panel_005~3_npc=<hero.coward/greedy/loner/snark/60:Spirits live here. And everywhere. I am their friend. They are who told me of the castle's return./The spirits of this world will provide for you. And in fact, [i]they[] are who told me of the castle's return./They are who told me of the castle's return./They are who told me of the castle's return./And in fact, [i]they[] are who told me of the castle's return.>
~01~~panel_006~3_npc=The Black Castle was once the home of a wise and powerful <npc2.mf:Sorcerer/Sorceress/Sorcerer>. <npc2.mf:He was a King, but he did not let himself/She was a queen, but she did not let herself/They were a monarch, but they did not let themself> be called that. <npc2.mf:His/Her/Their> people loved <npc2.mf:him/her/them>.

~01~~panel_008~2_npc=<npc2.mf:King/Queen/Great> <npc2>.
~01~~panel_009~3_npc=One day, a mighty creature of yore—some say a Dragon—noticed <npc2.mf:King/Queen/Great> <npc2>'s beautiful castle and swore to make it his. To save <npc2.mf:his/her/their> people from war, <npc2.mf:the King/the Queen/<npc2>> made a deal with a stone spirit. And they disappeared into the mountains, castle and all.
~01~~panel_009~5_hero=[small]The whole...? Hm.
~01~~panel_010~1_hero=That the castle returned, <npc.mf:he/she/they> said, was a bad sign. The spirits... they apparently [i]told <npc.mf:him/her/them>[] that the castle hadn't intended to come back.
~01~~panel_010~2_hero3=[small][i]Intended...[]<hero3.coward/goofball/poet/romantic/60:[face:interested]?/[face:happy]  neat.../[face:neutral] mm./[face:interested] yeah.../?>
~01~~panel_010~3_hero2=Does it have something to do with the <foes.cdgmt:<season-1> disappearances? \nThe surge in Deepist meddlers and marauders?/Drauven surge? \n<season> seems to be lizard-season, suddenly./Gorgon activity \npicking up again? This past <season-1>?/Morthagi problems \nwe're starting to get again? Since <season-1>?/Thrixl suddenly\njust like, [i]quilting[] our hills this past <season-1>?>
~01~~panel_011~1_hero=Said <npc.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> know soon. [face:grim]And that I should bring what force I could. 'Course, I knew exactly what force that would mean...
~01~~panel_011~3_hero2=Means us.
~01~~panel_012~1_hero=<hero.pcfn.hero2:Yes, my <hero2.mf:boy/girl/child>./Yes, <hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>./Right./Right.> Which is what I knew exactly.
~01~~panel_012~3_hero2=<hero.rfln.hero2:[face:skeptical]Well, okay. Not [i]my[] fault \nyou're bad at explaining./[i]Oh.[] Yeah. Sorry. You wanted it \nto be... Nevermind.[face:neutral]/[face:happy]You love me. Remember./[i]Oh.[] I see what you were doing.[face:neutral]>
~01~~panel_013~2_hero3=[small]All because you had to fill up your water jug, huh?
~01~~panel_013~4_narration=They'll set out the next morning, to find Sage <npc>'s distant cottage.
