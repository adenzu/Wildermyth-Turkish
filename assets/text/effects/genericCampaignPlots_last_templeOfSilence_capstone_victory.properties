~01~~panel_001~1_narration=There's no sound as walls buckle, as slabs of ceiling drop, and displaced chunks of floor thrust up.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=<hero2.exists:They must/<hero.mf:he must/she must/they must>> run or be buried in the collapse.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Even as the earth rends the temple in its sandy knuckles, as it fills the tunnel with granite and grit, and sinks the land under which the Gorgon hallow lay hidden...

~01~~panel_005~1_hero=Oh.
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=A ripple of breeze clitters in the gravel. Insects honk and rasp and hum.
~01~~panel_006~4_hero2=<hero2.exists:<hero3.exists:Right. We're saying stuff. Out loud./I'm saying stuff. Out loud.>/>
~01~~panel_006~5_hero3=<hero3.exists:Can... can we talk? We're talking, I guess./>
~01~~panel_007~3_hero=Oh!
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=<deadHero.exists:<deadHero.2.exists:Dear lives were/A dear life was> given, today. To slit the sack of silence and pull the world loose. It's impossible not to smile, as a lost spectrum of sound fans out again./The thick silence is cut, and falls away. A lost spectrum of sound fans out, each tone and timbre dazzling in the ear.>

~01~~panel_010~2_narration=And though it will be a long time before the broken rhythm of the roaring years is trusted, and before peace can be enjoyed, without worry...
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=...that <season> of silence will be the worst these hills ever know.
~01~~panel_011~2_narration=The Gorgons have gone.
~01~~panel_011~3_narration=A generation, then, will grow and go \nto their graves not fearing the quiet.
