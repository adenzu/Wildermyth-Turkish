~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The spectral blaze spends no heat on them. It dances, blue and teasingly tepid.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=A faint breeze mutters in the leaves. The almost unbreathing wind \nof lethargy: of [i]fading[], without resistance, out of form and feeling.
~01~~panel_001~3_hero3=<hero3.exists:What a misery they've left here./>
~01~~panel_001~5_hero=<hero3.exists:/What a misery they've left here.>
~01~~panel_002~5_npc=A misery indeed. Where heat and joy once burned,\nwhere seed met energy, and began to be [i]life...[]\nnow there's just decay. It'll die and be barren, soon.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=It's one of those very sudden <npc.mf:men/women/people>. A shrinesage.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=Room is made for <npc.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~~panel_004~6_hero=You're who the locals call <npc>, Guided by Flames.
~01~~panel_004~7_npc=[i]Guarded[] by Flames, when I was young. And still not fit to guard them back, despite the body you see. The shrinecoal was stolen.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=<npc.mf:He explains/She explains/They explain> a little. That the Deepists defeated here were only an unlucky detail. The majority of the force returned to their cavernhold, with a hot ember taken from this site.
~01~~panel_005~8_npc=...laid here long ago in honor of some dead <npc.mf:Lord/Lady/Mage>. \nThe shrinecoal was the nascent home of our spirit Alo-o.
~01~~panel_006~9_npc=And the land was cold, then. Doomed. As you find it.
~01~~panel_007~5_hero=<hero4.exists:/Losing it, I guess the spirit must've been thrown afield? Homeless?[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_007~8_hero4=<hero4.exists:Losing it, I guess the spirit must've been thrown afield? Homeless? />
~01~~panel_008~9_hero=<hero.coward/goofball/greedy/romantic/snark/60:There must be a way to [i]un[]doom it?[face:interested]/[face:happy]Fortunate wrinkle here is... <hero2.exists:our specialty/<deadHero.exists:our... or [i]my[] specialty...[face:grim]/my specialty>> happens to be [i]un[]dooming things./[face:skeptical]Well... how much do you give <hero2.exists:us if we/me if I> [i]un[]doom it?/Doom never changed true love to indifference./All the best things're doomed, these days. Flowerbuds. Cubs and kittens. <hero2.exists:[i]Us.[]/[i]Me.[]>/[face:grim]I'd like to ask, then. How do we go about [i]un[]dooming it?>
~01~~panel_009~10_hero=<hero.genericPlots_volchasmSpiritseer:[face:neutral]I [i]met[] your spirit. Alo-o? <hero2.exists:We're/I'm> here doing her work. />I'm saying the task isn't too big for <hero2.exists:us/me>.
~01~~panel_009~11_npc=Well. That is bravery. If you hope to stop these diggists from what they do...
~01~~panel_010~11_npc=I shadowed them all the way to the Volcano's heart.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=So <hero2.exists:they'll/<hero> will> go searching, by <npc>'s direction, for the cavern where the sacred ember burns.
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=What they'll meet there is a <npc2.mf:King/Queen/Monarch>.
~01~~panel_012~2_narration=<npc2.mf:He's/She's/They're> of an age unguessable, an ambition unsurpassed.\nA crown on <npc2.mf:his/her/their> head, blinding bright.
