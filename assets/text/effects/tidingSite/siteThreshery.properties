~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The first harvest from the fields around <site> was a little... off.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=<foes.cdgmt:The grain was moldy, but cattle were drawn to it, and would break fences to move around the discarded piles and bellow in musical tones./The heads of the wheat looked almost like feathers, and the flour had a bitter taste./The stalks wouldn't grow straight, but twisted along the ground in a tangled mass./No one could pinpoint exactly what was wrong, but everyone agreed that the flour tasted "rusty."/Whoever ate that grain had the same dream. A dream of tunnels and the buzzing of ghosts.>
