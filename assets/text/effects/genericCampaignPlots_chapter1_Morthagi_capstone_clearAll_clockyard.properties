Those ancient Mortificers, screwing life-bulbs into the lifeless./[face:interested]You can feel it... the air's kind of... kind of [i]charged,[] right? Maybe we should hold off, for now? Make a plan?/[face:talking]Sounds like the work of an afternoon, to me. Come on./This whole land was laid over the corpse of their civilization, it seems like. Those ancient Mortificers, screwing life-bulbs into the lifeless./[face:grim]Call us cursebreakers, and remember how we look in this moment. I'm sure we'll return with a few new nicks and scars./Evil ruins is kind of the baseline of what we've come to expect.[face:neutral]/<bookish.goofball.60:[face:happy]/[face:talking]>What other kind of ruins are there?>
~01~~panel_003~3_npc=I'll see if I can collect some more help.
~01~~panel_003~4_ship=<ship.coward/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/60:[face:interested][small]More help'd be good./[small][face:skeptical]Little [i]late[] for that./[small]Kind of you.

Or not too many for us?/[face:talking]Sounds like a puppetshow. They making their skulls talk to each other?/If no one moves rashly, we can protect each other.//Remember why you fight. Remember everything you care about. Use it./Our names will be blesswords after today./Stick to what we know. <bookish>? <leader>? It's been working thus far.>/<ship.loner.60:<bookish>, uh... maybe [i]we[] should stay close to each other?[face:interested]/<bookish>, could you stay close to me? Just... in case?>/<ship.hothead/leader/60:Of [i]course[][face:skeptical] there is. Why're we pausing?/Let's all be on guard./<ship.coward.60:[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]>Anything else we can...
