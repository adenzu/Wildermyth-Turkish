~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hero=Battlelight fades. Noise shivers, dulls.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_hero=Cold invades <hero.mf:his/her/their> chest, <hero.mf:his/her/their> arms.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hero=But a huge warm presence is beside <hero.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hero=And the great bear is no stranger.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_hero=To a familiar nightscape, <hero> goes. Guided. A dark shape is there to follow over the wrinkled hills, the used-up hills, all moldy with moonlight.
~01~prompt~panel_004~5_hero=[light]Emruic.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=...is as hollow as these phantom woods.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=<hero.mf:His/Her/Their> voice when <hero.mf:he calls/she calls/they call> out that name...
~01~prompt~panel_005~7_hero=[light]Emruic...
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=<hero> catches up to the bear's careful strides, and <hero.mf:he/she/she> turns. \nWith a noise like a small sweeping wave on a calm coast.
~01~prompt~panel_006~8_action=[actionSmall][darkGray]...swolsh...
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hero=[light]<hero.phantomoftheRange_thisChapter:I didn't... didn't know this moment... \nwould come so [i]soon.[face:interested]/I... we went together... we saw a lot.>
~01~prompt~panel_011~9_hero=[light]What is there left to do, Emruic?
~01~prompt~panel_012~8_action=[gray][actionSmall]...brunff...
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_narration=Then <hero.mf:he/she/she> sinks. Down on <hero.mf:his/her/her> side.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_narration=Not like a dying thing, collapsing all at once, but like an old <hero.mf:man/woman/woman> setting <hero.mf:himself/herself/herself> on clean sheets. Gentle with <hero.mf:his/her/her> bones. To catch some much-needed rest.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_narration=And seems, suddenly, touchable. A being of fur, blood, muscle, and breath... whose breathing is all done.
~02~choice_defend~panel_001~1_narration=So <hero>, too, lies down.
~03~player_chose_defend~panel_001~1_hero=[light]<child.exists:<child>? Live well./<lover.exists:<lover>? Live well./Live well, friends.>> And win your battles.
~03~player_chose_defend~panel_001~3_narration=<hero> unshoulders <hero.mf:his/her/their> life like a wet cloak.
~03~player_chose_defend~panel_002~3_narration=Falls into the night earth.
~03~player_chose_defend~panel_003~1_narration=And there's an old invocation that goes like this:
~03~player_chose_defend~panel_004~1_narration=[white]\nMossybody walking, wander you to bed. \n  Sleep, by boulders brothered, until rain is in your hair.\n\n                       Dig in starless dreamlengths  \n                           Down from ranges you once ruled;\n            \n                         Forest the cold slopes in your chest, and fern \n                                   the rifts your blood has fled.\n                         \n When a crow cleans your bones, the wind will knock them down.\n       Free of teeth, and weight, and heat, teach death to every king.\n             \n[]
