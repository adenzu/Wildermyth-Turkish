~01~prompt~panel_001~2_npc=Our trail ends here.
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_hunter=Ends?
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_hunter=<hunter.bookish/coward/goofball/leader/loner/60:[face:talking]The ability to move by land and stream... hm. For how bulky the thing must be, I imagine the river would be a relief./[face:interested]Guess that's... sort of all we can do, isn't it?/[face:happy]Great! I'll break out the tackle box!/Alright, so we need to walk both shores, both ways. Though that spreads us... probably too thin, huh?/So what good was following it?/Not much we can do, then. Unless you know where it might surface?>
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_npc=Either it knows we're following, or it's just opting for what's comfortable. It went [i]in.[]
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_npc=<hunter.bookish/coward/goofball/leader/loner/60:[face:talking]Yes, and it's [i]faster[] in water. They're born to it.[hunter.face:neutral]/[face:grim]You sound [i]relieved.[] I guess that's smart. But yeah, we'll just give it a night.[hunter.face:sad]/[face:happy]Idiot. [hunter.face:happy]<warrior>, do we have a place to sleep?/[face:talking]The idea's sound, but you've also pointed out the flaw. None of us could survive such an encounter alone.[hunter.face:skeptical]/[hunter.face:skeptical]We've learned plenty. We know what path it'll take. Or at least one path. If it comes again, we might be able to intercept it.[face:talking]/[face:talking]A river is always returning. It's for homegoing.[hunter.face:interested]>
~01~prompt~panel_004~4_warrior=<hunter.bookish/coward/goofball/leader/loner/60:[face:skeptical]What happened? Did you guys [i]lose it?[]/[face:skeptical][i]What's[] being decided?/We turning around?/What're you talking about? We're all going to die?/[face:talking]Did you find something? It's getting dark./Hm? We heading home?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=A short while later...
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_mystic=<mystic.bookish/coward/healer/leader/poet/60:Your knowledge isn't small, <npc.mf:Master/Madam/Master> <npc>. Are you well-read, or well-[i]experienced[] in these things?/[face:interested]Aren't you... or I mean, I [i]do[] understand. But aren't you a little scared? <npc.mf:Master/Madam/Master> <npc>?/[face:talking]How're you [i]doing,[] <npc.mf:Master/Madam/Master> <npc>?/[face:talking]<npc.mf:Master/Madam/Master> <npc>, I'm not suggesting we give up. But we're in a weird position, now./The sound of flames and rains and waters... are so much more alike than I tend to notice./<mystic.hothead.60:[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]>You mad at us for slowing you down, <npc.mf:Master/Madam/Master> <npc>? [i]I[] would be.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_narration=The light finds unexpected corners in their thought-hardened faces.
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_npc=<mystic.bookish/coward/healer/leader/poet/60:Some of both. From texts, I've learned they came from the sea. Maybe still live there./For myself? What's there to lose, anymore? I'm worried for you <hero4.exists:lot/three>, is all./I've cried enough tears in my life. I'll leave such useless things to my doddering years./No, you're right. We're in danger, here, on the edge of the wild. I'm sorry./From the ocean they come, to the ocean they return. Who knows why?/No. No, I'm not mad. I'm grateful you came. But I'm glad you won't meet it.> Gorgons are ancient, malevolent beings. In my youth, I hunted one like this. Managed to get an arrow in her eye, but never finished her off.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_narration=Twelve on the outskirts of <town>, \nalong a snaking track...
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_npc=You saw what happened to my <npc2.mf:boy/girl/child>. And the others.
~01~prompt~panel_009~4_hunter=<hunter.greedy/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/>
~01~prompt~panel_010~4_warrior=Petrified. <warrior.bookish/coward/healer/hothead/poet/60:[face:interested]It's horrific, but also, it's really the [i]oddest[] thing to see. To try and comprehend./[face:sad]Imagining that fate for ourselves... I'm sorry to say, it does make my resolve flutter, a little./[face:grim]Well. But maybe there [i]is[] a cure. Hoping so isn't the worst way forward./[face:angry]A cowardly kill, I call it. A dirty way to end someone, without [i]beating[] them./Flesh to stone, eye to glass... and where does the soul go? Or is it trapped in there still, peering out?/It's a thing I never would've thought possible. Not like [i]that.[]>
~01~prompt~panel_010~5_mystic=<mystic.hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:angry]/[face:neutral]/[face:skeptical]/[face:sad]>
~01~prompt~panel_010~6_hunter=<hunter.hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:angry]/[face:neutral]/[face:skeptical]/[face:sad]>
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_npc=My <npc.mf:father/mother/parents> died that way. When I was twelve. Is what turned me into the <npc.mf:man/woman/person> you know. A monster-hunter. My true quarry... eludes me.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=The night has become slowly strange. Silence has snuck in. Blue-voiced birds, the furtive shuffling of fox and mouse... are absent. The noisiest thing is the river.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_action=[blue][actionSmall]...splush...
~01~prompt~panel_012~3_action=[darkBlue][actionSmall]...slish...
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hunter=All you taught us, <npc.mf:Master/Madam/Master> <npc>... <hunter.personality:[face:talking]Sorry for every argument. My pedantic side... didn't fully recognize the utter [i]gravity[] of your work, I now realize./I never realized how deadly it was. Your craft. Or I mean... I never really... tried hard enough to grasp it, maybe?/[face:skeptical]I know I've been a dirt-head student. I always [i]liked[] your lessons. I just didn't realize how... serious it all was, I guess?/[face:skeptical]it's useful knowledge and all, but it seems like there's stuff you've held back. And the longer we sit out here, the more I think about... well./[face:talking]We won't be helpless. We'll just need to be patient. And careful. And teach others, so what happened in <town>... won't repeat./[face:grim]it's [i]galling[] we can't finish what you came here for. That... vengeance... you deserve./Your efforts aren't wasted. I think we need more people, though.[face:talking]/and me, especially. [face:neutral]It's appreciated. It'll get used, even if it's not tonight./[face:talking]We may be examining our limits, by the firelight. But that's the first step in exceeding them./[face:grim]Thought we'd gotten pretty good. \nBut tonight, I just feel... weak./[face:skeptical]we should've been able to do more than step on your heels.>
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_npc=<mystic.bookish/coward/healer/leader/poet/60:[gray]They came from the sea, but...[] \nHey. You <hero4.exists:lot.../three.>/[gray]What's...?[] \nOh. I've made a mistake./I... made a mistake./<mystic>... was right. We shouldn't have come./[gray]To the ocean... []\nthey return./Hey, you <hero4.exists:lot.../three.>>
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_npc=Stay by the light. But run if you hear me shout.
~01~prompt~panel_014~3_action=[actionSmall]clink.
~01~prompt~panel_015~5_hunter=Well, wait...<hunter.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/60:[face:surprised]!/![face:surprised]/[face:angry]!/![face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:interested]>
~01~prompt~panel_015~6_mystic=<mystic.goofball/greedy/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:That's what [i]I[] say when I need to use the toilet.[face:happy]/Don't let that whiskey get hot./[face:dubious]Hate when <npc.mf:he takes/she takes/they take> that tone.../[face:grim]I don't [i]agree[] with that plan.../[face:neutral]So basically let <npc.mf:him/her/them> die, <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> saying./Don't let that whiskey get hot./>
~01~prompt~panel_016~6_warrior=Hm? Maybe it's just...
~01~prompt~panel_017~3_hunter=<hunter.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/60:[face:neutral]This's what we prepared for, isn't it?/[face:scared]I think it's really happening.../[face:interested]Does it seem like time to...?/[face:angry]Stubborn old...! Arm yourselves!/[face:grim]Let's be ready./[face:grim]Good chance we die tonight./Seems like we'd better arm ourselves.[face:skeptical]>
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_narration=A beast's agonized bellow rings out, followed swiftly by another.
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_mystic=<mystic.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/60:[face:surprised]/[face:surprised]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]>

~01~prompt~panel_018~4_action=[orange]GaRuuu!!
~01~prompt~panel_018~5_action=[darkRed]GaRuuu!!
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_narration=Hooves drum closer. Trunks shiver as bodies ram trees, uncaring.
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_narration=In that moment...
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=+ 0.6 Potency
~02~choice_one~panel_001~3_narration=...<mystic>'s natural \ngifts blossom in <mystic.mf:him/her/them>.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=+ 1 Health
~03~choice_two~panel_001~3_narration=...<warrior>'s fortitude turns \nto lasting iron.
~04~choice_three~panel_001~2_darken=+ 5 Stunt
~04~choice_three~panel_001~3_narration=...<hunter> sees life and death in a new way.
