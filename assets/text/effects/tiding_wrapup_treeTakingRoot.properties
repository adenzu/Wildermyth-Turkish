~01~~panel_003~1_narration=...<hero> took root <hero.personality:by the river. <hero.mf:He/She/They> spent a tree's allotment of years learning to read the watercourse. It unfurled forever-long brilliant laughs of crypticism./on the riverbank. Safe and warm. Plenty of water. Plenty of sunlight./[face:joy]by a busy river, where <hero.mf:he/she/they> could reach out to prank the passing boats./at the bend of a broad river. There, <hero.mf:he/she/they> liked to watch merchant boats forging upstream, drifting down./by a stream, where <hero.mf:he/she/they> could enjoy the company of local critters, and shelter them./by a river. And discovered then just how thirsty <hero.mf:he was/she was/they were>. For peace. For warmth. And safety.[face:neutral]/by a river. And there, for generations, <hero.mf:he would/she would/they would> be consulted by brave souls who ventured deep in the woods for wisdom./along a section of river far up in the mountains. A very deep peace dwelt in <hero.mf:him/her/them> then.[face:neutral]/at a sacred bend of the river. Fragrant and flooded with bee-humming light.[face:joy]/[face:happy]at a streamside. And lived delighting in the slow simple dramas of fish and frogs, birds and stars, sun and moon./by the river.>
