~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=The sun's fallen and a silver fog floats from the trees where shadows pool.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_ship=<ship.rfln.poet:[face:angry]<poet>, wait!/[face:talking]<poet>, stop for a second./<poet>? Can you slow down?/[face:interested]<poet.fullname>? That you?> <ship.bookish/hothead/leader/loner/60:Fog's getting denser. At this rate, we'll lose all ability to navigate./We're all getting lost in this stuff. It's thickening./Fog's getting thick. Important thing is to stick together./<hero3.exists:The others/<snark>> won't want to lose you./You able to see? I don't want to step in bear doings.>
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_poet=<poet.coward/goofball/romantic/snark/60:<poet.rfln.ship:[face:angry]Hey, cool it with the sneaking up on people! No one needs that!/[face:surprised]What have I said about sneaking up!? Unk. Almost lost my water./[face:scared]Ah!! You startled me! Come closer, <ship.mf:man/woman/<ship>>, I need you close right now./[face:surprised]Ah!! Do you always sneak up on people!? Especially in...>/[face:skeptical]What I call a [i]buttery[] mist. \nGlobs onto your face, doesn't it?/Perfect atmosphere, isn't it? Ever heard the story of O'Mitchell the Mountain Ghost? [face:happy]/[face:dubious]It's obnoxious being heroes, sometimes. Unnatural fogs and things. Pain in the ear./Can't remember a gloom quite like this.\nYou? Listen, the twilight birds are silent.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_narration=The quiet forms a fence around them. Impenetrable. The whirling air almost utterly opaque.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_ship=<ship.loner.80:[face:grim]Hm. Pretty odd./<ship.coward/healer/leader/60:[face:surprised]What if <hero3.exists:they/<snark>> can't find us?\n<snark>!?<hero3.exists: <hero3>!?/><hero2.exists: <hero2>!?/>/Now I'm worried. <snark>!?<hero3.exists: <hero3>!?/><hero2.exists: <hero2>!?/>/[face:angry]<snark>!?<hero3.exists: <hero3>!?/><hero2.exists: <hero2>!?/>/[face:skeptical]<snark>!?<hero3.exists: <hero3>!?/><hero2.exists: <hero2>!?/>>>
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_poet=<poet.rfln.ship:<ship.loner.80:That's all you have to say?/Quit barking.>/[face:skeptical]I think we need to... not stand here./[face:skeptical]You trust me, don't you?/[face:skeptical]I think we need to... not stand here.> Let's get to the trees. At least those're solid.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=They halt just inside the shelter of the pines. The dark air clinging wet. The trunks they press to dampen their palms.
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_poet=Hm.
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_ship=<ship.rfln.poet:[face:skeptical]Well, what now?/I don't like tree-clinging, generally./[face:grim]Being lost with you isn't [i]so[] bad./This isn't how I... I don't know. It's fine.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_narration=And then something vast moves beside them.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_narration=Slow, achingly slow.
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_ship=[gray]<ship.personality:Unimaginable.../[face:scared]Don't see us... Please.../My heart sounds like dogfeet...!/What's...?/You alright...? We're alright.../That's not... that can't be.../Be still. Be quiet./[face:interested]Huh.../It's... not.../I'd believe in anything now.../[face:happy]Ha... Wha...?>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_narration=It passes. Too enormous to be seen.
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_narration=Impossibly silent.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=Night's fallen.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_narration=The fog wanders away, clinging to the felty outline of that gargantuan shadow.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~3_ship=Let's find <hero3.exists:the others. Maybe they saw it too? Maybe they saw it better?/<snark>. Maybe <snark.mf:he/she/they> saw it too? Maybe saw it better?>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~3_poet=I'd rather us take a look now. \nTrails go cold quick in the dark.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_ship=<ship.rfln.poet:[face:dubious]<poet.bookish/coward/greedy/60:You can scour whatever you want to later. Group's fragmented./I shouldn't have to convince [i]you[] of all people./For once, can you just let something be?/Don't be stubborn, <poet>. For once?> Bad night to be chasing moonbeams./[face:grim]<poet.bookish/coward/greedy/60:I'll help you scour whatever you want. But let's do it <hero3.exists:with everyone/with <snark>>./Come on, <poet>. I know you understand the danger./Don't be stubborn./Don't be stubborn.> Bad night to be chasing moonbeams./[face:happy]<poet.bookish/coward/greedy/60:I know you're beyond intrigued.

I know you understand the danger./Don't be stubborn./Don't be stubborn.> Bad night to be chasing moonbeams./Bad night to be chasing moonbeams.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_narration=They meet in the open.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~3_snark=<ship>! <poet>!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~4_hero3=<hero3.exists:Wonder if [i]they[] saw it./>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_narration=Crickets crackle again, finding the rhythm. \nSomewhere, an owl pipes <poet.mf:his/her/her> blue notes.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~3_ship=We're here.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_narration=Apparently, <hero3.exists:all were/<snark> was also> able to glimpse the shadowy giant as it passed. <hero3.exists:None saw/Didn't see> more than a black suggestion of its form.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_narration=Then, as they're about to decide whether to set up camp or search \nfor huge tracks by starlight, a disturbance shakes the treeline.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_poet=<poet.rfln.ship:[face:skeptical]Come on, <ship>. <ship.bookish/coward/hothead/romantic/60:Where's that intellectual curiosity of yours?/Or are you really the coward they say you are?/Or do you just [i]act[] tough?/Aren't you supposed to be the hero?/Use your courage, if it's there.>/[face:talking]Come on, <ship>. <ship.bookish/coward/hothead/romantic/60:Where's that intellectual curiosity of yours?/The fog's gone. \nShould be safe enough./ Didn't think I'd have to convince [i]you[]./Who knows what we'll find? \nMaybe even a <ship.awm:mystically beautiful wildwoman/mystically handsome wildman>!/We won't go too far. \nStill within shouting range.>/[face:interested]We'll be safe. <ship.bookish/coward/hothead/romantic/60:Anyway, you're supposed\nto be the curious one.../Anyway, with the\nfog gone, we're in less danger, I think.../Anyway, didn't think [i]I'd[] have to convince [i]you[]./Anyway, who knows what we'll find?\nI want us to find it together./And we won't go too far. \nStill within shouting range.>/[face:skeptical]Come on, we won't go far. \nWithin shouting range.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~3_ship=<poet.coward.60:<poet.rfln.ship:[face:angry]Why do you think [i]you're[] \nbrave, all the sudden?/[face:interested]You're feeling brave today, huh?/[face:happy]You're being rather brave, \naren't you?/[face:skeptical]Pretty bold, isn't it?>/<poet.rfln.ship:<ship.greedy/leader/60:[face:skeptical]Remember, we both saw it at the same time... so if.../Fine, take the lead. But don't get careless again./[face:skeptical]Lead on, then. Lucky \nfor you, I'm here...>/<ship.greedy/leader/60:[face:skeptical]Remember, we both saw it at the same time... so if.../It's reckless, <poet>. But alright, I'll guard you./[face:skeptical]Lead on, then. Hope you don't mind if I stay ready...>/[face:interested]Alright then... together./<ship.greedy/leader/60:[face:skeptical]Remember, we both saw it at the same time... so if.../It's not what I'd advise. But alright, you're taking the lead./[face:skeptical]Lead on, then. Hope you don't mind if I stay ready...>>>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_poet=<poet.coward.60:<poet.rfln.ship:[face:dubious]Because I'm comparing myself to you./[face:skeptical]You saying I'm not brave normally?/[face:skeptical]You saying I'm not brave normally?/[face:interested]Is it? I guess so...>/<poet.rfln.ship:[face:grim]/[face:neutral]/[face:happy]/[face:neutral]>>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_narration=The night, emptied of silence, fills again with noise. Crickets and owls and scuttling ferrets.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~2_narration=Approximating where the giant had passed, they search.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~3_narration=There are no footprints.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_narration=Or are there?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~3_narration=Pools of green light are spaced along between the unbroken pine trunks. \nPerhaps at distances to match the thing's huge strides.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~3_narration=Even as they watch, the light-pools rapidly shrink into the ground. Drying, sinking. Perhaps just fading like starlight.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~2_narration=<poet> runs to stoop over one of these...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~3_narration=...and scrapes the earth away <poet.weaponType:with the edge of <poet.mf:his/her/their> sword/with the blade of <poet.mf:his/her/their> axe/with the head of <poet.mf:his/her/their> weapon/with the tip of <poet.mf:his/her/their> spear/with the strong limb of <poet.mf:his/her/their> bow/with the butt of <poet.mf:his/her/their> crossbow/with <poet.mf:his/her/their> daggerblade/with the head of <poet.mf:his/her/their> staff/with the tip of <poet.mf:his/her/their> wand/as best <poet.mf:he/she/they> can>.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~4_ship=Careful...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~5_action=[actionSmall]scritch, \n scratch
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~5_action=[blue]Rustle, rustle...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~2_narration=<poet.mf:He plucks/She plucks/They pluck> a glowing seed from the ground as it tries to burrow deeper.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~3_narration=It slips <poet.mf:his/her/their> grasp, but then floats, settling in the air...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_010~6_ship=<foes.cdgmt:Sounds like the mudsuckers are out tonight.../Drauven. Surrounding us, I'm sure.../Deer, boars, or worse out there.../Think there's bone-dogs on the prowl.../Think we've got some flies to swat...>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~2_narration=Snatching the seed, <poet> \nsecures it in <poet.mf:his/her/their> pocket.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~6_poet=This's shouting distance, right?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_012~4_ship=It's certainly worth a try...

~05~player_chose_two~panel_013~2_narration=<hero3.exists:Their friends find them./<snark> finds them.>
