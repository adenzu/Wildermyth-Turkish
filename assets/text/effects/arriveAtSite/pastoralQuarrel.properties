What would you grow?/[face:interested]Well, I mean. If we weren't fighting all the time. And, actually, we didn't [i]need[] to? If you had a bit of land, like this.

What kind of thing would you grow?/I mean, if there weren't any monsters around. You'd need another career, right? Say you had a piece of land like this. What kind of crops would you grow?/Supposing you were born in another place or time. If instead of trails and battle, your life consisted of ponderous hours tending your fields.

~01~prompt~panel_007~2_hero2=Hm.

Those're easy, right?/[face:happy]Oh, I know! Firepeppers. The kind that make your hair fall out!/[face:skeptical]There's a good market for figs, right? Might have to go with that./[face:happy]Leaning toward carrots. [i]Everybody[] likes carrots./Onions. Big juicy ones. Bet it'd be fun pulling them up./I'd stick to the staples. Wheat. Oats. Barley. Enough to keep a town fed./[face:grim]Mushrooms. Don't need a lot of tending. Obvious choice, really./[face:default]Have a fondness for olive trees, in all their gnarled majesty. \nWouldn't mind tending to a grove of my own./[face:happy]Might sound a little impractical, but I'd rather grow flowers than food.

~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hero=<hero2.personality:Mm. Artichokes./[face:default]Turnips? Think so./Heh. About what I'd expect from you./[face:default]Figs?

~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hero=<hero.personality:[face:happy]Cabbages would be [i]my[] specialty. By which I mean, I wouldn't simply [i]grow[] them. I'd cultivate a variety all of my own. Perfected over a span of generations./[face:interested]I'd go with... potatoes, probably? Something easy to make a meal out of./[face:joy]Me, I'd be a gourd<hero.mf:man/lady/person>. A gourdie. Grow all the funkiest \nshapes and flashiest colors./Me, I'd go all in on radishes. Speedy growers. Failproof. \nMake for a nice, steady income./Think [i]I'd[] go with cornfields. Versatile crop. Has a nice homey feel./For me, I always liked those little stick things. \nWhat do you call them? Asparagus...es?/[face:default]It'd be spinach for me. Makes your bones strong. \nGoes well with all kinds of things./j/[face:default]Rhubarb, for some reason, is what comes to [i]my[] mind. \nSomething about the color./For me, I like the picture of strawberry fields on a hot summer's day. Plucking and eating them right off the stem./[face:default]As for me... I'd plant a whole swath of garlic. \nSmelly enough to keep the pests away.>
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_hero2=<hero.personality:[face:happy]Get to name it, too. The [i]<hero> Crisp.[]/[face:skeptical]Mm. Boiled.

~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hero3=<hero3.personality:A rancher's life holds more appeal for me./Doesn't [i]have[] to be plants, right? Could raise sheep?/Plants are kind of dull, you know?

[i]Beetfarm[] just sounds good!/Apples, pears, apricots. Whatever grows best.[face:talking]/[face:grim]What? Just plant a bunch of pine trees, watch them grow./Only tasted it once, when I was young. Got it from a wandering woman, who came from faraway lands./Don't know the names. Just... all the things that fill a dish with flavor. And color.

~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hero3=<hero3.personality:Sheep, for instance. You know they're more intelligent than their reputation suggests? Far more interesting company than a field of vegetables./[face:interested]It's because... they're kind of cute? And I wouldn't have to kill them or anything. Just trim their wool every now and then./[face:happy]You know goats are nature's entertainers, right? Bet we could pull some big crowds. Me and my goat troop./[face:talking]Think about it. You start with a dozen hens. Each of them lays an egg a day. Let a few of those hatch, and... see where I'm going?/Put up a good strong fence to keep the foxes out. Let them wander about happily. Wouldn't eat them. Just take the eggs./[face:happy]You know, those real big [i]oinkers.[] The kind we saw in \n<town> a while ago?/Cows are good for a lot of things, not just meat and milk. There's hides. Wagon pulling. Even manure./Don't seem [i]too[] demanding. Just have to give them room to graze./[face:skeptical]Doesn't much matter whether it's cattle or ducks. Rabbits or sheep. But... actually, what [i]does[] a rabbit farm look like?/[face:happy]You know, a cattle wrangler. Or a gallant shearer. They'd come and perch on the fence just to watch me work./What can I say? I like a bit of tang in my cheese.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~2_hero3=<hero3.personality:Less labor as well. Give them land to graze, a couple of herding dogs to protect them... think I'd still have time for other, more [i]cerebral[] pursuits./[face:happy]Can you imagine? [i]Me[], a shepherd?[hero.face:skeptical]/[face:joy]Goatbuds, I'd call them. Watch them dance! Hear them sing! [hero.face:default]/[face:joy]It's like a goldmine, if you really think about it./Think it'd be a peaceful life./[face:interested]Ooo... [i]now[] I'm wishing I had a hunk of bacon./[face:default]It'd be a lot of work, but... feel I could be [i]useful[] at it./[face:interested]Could learn to spin my own wool. Be my own weaver. \n[small]Wouldn't need to hear about that old codger's grandkids every time I need a new shirt./In any case, I think that's where I'd find myself./[face:joy]By [i]they[] I mean my many rural admirers, of course./[hero.face:interested][face:happy]And if anyone gives me trouble... well, goats can be \nmean little critters, turns out.>

~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_hero3=<hero3.personality:Libraries, schools, even larger-scale workshops.

That sounds nice, doesn't it?/[face:talking]So, like. What if I built a giant maze? Not the boring kind. One with traps! And funny gags. Don't fall in the slimepit, kiddos! Watch out for the bonebeasts, grandpa!/[face:talking]Anyway, there's better ways to use a piece of land, if you've got brains. Why not open an inn? Roadgoers need a place to stop, don't they? Brew and stew to warm the innards. Could sell blankets. Or socks? Whatever they'll spend money on.../[face:interested]Well... I was thinking about what I could [i]build[]. A home for orphans or elders. People who'd otherwise be forgotten. Even if there weren't monsters, there'd still be disease. Misfortune. And people... I'd like to put my efforts into caring for [i]people[]./[face:talking]Yeah, because I'm thinking an obstacle course would be neat. Never enough space for one in my backyard, but [i]picture[] what I could do with a big old field like this. Draw the locals in, hold an annual contest. Need a prize for the winner. Prize would be.../[face:talking]Yeah, kind of. I think if I had a big enough piece of, call it farmland...\nI'd want to give it to someone who I knew would work it well. That's\nmaybe, yeah. What I'd do. And make myself useful, otherwheres./[face:neutral]And, anyway. If it was [i]really[] a strifeless world, I don't know. I think I'd \nfeel even [i]less[] inclined to stay put. To forge... connections./[face:talking]A farm is a practical thing, yes. Food's necessary. But I sometimes think... there're other necessary things we sometimes starve ourselves of, not knowing how to name them. What I'd do, if I had the means? An observatory. A place to ponder starshapes./[face:interested]Well, you know, it depends where the land was, but... what if I built a castle? Or, I mean, a really [i]grand[] house? And... I could have a restaurant too. Invite people. Get to know more about them. Maybe grow... [i]close.[] To one of them?/[face:skeptical]So. I'd make shoes or weave baskets. Build a very big shoe-place. Cobblerbarn. Or... a basket emporium. And. Is there trees on this land? I'd give lumberjacking a go. Basically, there's a [i]lot[] I'd be fine doing. If it meant I could avoid watching plants grow.>
