~01~prompt~panel_001~2_bookish=<bookish.coward/goofball/greedy/leader/60:[face:sad]Mill's not running? Doesn't bode well./[face:joke]Ever tell you the pranks me and Darcy Plinkton used to pull on the old <Hometown> miller?/[face:skeptical]Place might be abandoned. Could still be something we could use, though. Inside./[face:grim]Likely spot for trouble. Loose eyes. Stay alert./Place was in working order last <season>. Rumors are true. [i]Something's[] happened.>
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_leader=There's a way over. A little further on.
~01~prompt~panel_002~4_narration=They cross a sturdy bridge just downriver...
~01~prompt~panel_002~5_narration=...and approach their destination from behind.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_narration=The structure appears solid, but the waterwheel's clearly busted. A stack of cut wood shows no mossgrowth.
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_leader=<leader.rfln.bookish:<leader.bookish/coward/hothead/60:You realize it's still inhabited, right? Show some awareness and [i]arm yourself[], at least./[face:interested]I'm glad we put [i]you[] in front.../[face:angry]Look at you. Unready.

What do you think, love?/Ever think about a life like this? Maybe by a lake? I do.[face:interested]/[face:grim]Time flows like water, love. We all turn with it, until we break.[bookish.face:skeptical]/[face:happy]River reminds me of that time we borrowed a boat.../[face:talking]This place wouldn't be a bad little retreat, in safer times.>/[face:talking]<leader.healer/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Feel sorry for whoever owns the place.../[face:grim]I'd <bookish.weaponType:draw my blade/have my axe drawn/have my weapon off my back/have my spear off my back/ready my bow/ready my bow/ready my blade/have my staff out/ready my wand out/look ready for a fight> if I was you./[face:joke]Makes total sense for you to just wander up weaponless.../Weeds are cut in the garden \nback here...[face:skeptical]>>
~01~prompt~panel_003~5_bookish=<bookish.rfln.leader:[face:dubious]/[face:skeptical]//[face:interested]>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_npc=<leader.rfln.bookish:All's fine. This's my mill, travelers./All's fine. This's my mill, travelers./You folks out here hunting? I'm low on supply, myself./All's fine. This's my mill, travelers.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_narration=The millkeeper rounds the building with a newly filled jug.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_npc=<leader.rfln.bookish:You out here hunting, or what?/You out here hunting, or what?/Bad time to be in this neck of the woods./You out here hunting, or what?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~4_hothead=Hunting's one way to say it.
~01~prompt~panel_005~5_bookish=Had word of trouble with some of those bone-metal things.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_bookish=Right. <bookish.bookish/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/poet/snark/60:By those who've [i]studied[] them./[face:happy][i]That's[] the guys! Big skully grins on some of them./Apologies. You clearly know what's what./[face:grim][i]We[] certainly know that. Just wasn't sure you did./[face:grim]So you've got some experience, then./A lot of power in words. Morthagi, then./[face:dubious][i]Pardon[] me./But not everyone knows that.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_npc=[i]Morthagi's[] what they're called.
~01~prompt~panel_008~6_npc=Yeah, they did for my old waterwheel. Pulled all the iron workings. Methodical. So... but come inside. My arm's tired.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc=Morthagi first appeared, I don't know. A year? Maybe a year and a half, the first sighting? Never went out of their way to kill folks.
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_narration=The mill's stark: a half-gone flour bag slumped on the floor, mostly bare shelves. A lone book stands open to a page about the ancient Mortificers...
~01~prompt~panel_009~4_action=[orange][actionSmall]flint!\n  spark!
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_npc=But then folks started [i]getting in[] their way. Not on purpose. Just living their lives. Mark of the times, I suppose. Living as we always have is enough to get us killed or sent running. No remorse in those things. Morthagi, I mean. No remorse at all.
~01~prompt~panel_010~6_hothead=But you're still here...
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_bookish=<leader.rfln.bookish:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:interested]>
~01~prompt~panel_011~5_leader=<leader.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/loner/60:[face:skeptical]Likely they interpret the collateral effects of the folks living around here as interference.../[face:interested]I respect your courage. And I suppose you have a plan? You're going to thwart them, somehow, or...?/I understand why you wouldn't want to leave this place. It's a solid building, good spot. Could make it even better, I'm sure./[face:grim]You're brave to stay out here. And have you tried fighting back at all? Has anyone organized?/[face:grim]I get it. Got your own place, own living to look after. Hard to stay, but harder to leave./There're places you could go. <town>'s not that far off. Or... well, have you tried fighting? Not that I would suggest it, but...>
~01~prompt~panel_012~6_npc=I thought I'd learn about them. Bought the old book you see there. All it's shown me is...
~01~prompt~panel_013~6_npc=I'm in over my head. We all are. We're drowning out here, in a flood of old world terrors...
~01~prompt~panel_014~6_leader=<leader.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/loner/60:[face:interested]Vulnerability is often the most important lesson./[face:sad]Yeah, it's that way \nin a lot of places./[face:skeptical]Well, sure.../[face:sad]Right. It's bad in \na lot of places./[face:grim]Hm./[face:grim]Right.>
~01~prompt~panel_015~6_npc=I [i]am[] at the point of just... well, packing up and running, right? You folks look like you've seen some things. So why don't you tell me? Should I stay? Should any of us?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~7_bookish=<bookish.coward/goofball/60:[face:sad]It's tough... But <npc.mf:he/she/they>'d be better off leaving, right?/[face:skeptical]If I were you? I'd hit the road tomorrow./I hate to say it. You should go. Now. While you can.>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~8_leader=<leader.coward/goofball/loner/snark/60:[face:interested][i]We[] plan on fighting them. You might as well wait and see if we succeed.../[face:happy]Naw, you'll be alright! [i]We're[] here./Don't let them win. Not yet, anyway./[face:skeptical]We can knock a few bone-dogs over, if that's all it is. /Keep your home. Rebuild. You're under our protection, now.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~7_bookish=<bookish.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:skeptical]I think you have to be rational. These are deadly times. You know what they find downriver? Fish, yeah. But also [i]corpses[]./[face:interested]I'm fairly impressed you're still here. But you're wasting time now, aren't you? Yeah, we plan to fight them, but this place won't recover easily. Most have fled already.../[face:talking]And I totally understand the urge to dig in your heels, stick out your chin... but really, there's so much more to live for. This little dark river isn't worth floating in./[face:talking]And I understand, you don't want to lose everything. But your own skin's more precious than these beams and rocks. A big broken wheel./[face:skeptical]It's bad luck, really. Probably, in your shoes, I wouldn't want to leave. But every night you sleep here could be your last./[face:happy]And no, none of us wants to flee our well-worn paths, go out and see a stranger in every face. But sometimes, that's how the rest of our lives begin./[face:skeptical]And oh, sure, you'd be running away. You know who runs away? [i]Survivors[]. That's what [i]I've[] seen, anyway./Not that anyone here would force you, and not that we won't fight those things. But it's just not safe. It won't be. Not for a while, at least.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~3_narration=The next day, they see the millkeeper off, a handcart full of all <npc.mf:he/she/they> can carry.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~7_npc=Was born in this great place. My <npc.mf:brother/sister/sibling> and me. Guess I'll look for <npc.mf:him/her/them> in <town>.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~7_npc=Thanks. Thanks for telling me the truth. I think I'll be happy to start again, close to family. <npc.mf:He/She/They> married, my <npc.mf:brother Jankin/sister Yanna/sibling Yanna>. Two years ago. Married and might have a kid by now.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~10_leader=<leader.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/leader/romantic/60:[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:happy]/[face:happy]/[face:neutral]/[face:talking]/>Any luck, you can return here, someday.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~8_hothead=<hothead.bookish/coward/hothead/healer/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested]Perhaps you'll take up study? That book you've got isn't for the faint of heart, and it sounds like you parsed it alright./[face:interested]We wish we were going with you, trust me./We'll make sure the Morthagi don't go on crawling all over everything. That, we can promise./[face:happy]Takes courage to start over. And who knows? Once we've finished our work, these woods, this river, this [i]world[] might be safe again./Don't think you have to embrace town life. Build a little place on your own, on the outskirts, if you can./[face:talking]The seed of a new beginning takes root in the soil where we bury our old life. Yours may blossom into anything, still./[face:happy]Hey, who knows? I bet you'll meet a <npc.awm:lady/fellow> with long dark hair and sad eyes, and you'll tell <npc.awm:her/him> about this place, and bond over all you've lost./[face:skeptical]Sounds like a lot of work. But I guess [i]you're[] the one that's got to do it.../[face:happy]That's the spirit. Life's about what you can seize from it, however many times you're rebuffed.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~7_npc=I'm not sure I'll even wish to. Which is surprising to realize.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~7_npc=Well, I should say I've got things stashed under the floor. Was going to trade them for repairs, but... You're welcome to it. You'll earn it, if you're set on fighting those monsters. Good luck.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~3_narration=Indeed, once the millkeeper's gone, they find a cache of valuable materials beneath the floorboards.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_leader=Look, we'll take back these woods. This river. <leader.coward/greedy/hothead/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:skeptical]I'm not excited to face those things, but we've already seen nightmares. We've survived so far.<leader.greedy.60: Wouldn't say no to a crust or coinpiece./>/[face:talking]Kind of what we do these days. And afterwards, well, just remember who saved the place. Don't feel [i]indebted,[] but also... do./[face:angry]If there's no option but huddling up in town like beaten dogs, then all our people will die caged in together. We're here to fight.<leader.greedy.60: Wouldn't say no to a crust or coinpiece, if you want to help./>/People should be able to live alone out here. Anywhere, really, assuming they're competent enough. So...<leader.greedy.60: Wouldn't say no to a crust or coinpiece, if you want to help./>/[face:grim]There've been families along these banks as long as there's been music in the world. I think we have to fight for a place like that.<leader.greedy.60: Wouldn't say no to a crust or coinpiece, if you want to help./>/<leader.greedy.60:Wouldn't say no to a crust or coinpiece, if you want to help. But it's who we are, I guess I'd say./And no, it's nothing we expect payment for. It's who we've become.> We're the ones who show up just as sun goes down; we see the farflung and defenseless through, to dawn. [face:grim]/Or else we'll all die with big holes cut in us. If it's holes, then yeah, [i]that's[] when you get out of here. <leader.greedy.60: If it's not, then... wouldn't say no to a crust or coinpiece./>/Far as I'm concerned, you leaving would be a defeat. Set a terrible precedent at the very least.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_bookish=<bookish.rfln.leader:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:interested]>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~6_npc=<hothead.bookish/coward/snark/60:[face:interested]Well, but I.../[face:skeptical]That's... a kind of comfort...?/Pretty grim idea.[face:skeptical]/You're serious, huh?>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~7_leader=<leader.rfln.hothead:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:happy]/[face:interested]>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~7_hothead=<leader.rfln.hothead:Rarely hear it, but <leader.mf:he's/she's/<leader>'s> talking sense./<leader> and the rest of us have gotten through a lot./Anything <leader> says, we listen to./<leader.mf:He's/She's/<leader> there's> got it right.> <hothead.bookish/coward/snark/60:An emotional decision now could ruin you. Hold on a little longer./[face:interested]I wouldn't be here if I thought we'd lose. That's the truth./Whether we live or die can be your answer./Don't abandon everything. Not until you give us a chance to save it.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~8_leader=We're here to wipe them out, regardless. <leader.goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/60:[face:happy]/[face:talking]/[face:interested]/[face:grim]/>

~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_bookish=<leader.rfln.bookish:[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:interested]>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~3_npc=Well, the folks around here will certainly know your names. I'll stay. As long as I can. I look forward to telling the story, how you came here first, and how the light shone in your eyes as you left.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~10_npc=But I sure would like it if this story ends well. For all of us.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~11_leader=<bookish.rfln.leader:[face:dubious]/[face:happy]/[face:joy]/[face:interested]>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~9_bookish=<bookish.personality:[face:skeptical]Suppose it hardly matters, but that was a rare book. Nice if <npc.mf:he/she/they>'d offered it as a.../[face:interested]And now... we just have to pull this off, huh?/[face:joke]You hear that? We've got light-filled eyes. We must be doing real well!/[face:skeptical]Not to be [i]that[] <bookish.mf:guy/lady/person> but it would've been nice if <npc.mf:he/she/they>'d offered [i]any[] tangible reward./[face:happy]I wasn't sure, but I'm glad you convinced <npc.mf:him/her/them>. Feels good to be helpful, doesn't it?/[face:angry]Don't know about you, but I'm ready to stomp those scrap-sandwiches right [i]now[]./[face:happy]You did a nice job, <leader>. I'm kind of proud./[face:skeptical]Was hoping <npc.mf:he/she/they>'d vacate, actually. I could stand to own a quiet old place like that./[face:talking]There are times we draw close to an ideal. Heroism, I suppose it's called. Moments like these will echo, long after we die. Or do I sound boastful?/[face:happy]The light shining in our eyes, huh? We sound pretty heroic, these days./[face:joke]I always know when we get ascribed light-filled eyes: we did [i]something[] right.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~2_hothead=Shh. There's movement over by those trunks. Let's be on the alert.
