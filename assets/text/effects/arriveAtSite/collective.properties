~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=<company> had been pointed towards a cluster of tents in a wooded refuge south of <site>.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_npc=We were lucky to have a day’s notice that <foes.plural> were coming.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_npc=Better to have some tents and sacks of potatoes than just your nightshirt, at least.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_npc=Rest a while. Anything we can do to improve your chances in a fight, more likely it is we get to go back.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=So they do.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=Pigs forage around treetrunks.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_narration=People take turns stirring a pot.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_narration=Others chop logs, singing woodsy songs.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc4=How do you like your potatoes?
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_greedy=...Cooked?
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_romantic=Cooked is great.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_greedy=Don't take this the wrong way, but...
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_greedy=Everyone here is just so... wholesome.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_romantic=Don't feel like you have to earn our favor. We're here for the <foes.plural> either way.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_npc=Funny you should mention it, actually.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_npc=You should have seen <site> before this all happened. So much in-fighting. Standard family stuff about fences and fishing rights, but day in and day out...
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_npc=You try not to take sides, and it only makes everyone angrier.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_npc=I was ready to throw up my hands and leave them to chew each other's bones.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_npc=But suddenly, give everyone a common enemy, and it’s striking how quickly they come together.
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_greedy=You’re saying you want us to leave you some <foes.plural>?
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_npc=Not necessary.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_npc=I miss beds and wells and locked doors so much.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_npc=You know what a full-time job it is keeping these fat possums out of the food-sacks?
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_npc3=[i]Gerrah!
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_npc=I'm not getting excited yet, though. I've seen <site> with my own eyes.
~01~prompt~panel_022.(foes_Deepists)~1_speech=Even from afar, you can see the ruin. It’s as if anything built above-ground is offensive to them and they need to destroy it.
~01~prompt~panel_023.(foes_Drauven)~1_speech=Even from afar, you can see the ruin. When a band of Drauven want to destroy something, they make it very clear.
~01~prompt~panel_024.(foes_Gorgons)~1_speech=Even from afar, you can see the ruin. Those beasts have little left but destruction in their bodies.
~01~prompt~panel_025.(foes_Morthagi)~1_speech=Even from afar, you can see the ruin. The cursed things are so methodical about their destruction, too. Only makes it worse.
~01~prompt~panel_026.(foes_Thrixl)~1_speech=Even from afar, you can see the ruin. Roofs ripped apart with those jaws. Walls pocked with holes where they stash themselves. Disgusting.
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_greedy=Then scrap it.
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_greedy=Build a new <site.station>. What better excuse to start over?
~01~prompt~panel_029~2_romantic=And abandon what was?
~01~prompt~panel_030~1_romantic=When a place is lived in, it grows a spirit of its own. We don’t get to enjoy that these days, trekking around as we do.
~01~prompt~panel_031~1_greedy=You heard <npc>, it was squabble-stained anyway. Take advantage of the shake-up and build something better.
~01~prompt~panel_032~1_narration=Their discussion stretches through the afternoon, bringing arguments for both sides. But in the end, the people of <site> are convinced to...
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_romantic=...salvage the old site.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_greedy=...build a new one.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_romantic=What’s a “storied history” without stories, anyway? This is just one more for the collection.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_narration=After some passable potatoes...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_narration=<npc>'s talk turns to logistics.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_npc=There's a gully up that way that'll get you close. That’s how I got my best glimpse of the place.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_npc=If a wild-footed oaf like me can use it and not be noticed, it should serve you even better.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_romantic=Glad it hasn't rained lately.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~2_narration=The gully guides them true, deep enough to mask their approach.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_narration=<romantic> sees it first.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~2_romantic=<npc> wasn't exaggerating.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_narration=Debris hides signs of life, but <foes.cdgmt:hollow calls ride/barking calls ride/squelches and snorts ride/a metallic buzz rides/an ethereal hum rides> in on the smoke.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_greedy=<greedy.hothead/goofball/snark/60:You mean the three and a half beams that are still good?/You mean the three and a half beams that are still good?/You mean the three and a half beams that are still good?/Never underestimate "sentimental value," eh?>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~2_romantic=We'll save what we can.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_greedy=People love a fresh start. Everything shiny and new, nowhere to go but up.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_narration=After some passable potatoes...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_narration=<npc>'s talk turns to logistics.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_npc=There's a gully up that way that'll get you close. That’s how I got my best glimpse of the place.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_npc=If a wild-footed oaf like me can use it and not be noticed, it should serve you even better.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_greedy=Glad it hasn't rained lately.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_narration=The gully guides them true, deep enough to mask their approach.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_narration=<romantic> sees it first.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~2_greedy=<npc> wasn't exaggerating.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_narration=Debris hides signs of life, but <foes.cdgmt:hollow calls ride/barking calls ride/squelches and snorts ride/a metallic buzz rides/an ethereal hum rides> in on the smoke.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_greedy=At least we don't have to worry about <greedy.hothead/goofball/snark/60:trashing the place./trashing the place./trashing the place./doing further damage.>
