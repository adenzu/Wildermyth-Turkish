.blurb=We've arrived at <site>.
.longName=The Gone Ox
.name=Event
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=A weird rhythmic noise filters through the trees...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_coward=It's getting louder.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_healer=<healer.hothead/greedy/snark:So are you, I've noticed./It doesn't sound aggressive./Because we're getting closer...>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_leader=Over here!
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=Blood pools from its panting muzzle.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=An ancient Ox leans its bulk against a beech trunk.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_coward=<coward.healer.60:Early stages of the Gorgon sickness..?/The thing's sick or something.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_healer=The Ox doesn't flinch from <healer>'s approach. <healer.mf:He/She/They> notices a wound at the base of its neck.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_healer=There's something in there! A blue... what looks like a blue pomegranate seed. But it's as big as my fist...
~02~choice_operate~panel_001~1_participant=I've got skilled fingers. Let me try and dislodge the seed.
~02~choice_operate~panel_001~2_self=<participant.eventRoll:roll|difficulty>
~03~choice_execute~panel_001~1_leader=Better to kill it now. Let it die with dignity, an ox at the last.
~04~choice_commune~panel_001~1_volunteer=Wait... I hear something. Almost like it's speaking to me...
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_001~1_participant=<participant>'s fingers slip into the wound and pluck the seed neatly free of its nesting place.
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_001~2_participant=The Ox bows its head, feeling nothing...
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_002~1_volunteer2=<participant>...
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_003~1_narration=In a few moments, the Ox's breathing normalizes. Its muscles relax. It takes tentative steps to the edge of the clearing.
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_004~1_volunteer2=Incredible!
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_005~1_legend=That's when a gang of afflicted beasts filters out of the trees.
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_006~1_leader=Get ready for a fight!
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_007~1_legend=They don't lunge. They remain still and stare. They recognize the seed in <participant>'s hand and absorb the visible recovery of the Ox.
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_008~1_legend=There's a collective sigh.
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_008~2_legend=When they lie down, the light in their eyes dims, and dies.
~05~player_chose_operate.test_pass~panel_009~1_healer=The Ox wanders free.
~06~player_chose_operate.test_fail~panel_001~1_participant=<participant> makes a concerted effort, but...
~06~player_chose_operate.test_fail~panel_002~1_participant=It's too slippery!
~06~player_chose_operate.test_fail~panel_003~1_narration=...the seed burrows deeper in.
~06~player_chose_operate.test_fail~panel_004~1_participant=The Ox charges off in agony, knocking <participant> to the forest floor.
~06~player_chose_operate.test_fail~panel_005~1_attacker=Glows flare in the forest all around.
~06~player_chose_operate.test_fail~panel_006~1_participant=Stand firm!
~07~player_chose_execute~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.poet.60:Fate often presents a bitter choice that is no choice at all.../We can at least make it quick.>
~07~player_chose_execute~panel_003~1_leader=At the last, the old ox's eyes seem happy to find rest.
~07~player_chose_execute~panel_005~1_actionSmall=[aqua]Garuuu!
~07~player_chose_execute~panel_007~1_coward=Um, that may not have been the only beast in the area...
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_001~1_volunteer=As <volunteer.mf:he/she/they> attempts to commune with the Ox, <volunteer> is struck by a measure of its pain.
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_002~1_volunteer=Beast. Old Ox. Can you understand me? How do we help you?
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_003~1_narration=The Ox turns its head slightly as <volunteer> addresses it. Then its whispering voice enters <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> mind:
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_004~1_narration=With a quivering hoof, the beast marks some lines in the dirt.
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_004~2_actionSmall=[navy]I've seen. Where the thing goes.
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_005~1_actionSmall=[navy]Kill it. But first. Kill me.
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_007~1_volunteer=Let it be done, then.
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_008~1_leader=At the last, the old ox's eyes seem happy to find rest.
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_009~1_volunteer=<volunteer> scribbles down the Ox's map.
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_010~1_volunteer=This way!
~08~player_chose_commune~panel_010~2_volunteer=They won't even know we're coming.
