~01~prompt~panel_006~1_target=That coin is responsible for more victories than you’d think.
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_target=I forgot it on a hunt one time and I couldn’t hit a thing.

~06~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_ship=Maybe the <foes.plural> were able to snag it off of that critter.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_target=Yuck. Don’t make me think about some <foes.cdgmt:smelly mushroom-man using it in a ritual./scaly brute grinning over it./gross tentacles getting it all sticky./creep bolting it to his skull./nasty mandibles gnawing on it.>
