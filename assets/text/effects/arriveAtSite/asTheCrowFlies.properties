~01~prompt~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.snark/poet/60:Oh good. The day has suddenly turned to night. That's not creepy./The skies above! They've turned from day to night!/Hey, did anyone else notice that ... it's not daytime anymore?>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_poet=<poet.poet.60/leader/coward:What enchantment is this?!/How is this possible?/What's going on?!> We just ate and the sun was directly overhead in the clearing we were in!
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=Suddenly, the bush next to <hook> errupts into a flurry of ebon feathers.

~01~prompt~panel_003~3_actionSmall=*caw*
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_narration=They burst out of the treetops, a spiral of onyx, their raucous caws startling the other birds around them.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=Just as suddenly, they spiral back down, forming a tight ball of whirling black, almost like smoke.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=Until ...
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=<hook.romantic/poet/coward/60:What is this? Why is my heart beating so fast? She  ... seems so familiar .../Some fell spirit! And yet, she seems so familiar .../Oh no, she's looking right at me! And yet, she seems so familiar to me .../Who is she? She seems ... so familiar!>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_darken=Yes, <hook>. Familiar indeed.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=<hook.coward/hothead/romantic:How ... how do you know what I'm thinking?!/You can read my mind?? How?!/You know my thoughts, and yet, I sense so many things about you as well ...>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_darken=The separation between us is an incidental thing. Still, it troubles me.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_darken=And I wish to be whole.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook=I ... I know her. From my dreams ... Of flight and ...
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_darken=... feather.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_darken=What say you, <hook>? Are you ready to embrace me once again?
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_hook=*Whoosh*
~02~choice_two~panel_001~1_target=You feel like a part of me. Yes, I'm in.
~03~choice_three~panel_001~1_hook=I've known you in dreams, but the time is not right yet.
~04~choice_four~panel_001~1_hook=RrrrRRRRrr! Get[b] [i]OUT[][] OF MY HEAD!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_target=<hook.romantic/healer/goofball:We are already as one./Let there be no divide between us any longer./Here's to hoping you don't swallow me whole!>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_leader=<hook>!!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~2_narration=A small tornado of talon, beak, and feather engulfs them.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_narration=When the dark cloud clears ...
~06~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_target=<target.leader/bookish/coward/60:My friends still need me. This land still needs me./My tale is not yet done being written./The yearning I feel is no match for my trepidation./This is not the right time for me to join you.>
~06~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_darken=And so you curse us once again to this half existence.
~06~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_darken=Very well, <hook>, but I won't let you forget me this time ...
~06~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_narration=A bundle of black feathers falls at <hook>'s feet. And glinting within ...
~07~player_chose_four~panel_001~1_hook=The only thing you'll be embracing is my fist. Get out of my head!
~07~player_chose_four~panel_002~1_darken=You would refuse me?! SHUN my gifts? DENY what we are?!
~07~player_chose_four~panel_003~1_darken=You will RUE the day you denied me, <hook>!
