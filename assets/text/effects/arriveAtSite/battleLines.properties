~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=After many days of hard travel, the party has finally arrived at <site>, exhausted in both body and spirit...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_rival=Go dig the latrine hole, will you <hothead>?
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hothead=Me? It's your turn tonight.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_rival=Yeah, but I had to dig you out of that sinkhole this morning. I figure that's my digging for the day.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hothead=Well I wouldn't have stepped in the sinkhole if you'd warned me about it. [bold]YOU[] were on point.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_rival=I was watching for <foes.plural>! Watching where you step is [b][i]your[][] job!
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_hothead=And digging the latrine tonight is [b][i]your[][] job, so get to it!
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_coward=Please. Calm down. We're all cranky and tired. It's been a long journey, <coward.bookish/coward/loner/60:but this is why I made a schedule for chore rotation. So we wouldn't have to fight about it./but try to keep it down! We're in enemy territory! Something might hear you./but can you two relax? I just want to enjoy the fire./but surely that's no excuse for arguing over the latrine.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_rival=Pfff. I didn't see [b][i]you[][] help dig <hothead.mf:him/her/them> out.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_hothead=Yeah. No one asked for [b][i]your[][] opinion.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_rival=No one asked for [b][i]yours[][] either, but that never stops you...
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hothead=You got the [b][i]shovel[][], you do the job!
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_coward=...
~02~choice_one~panel_001.(leader_is_goofball)~1_leader=Maybe I can defuse this with a joke...
~02~choice_one~panel_002.(leader_is_healer)~1_leader=They're out of control. I should step in to help...
~02~choice_one~panel_003.(leader_is_poet)~1_leader=I should remind them we're on the same side...
~02~choice_one~panel_004.(leader_is_hothead)~1_leader=That's it. Time to shut them up...
~02~choice_one~panel_005.(leader_is_loner)~1_leader=I should make them leave each other alone...
~02~choice_one~panel_006.(leader_is_snark)~1_leader=Idiots. I'm gonna teach them a lesson...
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_leader=Best to let them settle this themselves...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001.(leader_is_goofball)~1_leader=Can somebody [b][i]please[][] dig the latrine quickly? --Cause I'm gonna need it, like, real soon.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_002.(leader_is_healer)~1_leader=You two are clearly exhausted from the journey. You don't know what you're saying.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_003.(leader_is_poet)~1_leader=Look, we're all on the same team here. The <foes.plural> are the enemy, not each other.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_004.(leader_is_goofball)~1_leader=And trust me: [b][i]everyone[][] will be happier if the job's done by then...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_005.(leader_is_healer)~1_leader=Hit the sack and get some sleep. You'll need it tomorrow. [b][i]I'll[][] dig the latrine for you.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_006.(leader_is_poet)~1_leader=If we can't even work together to set up our [b][i]camp[][], how can we possibly hope to make the Yondering Lands safe again?
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_008.(leader_is_goofball)~1_rival=heh
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_008.(leader_is_goofball)~2_hothead=heh
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_009.(leader_is_healer)~1_rival=...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_009.(leader_is_healer)~2_hothead=...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010.(leader_is_poet)~1_rival=...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010.(leader_is_poet)~2_hothead=...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_011~1_rival=I guess I'll do it. It is my turn.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_011~2_hothead=I'll help. You did dig me out earlier.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_012.(leader_is_goofball)~1_speech=Heh. And the faster we get this done, the better...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_013.(leader_is_healer)~1_speech=Deal. And once we're done, I'm gonna sleep for a week...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_014.(leader_is_poet)~1_speech=Deal. Today a latrine, tomorrow the world!
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_015.(leader_is_goofball)~1_speech=Nicely done.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_015.(leader_is_goofball)~2_coward=Nothing like a common cause to bring people together.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_016.(leader_is_healer)~1_speech=Nicely done.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_016.(leader_is_healer)~2_coward=Nothing like a good guilt trip to bring people together.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_017.(leader_is_poet)~1_speech=Nicely done.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_017.(leader_is_poet)~2_coward=Nothing  like a common cause to bring people together.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_018.(leader_is_goofball)~1_leader=...plus, I really do need to go.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_018.(leader_is_goofball)~2_actionSmall=...rrrrumble
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_019.(leader_is_healer)~1_leader=...also, I really need to go.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_019.(leader_is_healer)~2_actionSmall=...rrrrumble...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_020.(leader_is_poet)~1_leader=...also, I really need to go.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_020.(leader_is_poet)~2_actionSmall=...rrrrumble...
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_001.(leader_is_hothead)~1_leader=Shut up! Both of you! You're bickering like children!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_002.(leader_is_loner)~1_leader=Enough bickering! Why doesn't everyone just go back to their tents and call it a night?
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_003.(leader_is_snark)~1_leader=Just dig the friggin' hole already. We need somewhere to dump whatever this [b][i]shit[][] is between you two.
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_004.(leader_is_hothead)~1_rival=[b][i]You're[][] like children!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_004.(leader_is_hothead)~2_hothead=You're [b][i]all[][] like children!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_005.(leader_is_loner)~1_rival=Fine! I will!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_005.(leader_is_loner)~2_hothead=Me too! Dig your own latrine!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_006.(leader_is_snark)~1_rival=Go dump your [b][i]own[][] shit!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_006.(leader_is_snark)~2_hothead=Yeah! Screw this!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_007~1_rival=I'VE HAD IT WITH EVERYONE TONIGHT!!!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_007~2_hothead=YOU PEOPLE ARE MAKING ME CRAZY!!!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_009~1_leader=Really? You think?
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_009~2_coward=...mmmmaybe you should have stayed out of that.
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_010~1_leader=Well I didn't hear you helping!!!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_010~2_coward=Don't blame [b][i]me[][]!!!
~05~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_010~3_volunteer=Hey, where's the latrine?
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_001.(leader_is_hothead)~1_leader=Don't worry. These spats burn themselves out as long as we don't add another participant...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_002.(leader_is_loner)~1_leader=I think we've all spent too much time together lately. Give them some distance, They'll work it out.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_003.(leader_is_snark)~1_leader=Don't worry. It won't last. If nothing else, one of them is going to need the latrine soon...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_004~1_rival=I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_004~2_hothead=YOU'RE MAKING ME CRAZY!
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_005~1_rival=...huff, huff, huff...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_005~2_hothead=...huff, huff, huff...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_007~1_rival=Halfsies?
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_007~2_hothead=Fine.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_008~1_rival=I guess it is my turn...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_008~2_hothead=Well, you dug me out earlier...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_009.(leader_is_hothead)~1_speech=Good thing we cooled down before this got really ugly...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_010.(leader_is_loner)~1_speech=Yeah. I guess we've all been spending a little too much time together lately...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_011.(leader_is_snark)~1_speech=Besides, I'm gonna need the latrine pretty soon...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_013.(leader_is_hothead)~1_leader=I've been in a few of those kinds of spats myself. I can tell how much life one has left in it.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_013.(leader_is_hothead)~2_coward=How'd you know?
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_014.(leader_is_loner)~1_leader=Sometimes, I just need a little distance myself.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_014.(leader_is_loner)~2_coward=How'd you know?
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_015.(leader_is_snark)~1_leader=If there's one thing I know, it's when [b][i]not[][] to pour more fuel on a fire.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_015.(leader_is_snark)~2_coward=How'd you know?
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_016.(leader_is_hothead)~1_leader=...besides, I kinda need the latrine.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_016.(leader_is_hothead)~2_actionSmall=...rrrrumble
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_017.(leader_is_loner)~1_leader=...also, I need the latrine
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_017.(leader_is_loner)~2_actionSmall=...rrrrumble...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_018.(leader_is_snark)~1_leader=...also, [b][i]I'm[][] gonna need the latrine pretty soon...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_018.(leader_is_snark)~2_actionSmall=...rrrrumble...
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_001.(leader_is_goofball)~1_leader=They're just blowing off a little steam. I'm sure we'll all be joking about it in the morning...
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_002.(leader_is_healer)~1_leader=They need to get it off their chests. The wounds that are left to fester are the ones that do the most damage.
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_003.(leader_is_poet)~1_leader=Don't worry. After all the dangers we've faced together, it will take more than campsite chores to drive us apart.
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_004.(leader_is_goofball)~1_rival=You're the biggest joke in the party!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_004.(leader_is_goofball)~2_hothead=Me? A joke? Coming from [b][i]you[][], that's hilarious!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_005.(leader_is_healer)~1_rival=I hope you get a sucking chest wound!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_005.(leader_is_healer)~2_hothead=I hope I [b][i]give[][] you one!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_006.(leader_is_poet)~1_rival=I'd rather fight <foes.plural> than work with you!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_006.(leader_is_poet)~2_hothead=I'd rather fight <foes.plural> than [b][i]look[][] at you!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_007~1_rival=YOU ARE THE WORST!!!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_007~2_hothead=WHAT DID I EVER DO TO DESERVE THIS!?!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_009~1_coward=...mmmmaybe you should have jumped in there.
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_009~2_leader=Really? You think?
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_010~1_leader=Well I didn't hear you helping!!!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_010~2_coward=Don't blame [b][i]me[][]!!!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_010~3_volunteer=Hey, where's the latrine?
