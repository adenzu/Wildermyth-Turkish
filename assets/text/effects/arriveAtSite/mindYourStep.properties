~01~prompt~panel_001~1_snark=Why do Deepists always have to be so ... deeply underground?
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/goofball/60: Funny you should ask! Glythian the Traveler wrote that ---/If they were above ground would we call them the Above-ists?/I think they do it just to annoy you./>
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_speech=Hey! Come check this out!
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_bookish=What'd you find?
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_speech=I'm not sure ...
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_speech=But whatever they are, they're blocking the way forward.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_snark=<snark.snark/healer/hothead/60: Mushrooms? Are you seriously worried about some fungus? /They don't look so dangerous. Probably just some kind of mushroom./They're just mushrooms. Why not stomp on through?/They look like some sort of fungus or mushrooms. What's the problem?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_leader=Some mushrooms are deadly. Look closer.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_narration=As they watch, a small creature scurries past them, and into the cluster of fungi.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_snark=What's that smoke?
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_speech=I don't know! Back up!
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_leader=I think it's spores!
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_narration=The cloud envelops the creature, which struggles briefly, and then lies still.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_snark=Uh, maybe we should go around.
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_speech=We don't have time. Who knows where those other tunnels lead. We saw the Deepists go this way.
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_leader=We can't risk touching those puffballs! We would have to be VERY careful.
~02~choice_three~panel_001~1_leader=I think we can get through without disturbing them.
~02~choice_three~panel_001~2_self=<bookish.eventRoll:roll_three|difficulty_three>
~03~choice_four~panel_001~1_snark=Death by puffball?! What kind of legacy is that! I think we should find another way!
~03~choice_four~panel_001~2_self=<snark.eventRoll:roll_four|difficulty_four>
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_001~1_leader=Let's just take our time here. Try not to disturb them.
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_002~1_bookish=Don't bump into a puff. Don't bump into a puff!
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_002~2_narration=They go one by one through the deadly cluster.
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_003~1_bookish=We made it!
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_003~2_narration=Until they are finally on the other side.
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_004~1_snark=<snark.hothead/greedy/loner/60:I knew we'd be fine! Come on. We have Deepists to slay./Whatever those things were put there to guard will be ours. Let's get a move on./Let's get this done and get out of here. I've been trapped in here with you lot for long enough./Success is ours! Now let's go get those Deepists.>
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_005~1_bookish=Shhh! Do you hear that?
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_005~2_leader=Sounds good! Follow m --
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_006~1_bookish=The Deepists! And they don't know we're here. Let's get 'em!
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_001~1_leader=Let's just take our time here. Try not to disturb them.
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_002~1_bookish=Don't bump into a puff. Don't bump into a puff!
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_002~2_narration=They go one by one through the deadly cluster.
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_003~1_bookish=Oh no!
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_003~2_bookish=*bump*
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~1_bookish=We made it. But I don't feel so great.
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~2_leader=Can you go on?
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~3_narration=Until they are finally on the other side.
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_006~1_bookish=I ... I think so.
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_007~1_snark=<snark.hothead/greedy/loner: Come on. We have Deepists to slay./Whatever those things were put there to guard will be ours. Let's get a move on./Let's get this done and get out of here. I've been trapped in here with you lot for long enough.>
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_008~1_bookish=Shhh! Do you hear that?
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_008~2_leader=Sounds good! Follow m --
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_009~1_bookish=The Deepists! Well, hopefully I won't hinder us too much. Let's get 'em!
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_001~1_snark=Come on! There's a side passage this way!
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_002~1_leader=This way does seem easier ...
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_003~1_bookish=Are we ... going in circles?
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_003~2_narration=About an hour later ...
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_004~1_bookish=I swear I've seen that stalactite twice already.
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_005~1_snark=How can you tell? It all looks the same!
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_006~1_snark=I'm joking! You all need to learn to trust me.
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_007~1_snark=[i]Shhhhh![]
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_007~2_leader=Very funny. Wher --
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_008~1_snark=Look.
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_009~1_bookish=The Deepists! You found them!
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_009~2_leader=And they don't know we're here.
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_010~1_leader=Good job, <snark>. I'm sorry I doubted you.
~06~player_chose_four.test_pass~panel_011~1_snark=Let's get 'em.
~07~player_chose_four.test_fail~panel_001~1_snark=Come on! There's a side passage this way!

~07~player_chose_four.test_fail~panel_004~1_bookish=I swear I've seen that stalactite twice already.
~07~player_chose_four.test_fail~panel_005~1_snark=How can you tell? It all looks the same!
~07~player_chose_four.test_fail~panel_006~1_leader=You have no idea where you're going, do you.
~07~player_chose_four.test_fail~panel_007~1_snark=<snark.hothead/greedy/loner: I've been taking us on the scenic route! No death-poofs! You think you can do better? / Why don't [b]YOU []see if you can get us out of here then, if you're so smart!/I should just leave you behind! You think you can find a better way?>
~07~player_chose_four.test_fail~panel_008~1_bookish=Shhh! Do you hear that?
~07~player_chose_four.test_fail~panel_008~2_leader=Easily! Follow m --
~07~player_chose_four.test_fail~panel_009~1_bookish=Well lucky us! The Deepists. And they've heard us!
