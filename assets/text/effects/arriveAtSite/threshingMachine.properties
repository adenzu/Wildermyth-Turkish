~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=They make their way carefully through the ruins of <site>, every nerve alert...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_bookish=I keep thinking about harvest time.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_bookish=<volunteer.parentOf.bookish:Remember harvest times? /When I was a kid, I helped my parents thresh the wheat, you know?>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_bookish=<bookish.snark.60: It's a barrel of laughs, let me tell you. / I hated it. >
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_bookish=You stand there with the bundles spread out on the barn floor and you swing the flail over your head and down on the wheat. Over and over again. For hours.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_bookish=<bookish.snark.60: You keep hoping you'll actually die of the boredom, but you don't. And it takes[italics][bold] weeks.[] / It took days. Weeks. >
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_bookish=Until the year the inventor with the threshing machine came to town.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_bookish=<bookish.snark.60: It took eight adults to push the power wheel around and around, and another two to load the wheat into the mouth of the separator. So, you know, not exactly sitting around with your feet up... / It took eight adults to push the power wheel around and around, and another two to load the wheat into the mouth of the separator. So it was still hard work...>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_bookish=But the machine threshed the wheat of five farms that day. In one day, it saved five families two weeks of backbreaking work. And all I could think was...
~02~choice_two~panel_001~1_bookish=The thing they called the "mouth" of the separator? It did look like a mouth. A huge, hungry mouth. With teeth.
~03~choice_one~panel_001~1_bookish=....it was a miracle. Think  what we could do if we had more machines like that. Think how wonderful the world could be.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_volunteer=So...Morthagi. Really not your favorite.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_bookish=<bookish.snark.60:Just figuring this out now, are you? / Hate the things.>
~04~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_volunteer=Good. Get in here.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_volunteer=This would be an inconvenient moment for you to have second thoughts.

~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_volunteer=So you're saying...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_volunteer=...if we found ourselves surrounded by Morthagi right now...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_volunteer=...you would need a moment to decide whether you wanted to study them or destroy them?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_bookish=No, you idiot, I'd come running to your defense. No moment needed.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~2_actionSmall=click
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_bookish=I'd just try not to kill them all. So I could study one later.
