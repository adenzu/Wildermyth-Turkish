~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=They've been late all day. Late rising, late on the trail, late to recognize sunset, and late spotting this ruin.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=It's the remains of a smallish structure<overlandTile.bghps:, splayed and molding in a starlit clearing./, lying toppled by a dried up stream./.

~01~prompt~panel_005~4_poet=Someone worked at this table.\nKnife lines. Stains of sediment.
~01~prompt~panel_005~5_ship=Ash on the floor?
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_statRetirementAge=It's chalk.
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_ship=What're these hashmarks?
~01~prompt~panel_007~4_ship=And what's in the box?
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_poet=Remember there's that verse in 'Opal Knight?' When Spirra comes to the Umberlady's hall?
~01~prompt~panel_009~5_poet=[light]Past the opened portal, shadows packed like ravens plumed,\nDimming all discovery, sharply dark and darkness-doomed.\nSpirra's sparklight shimmered spent: snuffed, dispelled, \n        Left all engloomed.
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_poet=This place isn't like that, I guess. \nBut nowhere's poem-perfect.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_ship=The box is puzzle-locked. <ship.snark.60:If anyone... cares.../>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_statRetirementAge=<statRetirementAge.personality:There's an earlier verse that I found riveting.

You got a word-hoard under that scalp?/[face:neutral]So do you see anything we could use?/[face:interested]I think it's good you can hold onto so much of it. I lose verses pretty quick./[face:skeptical]Hate how long and slow that one is. Practically no action until the end./[face:happy]I do love the Knight-verses. Used to dream myself into them, sometimes./The Umberlady's hall. The Umberlady. Yeah, those were my favorite parts./You think it's knight with a 'K', or no 'K'? Either way suggests a different story.../[face:joy]All my youth was spent wondering what Spirra Yona looked like. And if <statRetirementAge.awm:she/he>.../[face:skeptical]Never moved me much. But that's not surprising, is it?>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_poet=Hm?
~01~prompt~panel_014~4_ship=One of those magic puzzle locks.
~01~prompt~panel_014~5_poet=Oh. Is it words or numbers?
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_poet=Thank all gods!
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_ship=Words.
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_ship=<ship.bookish/goofball/snark/60:Bygone generations were bonkers for these things. Puzzle locks./[face:happy]We guess until we're frustrated.

~01~prompt~panel_016~5_statRetirementAge=Remind me how these function...?
~01~prompt~panel_017~6_poet=Lockwords, they called them. The words or phrases that'd spring the box open.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_narration=The magic lock presents a prompt, with a clear slate to write an answer:
