~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=<hook> discovers a recessed door in the earth. A bit of digging and <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> able to squeeze through to a buried chamber. It's lit by everlamps along the walls, and who knows how long the lamps have glowed here in the underground.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=Hey, <hook.rfln.bookish:<hook.rivalLevel.bookish:<bookish>/<bookish>/stinker/slug-lips/supernose>...!/<hook.friendLevel.bookish:<bookish>/<bookish>>.../<hook.loverLevel.bookish:<bookish>/<bookish>/<bookish>/<bookish>>...?/you! The smart <bookish.mf:guy/girl/one>!>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=The laboratory is full of books and dark odors. Dust crowds towards <hook>'s freshly dug entrance.

~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=Slate tables wear covers of pale cobweb.

I guess not.>/<bookish.bookish.80:[face:interested]Pff...! Aw come on. It's only an amazing, practically unprecedented discovery. You think I'm into that?/I'm supposed to love this? I'm not that boring, am I?>/Not very clean, is it?/Am I the smart <bookish.mf:guy/girl/one>?>
~01~prompt~panel_007.(hook_is_bookish)~1_hook=<hook.rfln.bookish:<bookish.coward.60:I'll ignore that because I want you to focus on this neat thing./Oh, please. Nothing scary could've survived in this dusty old pit.>/<bookish.bookish.80:Absolutely. Here, look./Oh, come on, I'm right there with you. Check this out!>/We both know you like it dusty, <bookish>!/Let's at least proceed under that assumption.>

~01~prompt~panel_010~1_narration=A hulk of tortuous bone and machine-work occupies the far side of the room.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=What do you suppose that is?
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=The strange device suddenly clicks into motion. Gold gears whir inside, as dust pours from its joints like steam.
