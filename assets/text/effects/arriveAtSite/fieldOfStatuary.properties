~01~prompt~panel_001~1_leader=Hmmm, that's <site> up ahead, but I don't see any smoke coming from the chimneys. No lights on in the houses.

~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_leader=They can come at us, but it's going to cost them!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_loner=Come on, the trail of corruption leads this way.
