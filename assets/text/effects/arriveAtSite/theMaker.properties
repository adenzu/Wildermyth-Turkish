~01~prompt~panel_001~1_leader=Hmm, this looks like a good place to camp for the night.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_healer=Are you okay, <hook>?
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook=Huh? Oh, yeah, sorry. Was lost in thought.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_healer=Looked like some dark ones.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_hook=Well ... I guess I just never expected that this would be my life.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook=Did I ever tell you that I used to work as a <hook.whm:stonecutter/carpenter/weaver>?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook=<hook.whm:Working with something so heavy and brittle, you had to learn what shapes they liked, how much weight they would take./You'd be amazed at the shapes you can convince wood to hold, if you know where to support it./The loom looks complicated, but once you learn how it all fits together, you can focus on the pattern you want to make.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=It felt good, crafting things.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook=<hook.loner/leader/healer/poet/bookish/coward/romantic/goofball/snark/greedy/hothead:What can you do, though? The world pulls you away sometimes./But maybe that's not what the world needs right now./And now I use these hands to kill./But these days, my pursuits are decidedly more grim./But it seems almost frivolous now, with danger encroaching./I wonder about that life sometimes, when things get tough./And now I use these hands to destroy./This job is more "destroying," but.../So thanks for stomping all over that, <foes.plural>./This job requires more "destroying."/So thanks for stomping all over that, <foes.plural>.>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_healer=I didn't think this is where I'd end up either.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_healer=Actually, I have an idea for those skills ...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_healer=<healer.healer/bookish/leader/romantic/coward/loner/greedy/goofball/snark/:Just helping people in town was so fulfilling. I thought I had everything I needed./I thought I'd be a scholar. Stitch together lost histories, travel the world looking for artifacts./I had a knack for teaching. I never thought too hard about what, exactly./All I wanted was a spouse, a house, and some fat, happy children./All I wanted was a spouse, a house, and some fat, happy children./I spent some time on the water, thought I'd have a boat of my own one day./I always thought I'd settle into some business and have a perfectly fine life./All I wanted was a spouse, a house, and some fat, happy children./Don't ask me where I thought I [i]would[] end up, though. It didn't really matter./>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_hook=But when the call came ...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~2_healer=I answered, same as you.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_healer=<healer.healer/leader/60:It's not the life I envisioned, but we're making a difference. / We're where we need to be, even if it's not where we thought we wanted to be. / Maybe we can return to those easy times one day./>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_healer=Oh. Well
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_leader=You two are still awake?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~3_narration=Later...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_healer=BUT... Behold!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~2_hook=Sure is!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~3_leader=Is that a diorama of the attack site?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hook=Should be! Now see, the layout here lends itself perfectly to this sort of trap design.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_leader=What the... is this to scale?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_leader=You're not wrong. It's pretty clever.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_leader=Too bad we don't have time to rig it up.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_narration=Later still...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_leader=Let's just hope it was worth the sleep deprivation.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~2_narration=Much later...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~3_leader=Are you serious?
