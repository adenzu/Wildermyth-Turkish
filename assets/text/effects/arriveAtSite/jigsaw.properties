~01~~panel_001~1_speech=This place gives me the creeps. What kind of weirdos would want to live here?
~01~~panel_002~1_target2=<target2.leader/healer/bookish/poet/60:I don't think anyone ever lived here./This doesn't feel like someone's home./I don't think anyone ever lived here. This building had a different function. /This place is too solemn and stately to have ever been someone's home./I don't think anyone ever lived here. >
~01~~panel_003~1_target2=<target2.leader/healer/bookish/poet/60:Look, it's all wide open. Until the roof caved in, there would have been no cover at all. /Look at the height of the walls. There must have been a huge domed ceiling./Look at the proportions - the height of the walls and all the empty space./Even with the roof fallen in and the weeds taken over, you can still see how much empty space used to stretch away inside here./Look at the height of the walls. There must have been a huge domed ceiling. >
~01~~panel_004~1_target2=<target2.leader/healer/bookish/poet/60:It must have been built well inside a settled territory, well after defenses and other necessary structures./It must have been so lovely and calm and still./There's no sign of a living area or working area. This architecture was built to awe./This was a place to come and be still, a place to hear the universe echo around you./This was a gathering spot for a community.>
~01~~panel_005~1_target2=<target2.leader/healer/bookish/poet/60:And if you look close, you can see how beautifully it was once decorated. /...except for the times when it was filled with a community coming together to celebrate or to comfort each other.  /A community doesn't build something like this until after it has all it needs for defense and livelihood./A place that needed many people to build it and make it beautiful./And if you look close, you can see how beautifully it was once decorated.>
~01~~panel_006~1_target2=It was a shrine.
~01~~panel_007~1_coward=Am I the only person wondering to whom or to what? [small] Our shrine experiences have been a little...varied.
~01~~panel_008~1_target2=<target2.greedy/healer/60:We might find a clue to the builders in that chest over there. (And if not, maybe something shiny.)/I expect those who built this place preserved what was important to them in that chest over there. It's just about the only thing left intact./We might learn something about the builders if we looked in that chest over there.>
~01~~panel_009~1_target2=It's going to need all three of us to get it open.
~01~~panel_010~1_target2=...one...two...
~01~~panel_011~1_target2=...three!
~01~~panel_012~1_target2=Well, that's...
~01~~panel_013~1_target2=...I'm not sure what that is.
~01~~panel_014~1_coward=It's not a that so much as a...them?
~01~~panel_015~1_goofball=Are those...legs?
~01~~panel_016~1_target2=I think so? So it's the lower...third?...of a statue?
~01~~panel_017~1_coward=Wait, why would anyone store a statue in thir --
~01~~panel_018~1_goofball=Uh, team? Weapons out; the party's coming to us --
