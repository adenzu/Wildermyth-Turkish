~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/goofball/loner/greedy/poet/snark/60:\nSorry. But these crystalline deposits are so bizarre. I can’t imagine how they came to be here.../\nI’m just… guarding the rear. You know. For safety./\nAwwww, do I have to? I was hoping to lag behind and get picked off by <foes.plural> alone in the dark.../\nSorry. It’s just so still down here. So quiet. Even by my standards.../\nJust checking out these crystals. I can’t tell if they’re gemstones or just shiny rocks./\nSorry. I don’t like it here. It feels as if the cold of these rocks permeates my very soul.../\nYou don’t like the way I rear guard? Feel free to do it yourself./\nI'm coming! It just feels so cramped down here--even for a <foes.singular> Lair...>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=In the deep caverns beneath <site>...
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_target=<Hero>, keep up!
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hero=Besides, the torches are all up in the front. It’s hard to see where I’m--[b][i]WHOA[][]!
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hero=WHOOSH!
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_action=WHUMP!
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hero=Ow.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hero=What... where...
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hero=...wow.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hero=What...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hero=Is...
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hero=[b][i]THAT?!?[][]
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hero=How long has this been down here?
~01~prompt~panel_013.(hero_is_bookish)~1_hero=That crystal… it’s so odd… I’ve never seen morphology like that before...
~01~prompt~panel_014.(hero_is_coward)~1_hero=*shudder* That crystal… it’s like an eye, watching me wherever I go...
~01~prompt~panel_015.(hero_is_goofball)~1_hero=Did the <foes.plural> leave us a present? How sweet.
~01~prompt~panel_016.(hero_is_loner)~1_hero=A shining treasure, lost in the dark. All alone. I know how that feels...
~01~prompt~panel_017.(hero_is_greedy)~1_hero=And how [b][i]much[][] is that gem worth?
~01~prompt~panel_018.(hero_is_poet)~1_hero=An extraordinary stone, surrounded by ordinary rock...
~01~prompt~panel_019.(hero_is_snark)~1_hero=And how much will it tick off <target> if I take it?
~01~prompt~panel_020.(hero_NOT_bookish/coward/goofball/loner/gree..._(60))~1_hero=That gem... it looks like there's writing on the back of it...
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_hero=*Hrk* It’s jammed in there pretty tight…
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hero=*sigh* I should probably leave it be.
~03~choice_two~panel_001.(hero_is_bookish)~1_hero=If I pry it out, I could take it back for study...
~03~choice_two~panel_002.(hero_is_coward)~1_hero=If I pry it out, it’ll stop watching me.
~03~choice_two~panel_003.(hero_is_goofball)~1_hero=I bet I could pry it out, though.
~03~choice_two~panel_004.(hero_is_loner)~1_hero=If I pry it out, I could rescue it...
~03~choice_two~panel_005.(hero_is_greedy)~1_hero=If I pry it out, I’ll have a small fortune!
~03~choice_two~panel_006.(hero_is_poet)~1_hero=If I pry it out, I can set it free...
~03~choice_two~panel_007.(hero_is_snark)~1_hero=I bet I could pry it out, though.
~03~choice_two~panel_008.(hero_NOT_bookish/coward/goofball/loner/gree..._(60))~1_hero=If I pry it out, maybe I can get a better look...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_hero=Ah well. I should probably find the others...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_hero=...hmmmmmmmmm...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_target=<hero>! There you are! What happened?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_hero=Eh. Found an old statue.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~3_speech=Well [b][i]<volunteer.exists:we/I>[][] found the <foes.plural>! Form up!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_npc=If I can just get my knife in under there…
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_hero=...hmmmmmmmm...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_npc=Something's wrong... what's--
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_hero=...mmmmMMMMMMMM...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_npc=ARRRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~2_hero=....MMMMMMMMMMM!!!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_hero=*pant, pant* What… what was...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_speech=<hero.bookish/coward/goofball/loner/greedy/poet/snark/60:Oh no!/\nOh boy.../\nOops./\nMy face!/\nOh crap./\nOh dear.../\nAw, nuts./\nUh-oh.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_hero=I don’t… I’m not… There was this gem in the statue...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~2_target=<Hero>! There you are! Where did you--*gasp* What happened to your face?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007.(hero_is_bookish)~1_hero=I wanted to study it, but it… it did something to me.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008.(hero_is_coward)~1_hero=I knew there was something wrong with it! I [b][i]knew[][] it!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009.(hero_is_goofball)~1_hero=...and it, uh… well… it attacked me. Yeah.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_010.(hero_is_loner)~1_hero=It seemed so lost and helpless somehow...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_011.(hero_is_greedy)~1_hero=It should have been worth a [b][i]fortune[][], dammit.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_012.(hero_is_poet)~1_hero=It seemed wrong, somehow. To leave it here.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_013.(hero_is_snark)~1_hero=I guess someone forgot to put up the sign that said “Cursed Gem. Do Not Touch.”
~05~player_chose_two~panel_014.(hero_NOT_bookish/coward/goofball/loner/gree..._(60))~1_hero=I tried prying it out, which, in retrospect? Bad idea...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_015~1_target=Well whatever happened, the <foes.plural> must have heard that scream. Form up! They’ll be all over us now!
