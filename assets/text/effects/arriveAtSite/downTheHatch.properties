~01~prompt~panel_001~1_npc=Well, hey there, folks.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_leader=Hello, we're on the lookout for some <foes.plural> that were spotted in this area.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_npc=Oh, them. Yeah, those damned creatures are holed up in the nearby mine.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_npc=Locked themselves away in the tunnels!
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_greedy=A mine? Like, a gold mine?
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_npc=Nah, nothing as fancy as that. It was just iron.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc=They killed a few of the miners, rest their souls. The others fled.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_npc=We tried to help them, but we're just farmers and shepherds here.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=Not heroes like you all.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_leader=[gray] ...Was it the outfits that gave it away?[]
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_loner=<loner.goofball.60:I'll go poke around./I'll go check it out.>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_loner=They're holed up in the mine that the farmer mentioned, but I found a way in through an old ventilation shaft!
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_narration=Later ...
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_loner=We should sneak in, take them by surprise.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_leader=Let's flush them out!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_loner=The entrance is just ahead!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_loner=There's the mine! We just need to climb up over here!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_greedy=Whew, that looks like a tight squeeze. Glad I didn't have that second piece of mutton at lunch.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_leader=Welp, down we go!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~3_loner=They have no idea we're coming!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_leader=We're going to need some pine branches and a few blankets.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_npc=Blankets you say? I'll run home and get some for you!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_greedy=Thanks.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_npc=No thanks needed. It feels good to be able to do something to help.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_narration=Later...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_leader=Perfect! Now you add the branches while I use the blankets to push the smoke in!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_action=*cough*
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~2_action=*COUGH*
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~3_greedy=*Cough*
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_greedy=It's working! <loner>, get ready for the ambush!
