~01~prompt~panel_001~1_leader=The Thrixl shouldn't be too much further ahead of us.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_leader=I ... could have sworn they went this way!
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_loner=They did. Look. Behind these rocks.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_leader=<leader.snark/leader/coward:Some ... enormous holes?/What have you found, <loner>?/Holes ... in the ground?  .... I don't want to climb in a hole!>
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_loner=Tunnels. Burrowed deep into the earth.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_loner=<loner.leader/hothead:Should we check them out? / I say we get in there! We can't let them get away!>
~02~choice_three~panel_001~1_hothead=Let's take the battle to them! Down we go!
~02~choice_three~panel_001~2_darken=<hothead.eventRoll:roll_three|difficulty_three>
~03~choice_one~panel_001~1_leader=Let's not be hasty. We can lay a trap and wait here for them to emerge.
~03~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=<leader.eventRoll:roll_one|difficulty_one>
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_001~1_hothead=<hothead.hothead/leader/poet/60: Down we go! Bringing the fight to you, insects!/Everyone watch your step. Here we go!/Into the earth we descend, our hunt will only know one end. YOURS, bugs!/Down it is! Let's do this!>
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_002~1_leader=Wow, these tunnels are huge!
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_002~2_narration=One by one, they climb into the hole. It turns out to be a short passage which leads into a wide tunnel!
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_003~1_leader=[gray]Quietly now. We don't want to lose our advantage.
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_004~1_narration=They creep through the tunnels, ears straining for the slightest of sounds.
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_005~1_leader=[gray]I see something!
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_005~2_narration=After what seems hours ...
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_007~1_leader=Thrixl did this. They're close. Come on!
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_008~1_narration=Finally ...
~04~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_008~2_greedy=There they are. And they have no idea we're here!
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_001~1_hothead=<hothead.hothead/leader/poet/60: Down we go! Bringing the fight to you, insects!/Everyone watch your step. Here we go!/Into the earth we descend, our hunt will only know one end. YOURS, bugs!/Down it is! Let's do this!>
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_002~1_leader=Wow, these tunnels are huge!
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_002~2_narration=One by one, they climb into the hole. It turns out to be a short passage which leads into a wide tunnel!
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_003~1_leader=[gray]Quietly now. We don't want to lose our advantage.
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_004~1_narration=They creep through the tunnel, ears straining for the slightest of sounds.
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~1_narration=But...
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~2_greedy=Crack!
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_006~1_hothead=[gray]I ... an old root ...
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_007~1_hothead=Gulp
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_008~1_hothead=[gray]Do you hear that?
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_008~2_action=Chitterrrr...
~05~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_009~1_leader=Little late for whispering now. They're coming!
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~1_leader=Hurry! Who knows when they'll get back!
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_002~1_hothead=<hothead.hothead/coward/greedy: This is a cowardly way to engage our foes!/They're going to never fall for this! We should attack./We should get in there and see what they are hiding! They could be making off with who knows what treasures they might have!>
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_003~1_leader=<leader.healer/snark/bookish: Sometimes the best route is the safest. It's not cowardly to use every advantage./Not every conflict can be resolved by rushing in head first, <hothead>./You know, even Ragalan the Rager was known to set traps for his enemy. And he's still remembered as one of the greatest heroes that ever lived.>
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_004~1_hothead=I ... you're right. Let's get started.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_005~1_greedy=Now we cover it with fallen leaves!
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_005~2_narration=Working together, they fashion a trap from nearby saplings.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_006~1_loner=[gray]I hear something!
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_007~1_leader=[gray]Everyone, hide!
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_008~1_narration=They quickly duck behind the rocks, the sounds of chittering growing ever louder.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_009~1_narration=The insectoid creatures emerge from the earth, spindly legs carrying them into the sunlight. \nAnd then ...
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_009~2_action=SPRONGGGG!!!
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010~1_hothead=It worked!
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_011~1_leader=Yes. But it won't hold them for long!
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_012~1_leader=We have the advantage! ATTACK!
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_001~1_leader=Hurry! Who knows when they'll get back!
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_002~1_hothead=This is a cowardly way to engage our foes!
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_003~1_leader=We're committed to this course now, <hothead>. Let's just get it done.
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_004~1_narration=Working together, they fashion a trap from nearby saplings. But the work goes slowly with the anger that's simmering.
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_005~1_loner=[gray]I hear something!
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_006~1_leader=[gray]They're coming! But the trap isn't ready! Everyone, hide!
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_007~1_narration=They quickly duck behind the rocks, the sounds of chittering growing ever louder, until finally the creatures emerge.
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_007~2_greedy=[gray]They know!
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_007~3_actionLarge=Chitter!!
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_007~4_action=*Clack* Brrrack!
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_008~1_actionHuge=Chitter!!
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_008~2_leader=So much for our advantage! Here we go ...
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_008~3_action=BRRRACCKK! |
