~01~prompt~panel_011~1_ship=That one seems to have a lot to say. Can you make out any of it?

~01~prompt~panel_013~2_volunteer=Shiny. Probably.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_volunteer=Sure. I would love something shiny, thank you.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_volunteer=You want to be useful? Go mob the <foes.plural> for us.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_volunteer=The crow gurgles and hops forward, then flies off.

~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_volunteer=The crow lowers its head in a cock-eyed sort of bow.

But deeds themselves can shine./Drauven have lots of shiny bits./Gorgons have lots of shiny bits… though maybe not the kind of shiny you’re thinking of./You might not guess it beneath the rust, but Morthagi can be quite shiny./Thrixl have lots of shiny bits.

~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_ship=...What are the odds that they'll do it?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~2_actionSmall=[white]Kraww!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_ship=Don't they always sound like that?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~2_volunteer=Not impossible. That racket sounded something like a war chant.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_narration=Either way, the confusion and peck marks over at the <foes.cdgmt:Deepist camp/Drauven camp/Gorgon cluster/Morthagi gathering/hive of Thrixl> certainly looked promising.
