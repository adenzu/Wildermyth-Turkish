~01~prompt~panel_002.(target_is_Bookish)~1_target=I didn't know Patchy Hagweed grew in this area.
~01~prompt~panel_003.(target_is_Bookish)~1_target=Normally its environment is <overlandTile.bghps:sunnier/wetter/lower/sunnier/drier> than this, but if the Whittleflies are around [small]to pollinate...[]
~01~prompt~panel_004.(target_is_Coward)~1_target=Does that tree look suspicious to anyone else?
~01~prompt~panel_005.(target_is_Coward)~1_target=I’d better go check.
~01~prompt~panel_006.(target_is_Goofball)~1_target=Ohh, the blind bear wed a mossy log, one dewy summer’s morrrn!
~01~prompt~panel_007.(target_is_Goofball)~1_target=And the cats and the grackles\nDid not stop their cackles,\n‘Til the litter of bear-twigs was borrrn!
~01~prompt~panel_008.(target_is_Greedy)~1_target=Anybody see a good flat rock?
~01~prompt~panel_009.(target_is_Greedy)~1_target=The leather on this pack is quality stuff, I don’t want it getting muddy.
~01~prompt~panel_010.(target_is_Healer)~1_target=The poor <overlandTile.biome> critters don't know what's about to hit them.
~01~prompt~panel_011.(target_is_Healer)~1_target=I suppose vultures are always happy to see a battlefield.
~01~prompt~panel_012.(target_is_Hothead)~1_target=Stoke your bellies and grind your blades.
~01~prompt~panel_013.(target_is_Hothead)~1_target=And smile! Tomorrow, there will be <foes.plural> to scrape off our boots!
~01~prompt~panel_014.(target_is_Leader)~1_target=Alright. I’m in good shape.
~01~prompt~panel_015.(target_is_Leader)~1_target=If anybody else needs help with gear, let me know. I’ve got some decent tools.
~01~prompt~panel_018.(target_is_Poet)~1_target=Some trees weep, have you noticed?
~01~prompt~panel_019.(target_is_Poet)~1_target=Perhaps once grieving souls, now mercifully cursed.
~01~prompt~panel_020.(target_is_Romantic)~1_target=The sky is blushing.
~01~prompt~panel_021.(target_is_Romantic)~1_target=Maybe she has secrets for a sweetheart’s ear.
~01~prompt~panel_023.(target_is_Snark)~1_target=Another entertaining evening, brought to you by <company>.
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_hero3=<target.personality:Sometimes I’m surprised <target.mf:he’s,she’s,they’re> out here and not in a workshop or library somewhere.\n/<target.mf:He seems,She seems,They seem> a little jumpy still. But I’m sure <target.mf:he’ll,she’ll,they’ll> smooth out those edges eventually.\n/I mean, <target.mf:he seems,she seems,they seem> to be enjoying <target.mf:himself,herself,themselves>.\n/<target.mf:He seems,She seems,They seem> to have some pretty high standards. \n/I keep wondering if that sensitive soul is going to break, but it hasn’t yet.\n/There’s quite a blaze in that one, for sure.\n/Pretty well, I’d say. Hero-ing seems to naturally fit some people.\n/If I could get <target.mf:him,her,them> to open up a little bit, I could tell you.\n/I bet the inside of <target.mf:his,her,their> head is a very interesting place, with a very interesting inner voice.\n/It's funny. If you had to dream up a “fresh-faced young hero” for your tale, I think you would dream up <target>. \n/[face:skeptical]<target.mf:He certainly has,She certainly has,They certainly have> opinions. I [i]think[] <target.mf:he’s,she’s,they’re> happy? It’s hard to tell.\n>
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_ship=How do you think <target> is settling in?
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_hero3=Why? What do you think?
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_ship=...Oh, I agree with you.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_ship=And don’t tell anyone, but it irritates the heck out of me.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=Rivalry
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_ship=And I think <target.mf:he’ll,she’ll,they’ll> do just fine.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=Friendship
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_ship=And don’t tell anyone, but it’s <target.personality:just irresistible/so endearing/so endearing/strangely compelling/so endearing/just irresistible/just irresistible/absolutely captivating/utterly dreamy/just irresistible/strangely compelling>.
~04~choice_three~panel_001~2_darken=Romance
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_ship=<target.personality:\nIf I have to hear one more “clarification” from <target> on something completely irrelevant...\n/If I have to deal with [i]that[] until the Yondering Lands are cleared out, I’m not sure what I’m going to do.\n/<target> thinks <target.mf:he’s,she’s,they’re> funny or something. And that’s... sure. But it’s getting old quickly.\n/Being in this for loot or glory is fine, but you can still be [i]classy[] about it.\n/You ever wonder if <target.mf:he’s,she’s,they’re> just playing at being more virtuous than the rest of us?\n/Sighhh... ”Yes, <target>, you’re a <target.whm:big tough fighter/deadly shadow-slayer/terribly frightening mage>,” we all get it. Calm down.\n/Who does <target> think <target.mf:he is,she is,they are> sometimes, anyway? <target.mf:He hasn’t,She hasn’t,They haven’t> earned any more respect than any of us.\n/If <target> didn’t want to join a group, nobody was forcing <target.mf:him,her,them>. <target.mf:He,She,They> could at least make a token effort.\n/Some people think that if they use fancy enough phrasing, it absolves them of having to do [i]anything else.[]\n/Sure, maybe <target>’s the shining beacon of <target.mf:his,her,their> own story, but it’s not a story [i]I’m[] on the edge of my seat for.\n/There’s a fine line between “incisive” and “obnoxious,” and I think <target> hasn’t figured out which side is which.>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_ship=...What, does it not irritate you? How could it not?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_target=So you want me to prove myself or something?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_target=To you, specifically?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_009~1_target=Because we can do that.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_ship=After all, nothing like a bunch of <foes.plural> breathing up your back to bring people together.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_target=I can do the patrol tonight if no one else wants to.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_ship=Now see?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_ship=[i]There’s[] the <target.mf:fella,gal,hero> you want on your side.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_ship=<target.personality:There’s just something about a smart <target.mf:guy,girl,person>. Quiet, understated, but powerful.\n/<target> just needs a rock, you know? Someone <target.mf:he,she,they> can depend on. \n/<target>’s outlook is something you can’t help but smile at.\n/<target> is a <target.mf:guy,girl,person> who knows what <target.mf:he wants,she wants,they want> and isn't ashamed to enjoy life's pleasures.\n/Someone with a heart like <target>'s—you don’t come across 'em every day.\n/Somebody like <target> reminds you that you have blood in your veins, you know?\n/<target> speaks, and it’s just… sigh. I’d follow <target.mf:him,her,them> anywhere. It’s hard to explain, but…\n/A <target.mf:guy,girl,person> with some depth. A bit of mystery, you know?\n/<target.mf:He has,She has,They have>... a way of seeing the world, and it makes you want to see it through <target.mf:his,her,their> eyes.\n/<target> is somebody who hasn’t given up on beauty and love, even in the face of horror. \n/<target> is... perceptive. I have to smile at <target.mf:his,her,their> points, in spite of myself. Maybe I’m just a sucker for a well-barbed comment, but...>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_ship=How could you not fall for that?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_007~1_target=I was just about to get more firewood. I could use some company.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_009~1_hero3=Don’t run off and start a new life together! We’ve still got a job to do!
