~01~prompt~panel_017~1_narration=Two cold memories floated into <target>'s head.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_narration=Fashioned of bones...
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_narration=...and long hidden.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_narration=But as the figure began to fade,\nso did the memories...
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_narration=If <target> concentrated, <target.mf:he/she/they> could hold on to one.

Who steals [i]bones?[] Sheesh, give me more credit than that./And I think...  maybe someone wanted us to have it./They can happen to anyone, you just have to pay attention.>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_012~2_ship=<target.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/poet:[face:skeptical]Probably not the pleasant kind./[face:interested]Hm? No. No, of course not./Just checking./Honestly, I'd probably give it away too./...Right.>

~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_ship=<ship.personality:[face:skeptical]I had one of those dreams where I was trying to classify <foes.plural>, but they kept not fitting into categories. Extremely frustrating./[face:grim]I had the tooth dream again. I hate that one./[face:happy]I had that dream with the flying cat again. I rode it this time!/Sigh... I dreamt that <town> threw us a feast. Disappointing to wake up in the tent./[face:interested]I dreamt that someone came and told us that <foes.plural> never actually existed. Then I woke up and was disappointed./[face:joke]I dreamed the battle went well. Good sign, right?/[face:grim]I dreamed the battle went badly. Hope it doesn't throw me off./[face:skeptical]I had a dream that I became a tree. You'd think that would be a bad dream, but it wasn't./[face:interested]I had a dream that you disappeared. Glad you didn't./[face:interested]I had a dream that we were all paintings and could jump between canvases... strange./[face:dubious]Whole bunch of weird dreams last night. I blame my sinuses.>

~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_target=I wish I could remember more dreams. It sounds interesting.
