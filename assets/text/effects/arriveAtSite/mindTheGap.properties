~01~prompt~panel_001~1_coward=Nothing good.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_leader=What do you see, <coward>?
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_coward=Or nothing remotely sturdy, anyway ...
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_coward=Not really. If there is one, we'll have to look further south.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_leader=Do you see a way down?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_coward=I think a finch's weight on that thing would collapse it.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_hothead=<hothead.goofball/60:We could take off our gear and try to cross it naked! Maybe being lighter will help!/[face:interested]Maybe we could go over one at a time?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_coward=Or maybe we can try to fix the bridge? We do have to come back this way.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_leader=Could we use ropes to get down?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=The discussion continues ...
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_leader=<hook>! No!
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hothead=<hook.mf:He's/She's/They're> not going to make it!
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hothead=Should ... should we try it?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_coward=No way! It's going to fall apart any minute!
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hothead=It was sturdy enough for <hook>! I'll give it a try!
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_leader=I have another idea ...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_coward=We'll find another way around, <HOOK>!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_narration=Hours later ...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_hook=Oh hey, you made it! Where have you all been?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_leader=We had to find a way to climb down the ravine and up the other side!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~2_coward=We ended up fighting some <coward.leader/goofball/loner:angry goats/giant rodents/vulture-looking thing> with too many limbs and what I'm pretty sure was acid breath!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~3_hothead=Didn't you hear us calling for you?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_hook=Oh, sorry, no. I got bored waiting and took a nap.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_001~1_narration=<hothead> starts across cautiously, then ...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_002~1_hothead=AHHHHHHH!!!!
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_003~1_coward=*huff*
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_003~2_darken=*huff*
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_004~1_hothead=*huff*
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_004~2_hook=... It's quite sound ...
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_001~1_narration=<hothead> starts across cautiously, then ...
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_002~1_action=[neutralAspect]*CRRACK!*
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_003~1_hothead=AAAHHH!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_005~1_hothead=Hang on, I've got you!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_006~1_hook=Rrrr-urf!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_006~2_coward=[gray]vwoop!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_007~1_hook=<hook.leader/goofball/bookish:It's going down, let's move!/Thar she blows! Let's go!/Looks like it can't hold two of us, hurry!>
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_007~2_action=snap!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_007~3_coward=crreeaaakk
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_008~1_hothead=[neutralAspect]CRR...
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_009~1_hothead=[neutralAspect]CRASHHH!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_011~1_leader=Well then.
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_011~2_coward=We'll... find a way around, I guess.
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_012~1_hook=Why didn't you wait for me to finish securing my rope? Didn't you see me tying it off?
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_012~2_hothead=Uhm, rope?
~08~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_leader=TIMBER!
~08~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_actionLarge=*FWUMP*
~08~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_coward=This is crazy!
~08~player_chose_three~panel_004~2_leader=You'll be okay, <coward>, just don't look down.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_leader=Pretty sly, huh?
~08~player_chose_three~panel_005~2_hook=Oh yeah, totally.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_hook=If they didn't know that we were coming before, they sure do now.
