~01~prompt~panel_002~1_friend=Grabbing a few more mushrooms?
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_poet=Hm? Oh. No...
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_poet=I was looking for a decent feather.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_poet=For a… <poet.romantic/poet/80:a passing fancy./a passing breeze of fancy./thing. Little something.> It’s not important.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_friend=<friend.bookish/romantic/greedy/hothead/80:[face:happy]Important enough to be a [i]mystery,[] apparently./[face:happy]Important enough to be a [i]mystery,[] apparently./[face:joke]”...<poet.mf:he says/she says/they say>, thinking [i]that[] will appease <friend>.”/[face:joke]”...<poet.mf:he says/she says/they say>, thinking [i]that[] will appease <friend>.”/I won’t laugh, if that’s what you’re thinking.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_poet=We snag what little bits of comfort we can in a world gone awry. Some people pray to gods. Some carry totems and talismans.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_poet=And on the edge of a battle, sometimes I like to make my own little appeals to fate.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_friend=Have you always done this?
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_poet=<poet.coward/poet/80:If I think I won’t be able to sleep otherwise./Not always. But when the crickets have that extra quaver in their songs, you don’t ignore it./When it feels like the right time.>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_poet=Aha.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_poet=First, I gather the bits. Gotta have the bits.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_poet=A feather for speed, a pebble for strength, and a bit of moss for wisdom.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_friend=What does moss have to do with wisdom?
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_poet=You know of something that would fit better?
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_friend=...Fair.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_poet=Then I make a short appeal for each person. They don’t need to hear it themselves. It would only put them on the spot, start them overthinking.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_poet=But I feel better having spoken it to the <overlandTile.biome>. The <overlandTile.biome> may not take suggestions, but you plant the seed, just in case anything out there is in a listening mood.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_narration=Satisfied with the recently-pocketed feather, <poet> heads back towards camp.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_friend=Hey. Let me join in.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=<friend.eventRoll:roll_one|difficulty_one>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_friend=Sounds kinda personal.
