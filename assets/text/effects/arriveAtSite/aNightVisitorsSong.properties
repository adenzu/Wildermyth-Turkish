~01~prompt~panel_001~1_poet=<leader.rfln.poet:You must have things on your mind, huh? You're usually badgering me about something./What would [i]you[] do, <leader>? If you found your heart racing at the thought... of another? Someone you stood beside through danger and then...?/I would tell you how beautiful you look by firelight. But any light is lucky to land on you.../There's been times in my life I would've given a finger to have a good fire.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_leader=<leader.rfln.poet:[poet.face:skeptical]<leader.personality:Just puzzling out our course over the next few days. [i]Someone[] has to do the head-work./[face:interested]What do you mean? I'm not thinking about anything. Why? You already ate./[face:joke]Imagining what we'd look like dressed as animals. I'd be a badger, you think? Well I'd paint you as a lovely glumpfing pig![poet.face:dubious]/I don't badger, I [i]advise[]. No, if you must know, just remembering a beltbuckle I saw in the market before we left. I hope it's still there./[face:dubious]Badger? I don't think I badger anyone. But then, no one else tends to tune me out the way you do.../Who's badgering who? I'm enjoying a quiet fire for once, and you're jabbering and nosing into my thoughts./[face:dubious]Oh, alright. I badger you, do I? Well at least we get results. And trust me, we could always replace you./[poet.face:joy][i]I[] badger [i]you[]? What are you even talking about? You keep asking what my thoughts are...!/[face:grim]I've always got castles twirling in my head, you know? No, I suppose you don't know. Puzzles, myths, questions./[face:joy]As if I had a reason to badger [i]you[]! Trust me, I gave up on you a long time ago./[face:interested]Yes, I have mind-stuff. Loads of mind-stuff, going on as we speak. Or as we don't speak. I'm very opaque and mysterious, you see?[poet.face:dubious]>/<lover.exists:You mean someone... not <lover>? <leader.personality:That's its own kind of conundrum, isn't it? I'm not sure I can give you a wise answer./[face:sad]I don't want to hear about that, <poet>. I just, uh... I don't want to have to, uh...[poet.face:sad]/[face:joke]Wow, uh. Is this about me? <poet>, if you really...[poet.face:dubious]/Guess I'd explore my options? But I'm already not the type to be held down, if I want something./[face:happy]Well, that's natural, I suppose. I'd really weigh what I wanted, if that were me./[face:angry]Wait, are you [i]admitting[] that!? Who are you thinking about?/[face:talking]In your place? I'd wait for it to pass, I suppose. It could hurt the whole group, you know?/I don't know. Probably wouldn't do anything. Being me./[face:grim]I think about scarlet starlings. Flirting a hundred ways, often losing track of their nests./[face:interested]I've never been good at resisting. Even the merest glimmer of curiosity captures me.../While it's terribly interesting to think about, I'm not sure my answer would suit you.[face:dubious]>/<leader.personality:[face:interested]Oh. Um, I'd... Well, each person's different. I'd try to learn what they like, what their feelings are, and... I'd form a plan of some sort./[face:interested]Uff, what [i]would[] I do? Probably nothing. If it's meant to be, then they'll... I mean, they'll probably let you know, right?/[face:joke]Oh, <poet>... are you trying to tell [i]me[] something?[poet.face:dubious]/I mean, if I really wanted to... wouldn't I just ask? I mean, isn't that the nature of desire? But.../[face:happy]Wow, uh... I suppose I'd look at the whole picture. How it might affect them. And the others. But that's me.../[face:talking]You're thinking of someone in particular, aren't you? I'd just ask them. Right? What's there to lose?/[face:talking]It's interesting. I suppose I'd chance it. Asking them, I mean, if... as long as I thought it wouldn't destroy the group./[face:grim]I don't know. I don't know what that's like, I guess./[face:interested]Mortality is a thing I think about a lot. And with mortality in mind, I suppose I'd pursue any chance I had at... you know. [i]Living[] more powerfully. Loving./[face:interested]I've never been good at resisting. Even the merest glimmer of curiosity captures me.../[face:skeptical]I don't think I really could say. I practically don't have a heartbeat. I'm made of ashclay.[bookish.face:skeptical]>>/[poet.face:interested]<leader.personality:[face:happy]As I tell you all the time, anything we see is just... you know. A product of the light that paints it. Don't just... talk like you don't know that./[face:interested]Me? No, I'd... I'd never claim such a thing. Um. But... I always wonder if you...?/[face:joke]And [i]you[], darling! No one looks so perfect when all the lights are snuffed...![poet.face:skeptical]/[face:happy]You can keep talking like that, you know? I won't mind./[face:happy]I don't feel I deserve you, sometimes. But thank you./[face:joy]Keep that talk up. You're well on your way./[face:interested]How long do you think we can keep facing danger? I worry about you, you know?/[face:grim]Mm. Look at the stars. They'd be more visible if we doused the fire./[face:happy]This would be a good night for a story, wouldn't it? Or a song?/[face:happy]Look at the night, <poet>. The beauty is all around us. It's perfect for a kiss by emberlight.../[face:dubious]Really? The mosquitoes land on me in herds. I'm going to be a walking itch-lump by morning. Will I be beautiful then?>/Yeah? <leader.coward/goofball/healer/leader/loner/60:[face:interested]But... you really think you could go through with something like that?/[face:interested]Suppose it's good you didn't meet the Finger Collector, then. That guy was [i]weird[]. Bet he knew fires, though.../[face:interested]I hear you. Don't want to get caught out in the cold on a night like this./[face:interested]Everyone's got breaking points./[face:skeptical]That's nice. I... um./[face:interested]Sorry, but... Which finger?>>
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_loner=<loner.hothead/loner/60:Hey, stop mumbling, you two. \nListen to that.../Stop that mumbling. \nThere's a sound./Shh. Stop mumbling for a second. You hear that?>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_leader=[tan]*scuff*
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_leader=[tan]*murmur*
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_narration=Hushed voices and careful footfalls approach down the overgrown path.
~01~prompt~panel_004~4_narration=To <loner>'s ears, even these muffled noises are perfectly loud.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_loner=Come forward, strangers. If you're friendly, come forward slowly...
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_action=[gray]. . .
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_narration=Silence, perhaps a minute of it, is all the answer that emerges from a thick wall of brush.
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_narration=Then...
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_loner=...we can... we hear your...
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc2=<npc>, you dolt! They're not fooled by this. <poet.bookish/greedy/leader:We're  prolonging the inevitable./We can always offer money./And I'm standing in ants.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_npc2=Introduce us!!
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_npc=Yes, Mistress. Um. Should I offer myself?
~01~prompt~panel_009~5_npc=Ho there!
~01~prompt~panel_009~6_leader=Ho?
~01~prompt~panel_010~5_npc=You look like experienced... whatever you are. Bandits? Rogues? Not hounding for captives, I hope?
~01~prompt~panel_010~7_leader=<leader.goofball/hothead/loner/60:[face:joy]Why? Are you someone important, bushmaster?/[face:angry]Us? You think [i]we're[] ruffians?/[face:grim]What good are more mouths to feed?/Come on out of there. You're caught anyway.>
~01~prompt~panel_011~5_npc=Heh, well...
~01~prompt~panel_012~8_npc2=Oh, move it, you fool! <poet.bookish/greedy/leader:How are you so miserable at this?/Why do I let you talk to people?/Anything's better than ants up my dress!>
~01~prompt~panel_013~5_npc=Sorry, Mistress... \nHere, take my arm.
~01~prompt~panel_014~3_narration=A pair of travelers clambers free of the bracken, their clothing fine but a tad filthy.
~01~prompt~panel_014~5_npc=Hello, strangers. I'm <npc.firstname>, servant and apprentice to this prestigious and lovely woman, who...
~01~prompt~panel_015~5_npc=Well, perhaps we shouldn't use your real name?
~01~prompt~panel_017~3_poet=That's <npc2.fullname>!
~01~prompt~panel_018~4_npc=Oops. <poet.mf:He knows/She knows/They know> your name.
~01~prompt~panel_019~3_poet=<npc2> the Dreamchanter! Poet and peerless singer. Impossible to turn away an ear when she's plucking strings, spinning yarns, deploying her famous vowels!
~01~prompt~panel_020~8_npc2=And why wouldn't <poet.mf:he/she/they>?
~01~prompt~panel_021~6_leader=Well, you don't seem like a threat. Come sit by the fire, we're not in any kind of bad business.
~01~prompt~panel_021~7_npc2=By the fire sounds grand!
~01~prompt~panel_021~8_npc=Mistress...
~01~prompt~panel_021~9_loner=<leader>...
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_narration=The small camp settles a little awkwardly. Introductions go round.
~01~prompt~panel_022~2_narration=Shortly thereafter <poet> can't help <poet.mf:himself/herself/themself>. <poet.mf:He bends/She bends/They bend> <npc2>'s ear.
~01~prompt~panel_023~3_poet=<poet.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:Our reality is indivisible from our mythology. That's a quote from Meledeen, as I'm sure you know. You really cemented the truth of it for me, though. See.../Maybe this'll sound stupid to you, but... you really gave me courage to breathe life into my dreams. I... no, but.../[face:happy]Yours was the first performance that actually... Well, [i]moved[] me, in a genuine way. I don't often go for serious Poetry, you know? The capital 'P' kind? But.../Used to want to collect everything. Every poem and song. Not for others, just for myself. But that's not [i]your[] way. I grew a desire to share, because.../And I understand, I suppose. Not everyone will be able to appreciate artistry at its highest level. That's not their fault, but../[face:angry]Makes me want to shake them all, honestly. <poet.age.30:The younger folks just don't/Those dullwits, those powergrubbers. They never> appreciate artistry. Don't know the names of our treasured poets and performers./Personally, I can find merit in most stories or songs. But the great performances are truly something special./[face:grim]You inspired me. Not many people have. See, I'm not partial to the skippy little tales they peddle these days. The Great Romances. The Epics. Those [i]matter[]./[face:dubious]Nowadays it's all tickle-rhymes and merry bloom bops. Stuff so saccharine it makes me vomit. It's the old stories, the true poetry... Those are the things that [i]matter[]. Always have./I've lived my life according to stories: the plots, the great characters, the messages that lay nested within... And [i]you've[] been an inspiration to me, certainly.>
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_poet=<random:I was there when you sang [i]Starsailors[] in <Hometown>. Flawless./I got to listen to your performance of [i]Glimrseen[] in <Hometown>. Masterful./You sang [i]Queen of the Seas[] in <Hometown>. I [i]wept[].> <leader.bookish/healer/snark:Rumor was you intoned all of the [i]Oldwane Saga[] in a day and a night, and no one dared chew a morsel./I heard about your rendition of [i]Wadshan[], spoken for an audience of craftspeople. Not a dry eye, they said./You recited [i]Tree of Looms[] in full, pageless, without rest. People still talk about it.>
~01~prompt~panel_024~2_leader=<leader.rfln.poet:[face:dubious]/[face:neutral]/[face:happy]/[face:interested]>
~01~prompt~panel_025~2_npc2=Yes, yes. I remember those days. I try not to miss them.
~01~prompt~panel_026~2_npc=Oh, Mistress, you don't need to say it.
~01~prompt~panel_027~3_npc2=I do, though. Just that... nothing lasts forever. Bad fever took my lofty registers from me. My volume. Performance is such a [i]physical[] thing. Most forget that. I'm weak, nowadays. I lean on him. My student, <npc>, there.
~01~prompt~panel_027~4_npc=Mistress...
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_leader=Why not try a small song? Even if it's quiet, even if it's just a shadow of you. We'd like it.
~01~prompt~panel_029~2_npc2=I would love to show that gift to you again. But it's gone now. Only the memory remains.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~3_darken=<poet.eventRoll:roll_one|difficulty_one>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~4_npc2=I... Well, I could try. It's been a few years, now.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_loner=Or we could see what the apprentice has learned?
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~3_npc=Don't strain yourself, Mistress...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~4_narration=<npc2.fullname>, the Dreamchanter, pulls her instrument from its case. A hum collects in her throat, then ebbs. Then rises again, spilling between pitches. And stops.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_002~2_npc2=It's a good night, I think. I may have a few verses in me.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_004~3_narration=First she moves her fingers over the strings of the mandolute. Great rings of sound, chords and twining threads.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_006~3_narration=The melody hangs, and wobbles, and winds around the ear. It curls in the heart like an old dog, returning.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_006~4_npc2=My father wrote this for me.\nIt was my first song.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_007~3_npc2=[white]I sit inside the wind, the moon looks down on me.\n    The places that I've been all linger distantly.\n  I'm here for you, whenever you need me.\n      I'm here to see that someday you don't...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_008~3_narration=Next, she begins to sing.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_009~3_narration=Her voice is sheer as gauze. It yields to the slight sigh of a breeze. But it persists. Trembling strong. It's beautiful.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_009~4_npc2=[white]You'll find me in a tree, if a tree is there to find.\n  Stand tall or on your knees, a tree will treat you kind.\n     Though I'm here for you when you don't want me,\n         I'm here for you in case someday you do.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010~3_poet=Are you...?
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010~4_narration=Suddenly, an unpleasant scrick closes her mouth. \nShe swallows. Appears to be fighting a cough. Unshed tears are starbright in the firelight.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_011~4_npc=Mistress...!
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_012~4_narration=But she shakes her head. \nHer fingers repair the halted tune.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_013~4_npc2=[white]Now I live in smoke, the clouds and cliffs my bed.\n     The weird and rippling water bends around your head.\n  Night comes along like a stray with a song.\n       Asks me to travel on, but I'll wait until you're sleeping.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_016~5_npc2=That's, uh... that was my father's lullaby.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_017~4_loner=<loner.bookish/goofball/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]It's not written down, is it?/[face:happy]Wow, I.../[face:interested]You.../[face:interested]Honestly... Your voice.../[face:interested]Your voice is remarkable.>
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_018~5_npc2=My life, I know, has been blessed.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_019~1_narration=The night before the fight at <site> passes quietly.
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_001~3_npc=Don't strain yourself, Mistress...
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_001~4_narration=<npc2.fullname>, the Dreamchanter, pulls her instrument from its case. A hum collects in her throat, then ebbs. Then rises again, spilling between pitches. And stops. She softly coughs.
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_002~2_npc2=My... I don't think I can manage it.
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_003~4_npc=Mistress...
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_003~5_poet=It's alright. We've got some beer. Some bread and soup.
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_004~1_narration=The night before the fight at <site> passes quietly.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_001~3_npc=Well, I...
~07~player_chose_two~panel_001~5_npc2=Am I so poor a teacher you're ashamed to show what you've learned?
~07~player_chose_two~panel_002~5_npc2=So...?
~07~player_chose_two~panel_003~4_npc=No, Mistress, of course not!
~07~player_chose_two~panel_004~4_narration=Young <npc>, apprentice to <npc2.fullname> the Dreamchanter, removes his instrument from its case. His features, composed, take on a startling dignity.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_006~4_narration=He sings and plays with great skill, a testament to the talents of his mentor. First, he performs a somber ballad...
~07~player_chose_two~panel_007~4_narration=Next, a rousing and farcical tune to turn dour lips up.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_007~5_narration=Smiles pool in the warm orange wash of firelight and song.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_008~2_leader=<leader.rfln.poet:[face:dubious]/[face:happy]/[face:joke]/[face:joy]>
~07~player_chose_two~panel_008~4_narration=He plays well into the night, until others begin to pitch in with stories or songs.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_008~7_loner=<loner.rfln.poet:[face:dubious]/[face:happy]/[face:joy]/[face:skeptical]>
~07~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_narration=The night before the fight at <site> passes easily, in good company.
