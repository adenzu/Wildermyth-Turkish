~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=Outside of <site>, a breeze rolls through the treetops.

~01~prompt~panel_005~1_actionSmall=[blue]shwwwshhh
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hothead=Why is it that wherever I stand...
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hothead=...the smoke follows?
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_goofball=<hothead.theme_fire/theme_tree/theme_vine:I figured you and the fire had something special going on./It smells that greenery in you. Can't resist./It smells that planty smell in you. Can't resist./Law of the wilderness. The campfire always picks a Chosen One.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_coward=Let's hope the wind keeps up. Anything to mask our approach is welcome.
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_action=[gray]wssshhhh
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_actionSmall=*cough*
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_action=zip!

~01~prompt~panel_018~1_hothead=After it! Hurry!
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_coward=<coward.coward/80:Wait a second/Steady there>, we don’t have our gear ready, or a plan, or…
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_hothead=We'll lose the <foes.singular> if we don't move now. And then it gets to <hero.leader/80:tell its friends all about us./blab to its friends about us.>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hothead=Let's [i]go![]
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_coward=We need to at least prepare.
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_volunteer=The rest of you prepare, I'll nab him.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_goofball=<goofball.WeaponType>? <goofball.WeaponType>.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~2_coward=Should I douse the fire? It's probably fine.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~3_narration=A chaotic departure from camp ensues.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_goofball=Running and trying to tighten buckles at the same time is not easy.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~2_action=[blue]*rustle*[]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003.(foes_Deepists)~1_narration=The would-be scout doesn't get far...

~05~player_chose_one~panel_014~1_narration=...before <hothead> and <goofball> bring it down.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_014~2_action=Awwwolgh!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_015~1_coward=Thing is, though...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_016~1_hothead=Been a while since a single <foes.singular> was enough to scare us.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_017~1_coward=It's never just a [i]single[] <foes.singular>.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_017~2_narration=<foes.cdgmt:The sound of bellows and battlehorns goes up not far from them./The reedy sound of Drauven battlecries goes up not far from them./--/--/-->
~05~player_chose_one~panel_017~3_actionSmall=[gray]Awwlo-leeough!\n[]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_017~4_actionSmall=Lee-aowwwll![]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_018~1_hothead=<hothead.leader/80:Firm hearts, now./Look at it this way.> They probably didn't expect this particular turn of events either.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hothead=<hothead.hothead/leader/80:Pfshh./Well./Sigh.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_narration=The footfalls and snapping brush fade away.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hothead=Now they're going to know we're coming. At best.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_coward=<coward.coward/healer/romantic/80:And at least we’re coming with our heads shaken out and our weapons pointed straight./And at least we’re coming with our heads shaken out and our weapons pointed straight./And at least we’re coming with our heads shaken out and our weapons pointed straight./And if that knowledge doesn’t send them scattering in terror, it’s their own fault whatever happens to them once we arrive.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_narration=As they approach <site>, <foes.cdgmt:the wind gives way to the slosh of heavy, cavernous breaths./they feel the pinpricks of reptilian eyes watching them./--/--/-->
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_volunteer=<volunteer.coward/loner/bookish/healer/80:[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:scheming]>The stink of a <foes.singular> isn’t an easy thing to lose.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_volunteer=<volunteer.coward/snark/goofball:If I’m not back in a few minutes though, come looking./[face:dubious]If I’m not back soon, you know the drill. Avenge, whatnot.../[face:happy]If I’m not back soon, you know the drill. Avenge, whatnot.../Tighten your buckles, this won’t take long.>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_friend=<volunteer.whm:<volunteer.mf:He/She/They> can be terrifyingly light on <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> feet when <volunteer.mf:he wants/she wants/they want> to./You almost have to pity the poor dope being tracked by [i]that[] <volunteer.mf:fellow/lady/beast>./After <volunteer.mf:he uses/she uses/they use> the nose, you think <volunteer.mf:he’ll/she’ll/they’ll> finish with the teeth or the magic?>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_narration=Preparations were quick and quiet.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_target=Alright. Good enough for <site>. You?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_007~1_friend=I don't feel [i]in[]competent, for what that's worth.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_008~1_narration=Only the sound of light panting marked <volunteer>'s return.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_009~1_friend=Wow. We didn't even hear you take him down.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_010~1_volunteer=Old Lochias would have liked that one.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_011~1_volunteer=Hopefully the rest of the <foes.plural> didn't either.
