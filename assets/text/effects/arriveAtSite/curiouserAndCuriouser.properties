~01~prompt~panel_001~2_leader=<leader.hothead/poet/60:Look alive, people. The path forks ahead but there's a sign./The path splits in two, but I see a sign./The path forks up ahead. And it looks like there's a sign.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_leader=Hmm.
~01~prompt~panel_003.(hook_is_hothead)~1_hook=Hopefully it tells us how much longer it'll be till we get where we're going! What's it say?
~01~prompt~panel_004.(hook_is_goofball)~1_hook=Does it say, "This way to the loo"? I really have to go ...
~01~prompt~panel_005.(hook_is_greedy)~1_hook=You take the low road and I'll take the [i]gold[] road. Does it say which path will lead us to our fortune?
~01~prompt~panel_006.(hook_NOT_hothead/goofball/greedy_(60))~1_hook=Well, don't keep us in the dark! What does it say?
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_leader=It says, "Do Not Enter."
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_healer=<healer.hothead/snark/60:"Do Not Enter." That's it? Seriously? Why not? Why can't we enter?/"Do Not Enter." Why the blazes not?? Would it have killed them to write like, "DANGER! SHARKS!" instead!?/"Do Not Enter." Well, that's not helpful. Why not?>
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hook=<hook.greedy/romantic/60:Maybe someone is trying to hide treasure from us!/Maybe it's a secret hideaway for forbidden lovers, and they don't want to be caught!/Maybe it's like, something amazing and the sign is to throw us off course!!>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=<hook.coward/healer/bookish/60:Or maybe it's a camp full of Drauven! We can't take the other path and leave potential enemies at our backs!/Or maybe it's a trap! We can't leave it for others to fall into!/Maybe it's the entrance to the Lost City of Alabaram!/Maybe there's a portal to another realm!>
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_leader=We don't really have time for this.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hook=It's too risky to leave enemies behind us. We have to check it out.
