~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The air around <site> <foes.cdgmt:was heavy with drifting spores. The occasional bellow shattered treetops into whirlwinds of frightened birds./was strangely quiet for a place crawling with Drauven. Those that did emerge moved with a stiffness that balanced on the edge between frightened and reverent./burned your throat if you breathed too deeply. The tentacles that pierced the earth pulsed and pushed with more force than usual./reeked, sour and oily. The thrums and clicks that echoed across the <overlandTile.biome> could be mistaken for insects, if you didn't know any better./seemed to rush into it like a vaccuum, eager to forget its former life and seep into the cracks where Thrixl breathe.>
~01~~panel_004.(leader_is_bookish)~1_leader=My whole life, I’ve sought truth.
~01~~panel_005.(leader_is_bookish)~1_leader=But facing an actual Moment of Truth is enough to make one… reconsider.
~01~~panel_006.(leader_is_goofball)~1_leader=This is where we separate the heroes from the…
~01~~panel_007.(leader_is_goofball)~1_leader=...dismembered chunks... of hero? Ew.

~01~~panel_010.(leader_is_healer)~1_leader=This is our moment. For the ones who didn’t make it this far. And more importantly, for the ones yet to come.
~01~~panel_011.(leader_is_hothead)~1_leader=Once and for all, you bastards.
~01~~panel_012.(leader_is_leader)~1_leader=This is it. This is how we put things right.
~01~~panel_013.(leader_is_poet)~1_leader=If I don’t come back, may the stars tell our story to any who would have it.
~01~~panel_014.(leader_is_greedy)~1_leader=Time to earn all that glory once and for all.
~01~~panel_015.(leader_is_snark)~1_leader=I could have bought a cottage somewhere by the Great Sea.
~01~~panel_016.(leader_is_snark)~1_speech=I could be there right now. Sleeping late, watching the waves.
~01~~panel_016.(leader_is_snark)~2_leader=But noooo.
~01~~panel_017.(leader_is_loner)~1_leader=When this is over, I’m going into the woods and not coming out for [i]anything[] for at least two years.
~01~~panel_018.(leader_is_romantic)~1_leader=This one goes out to all you lovers out there tonight.
