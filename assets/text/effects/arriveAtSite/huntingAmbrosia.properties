~01~prompt~panel_001~1_bookish=This is it! <site>!
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_leader=The Morthagi are around here somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_bookish=*knock*  *knock*
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_bookish=We'll fight soon enough, but first ...
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_npc=What ... who are you! What are you doing here?!

~01~prompt~panel_005~1_bookish=This is <site>, isn't it? Home of the best brews this side of <town>!
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_bookish=Your spirits have been called, "The nectar of the gods!"
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_npc=Yeah, this is <site>, and you heard right about my spirits. But I ain't brewed nothin' these past few weeks.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_bookish=But ... why?
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_npc=Thrice cursed Morthagi scum, is why!
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=Come on in. See for yourself.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_bookish=Uumph, that's putrid.
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_npc=Foul use of my fine establishment! They got me brewing up this vile concoction for them. I bring them fresh batches every few days in the ruins. Pour it right into their veins. If they have veins, that is.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_npc=It does something wicked to them, this brew. Makes them faster and stronger.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_leader=Why are you helping them?

~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_romantic=Don't worry, your <npc2.mf:husband/wife/spouse> will be home soon! We'll get <npc2.mf:him/her/them> back!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_npc=You ... you mean it? I haven't seen <npc2.mf:him/her/them> in so long.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~2_romantic=<romantic.romantic/hothead:Indeed! We won't let those monsters keep your beloved! /We're on it.>
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_001~1_bookish=That's right. You should see how they glow afterwards.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_001~2_npc=Hmmm. How do you feel about making a [i]special [] batch?
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_002~1_leader=What are you planning, <bookish>?
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_003~1_bookish=That we mess with the formula.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_004~1_narration=Later ...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_004~2_npc=Are you sure about this?

~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_007~1_leader=Wow, that's ... ew.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_007~2_bookish=It's kind of how hummingbirds feed.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_007~3_romantic=It's totally gross.
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_007~4_bookish=*slurp* *lurp*
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_008~1_narration=At first, it seems nothing happens. And then ...
~06~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_008~2_leader=It's working!
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_001~1_bookish=That's right. You should see how they glow afterwards.
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_001~2_npc=Hmmm. How do you feel about making a [i]special [] batch?
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_002~1_leader=What are you planning, <bookish>?
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_003~1_bookish=That we mess with the formula.

~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_008~1_bookish=Uhm ... nothing's happening?
~07~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_009~1_leader=And they don't look too happy. Get your weapons ready!
~08~player_chose_four~panel_001~1_hook=That's right. You should see how they glow afterwards.
~08~player_chose_four~panel_002~1_hook=I think I'd like to test this brew out ... on myself!
~08~player_chose_four~panel_003~1_npc=Just a few drops now, it's very potent.
~08~player_chose_four~panel_004~1_hook=It's working! I can feel it!
~08~player_chose_four~panel_005~1_hook=Perfect! Now then, let's go get your <npc2.mf:husband/wife/spouse> back.
