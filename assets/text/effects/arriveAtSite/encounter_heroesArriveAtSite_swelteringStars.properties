~01~prompt~panel_006~1_goofball=<goofball.krfln.loner:[face:neutral]Huh? I remember you used to talk omens sometimes.

I just like to give a little nod to what I don't understand, sometimes. And.../I can't really tell you what they mean, specifically. I also think maybe... I mean, maybe listening [i]is[] the point./<loner.loner/60:[face:talking]/[face:happy]>You know, long ago, <random:a wiseman/a treewatcher/a fortuneteller/an augur> read the leafpatterns for me.

~02~choice_two~panel_001~1_goofball=Reminds me of... Can I still remember the story?
~02~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=<goofball.eventRoll:roll_two|difficulty_two>
~03~choice_one~panel_001~1_loner=Is this your sign? My guardians, my guides...
~03~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=<loner.eventRoll:roll_one|difficulty_one>
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_bookish=Maybe I do wonder... <loner.mf:does he/does she/do they> see something I don't?
~04~choice_three~panel_001~2_darken=<bookish.eventRoll:roll_three|difficulty_three>
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_001~1_goofball=A moment or two, <goofball> just gathers <goofball.mf:his/her/their> thoughts.
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_001~2_goofball=Then...
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_002~4_goofball=A wandering <goofball.awm:woman/man> once taught me a tale, and told me it would please the stars, for it [i]belonged[] to them.
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_003~4_goofball=It was before Amalgamation. Things weren't wholly [i]things.[] Our phantoms freely danced on the glass floor of space, while our hearts pumped moonlight until it turned into salt.
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_003~5_narration=<goofball.mf:He speaks/She speaks/They speak> beauty worth believing, \nand <goofball.mf:his/her/their> eye is wet with truth.
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_004~1_goofball=<goofball> begins to spin a yarn. It's the tale of a Star<goofball.awm:woman,man>, who frolicked with shadowy queens and icecrowned kings across ten thousand planets. <goofball.awm:She/He> beguiled the Astral Dragon Lothrankir, yes, and helpfully, <goofball.awm:she/he> balanced the oddsided entirety of creation on the back of a migrant dustbear.
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_005~1_goofball=With each revelation the stars seem to grow and glister. Sweltering, they swim together to shape a gownless <goofball.awm:lady, and she/man, and he> strides and twirls through the cosmos.
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_006~1_narration=At tale's end, as if to call <goofball.awm:her/his> deeds well-counted, the figure bows low, and a stone of <goofball.awm:her/his> diamondstrung hair falls to earth. A gem whose clear core is a captured starflame.
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_007~5_bookish=Is it real?
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_008~1_goofball=It's... warm.
~05~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_009~2_narration=<goofball> has earned a favor of the stars!
~06~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_001~1_goofball=<goofball> tries to remember the tale of the Star<goofball.awm:woman,man>, but ends up telling the story of Telestra Starborn instead.
~06~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_002~1_goofball=It's a good story.
~07~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~1_loner=There's a thing <loner> sometimes believes. That the dead turn to stars, and that their wishes become light. In this moment, <loner.mf:he feels/she feels/they feel> a well-meaning eye turned on <loner.mf:him/her/them>.
~07~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~3_loner=[gray]<loner.personality:You just know certain things, without the need to learn them./[face:interested]I wonder, or I mean I hope... you're beyond pain and danger./[face:happy]They wink at me like they're planning a prank./Not that I'm eager to join you, stars./You've minded me my whole life, I think. I [i]am[] grateful. And.../[face:grim]You know I won't make it far if you abandon me./Nobody makes it alone./I don't think I even knew all your faces./You can see... this tender plum of a heart I've got./[face:interested]It's a wish of the bones, I suppose. \nMy artless and longingful bones./[face:grim]What kind of idiot am I?>
~07~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_002~2_loner=<loner.personality:I wish all study was as simple as that: attending the pure crystal light of a star./[face:interested]We all do join them someday. So we'd better hope they're happy up there./The mischief of stars is maybe what I'm eager to see./Hope they'll save me a place in the north./And if hopes are glows in the hearts of stars... I'll do my best to fulfill them./[face:grim][gray][i]I know it, too.[] So don't abandon me here. Not yet./[face:grim]Nobody ever does make it alone./[gray]I'm sorry. But thank you.[face:grim]/[face:grim][gray]I'm counting on you to protect it./[face:interested]We do owe them thanks. I don't know why, but I know we're cared for by someone in the dark./[face:neutral]A grateful idiot, I suppose. A grateful fool.>
~07~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_003~1_loner=Whatever else the night might say, \n  a new ward is wound round the life of <loner.fullname>.
~08~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_001~1_loner=Gazing up a long while, <loner> sighs to see no familiar shape among sprays and constellations. Nothing <loner.mf:he knows/she knows/they know> a name for, no point to pin a dream on.
~08~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_002~5_goofball=<goofball.krfln.loner:Hey, <goofball.pcfn.loner:<loner>. Kid. I've always been happy you didn't fear the night.[face:talking]/[face:skeptical]uh, <loner.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny?> Tell me the things you look for, sometime. I'll help you find them./<loner>. I'm glad you do what you do. Even though you're pretty weird. Okay?/==>/[face:skeptical]Well, a comet's not an everyday thing, at least. So... there's [i]something[] to mark the night./Stars can be a lot like hillfolk.\nFull of unspeakable language./[face:talking][i]I do[] see a portent up there, myself. That I'll kiss you, when the night's done./Stars can be a lot like hillfolk.\nFull of unspeakable language.>
~08~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_002~6_loner=<loner.krfln.goofball:///[small]Yeah./>
~08~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_003~1_loner=We search and we search. For reason and meaning, we ache and wander.
~08~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_003~2_loner=But meanings are often as faint as \nthe grayest glims behind the darkness.
~09~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_001~1_bookish=<bookish.greedy/healer/loner/poet/romantic/60:I guess the nice thing about seeing signs would be... I mean it's like knowing the enemy's next card. In a game of Bees and Buzzards./Feel like it'd drive me crazy, though. If I thought something was warning me of impending disaster, but I couldn't really... I don't know. Couldn't avoid it?/[face:neutral]I won't say it's ever helped me any. The world. The stars. The omens./Maybe my problem, really, is that interpretations can take us anywhere. Anything as whispy as an omen can be blown into the shape we want to see. Don't you think that makes it... kind of hopeless?/<lover.exists:I mean, the most important things, though... <lover> and I. It wasn't the universe that brought us together. It was the way our souls just... [i]worked.[]/[face:interested]It's funny. I wanted my life to be storylike. Be called somewhere to meet my sharptongued match. You know? But my sign's never appeared.>/Just feel like it's pretty... impossible, maybe.[face:skeptical] \nTo follow starlight and not look like a fool.>
~09~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_001~2_goofball=<bookish.greedy/healer/loner/poet/romantic/60:Helps you bet big, or back off./Maybe it's like weather. Can't change it, but you can dress for it if you know./I agree. You [i]won't[] say that./Surprise of surprises, you're too in your head./<lover.exists:Someone might ask... what led <goofball.rfln.bookish:your/your/our/your> steps to meet in one place, at a particular time?/Maybe it did? And you're already pointed down the right path...>/Think that second bit's not really important, is it? To some of us?>
~09~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_002~1_bookish=A coolness falls over them. A silence of a hundred winks.
~09~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_002~2_goofball=<goofball.rfln.loner:[face:skeptical]/[face:neutral]/[face:happy]/[face:interested]>
~09~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_003~3_loner=We'll never see that comet again.
~09~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_003~4_bookish=<bookish.bookish/greedy/poet/romantic/60:And maybe there [i]should[] be room in a reasonable mind for irrational arguments to circulate.../Thing is, though... to risk anything on an ill-read omen, on misplaced faith. Can't you lose a lot, believing too fully?/Wonder whose regrets stack higher? The mistaken believer, or the cynic who dies correct?/Wonder whose regrets stack higher? The one whose love is never returned, or the one who loves only people that love <bookish.mf:him/her/them>?/I'm just, you know. I don't want to be distracted or disarmed. \nThat's... that's what I'm left fearing.>
~09~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_004~1_goofball=It's a conversation <bookish> will return to often, in <bookish.mf:his/her/their> head. \nIt'll only ever leave <bookish.mf:him/her/them> with more and finer doubts.
~09~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_004~2_goofball=But it'll lend <bookish.mf:him/her/them> vigor, at times, that pondering and soupstirring.
~09~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_004~3_goofball=On those days you might expect gapless rain,\na little doubt can feel like sunlight.
~10~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_001~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/greedy/healer/leader/loner/poet/romantic/60:Doesn't it make sense, rationally, for a world filled with magical... what are they? [b]Sympathies,[] almost.../Am I depriving myself of something important?/I wouldn't call <loner> a total fool. Not to <loner.mf:his/her/their> face, certainly, and not even in the honest chambers of my head./Am I doing a disservice to everyone? By refusing to... to... I mean, it's even hard for me to explain it to myself./I'm fond, myself, of making company with the world's great quiets./My problem's sometimes that I... maybe I gaze at the wider world too much? And through too serious a lens.../And the thing is, I [b]do[] love the idea of a world that's watching out for us. And maybe there's prophecy, and starcrossed lovers, and... and [b]destined[] lovers, too./I get [b]wanting[] omens to be true. I get why people [b]convince[] themselves. That there's a big pair of hands that cradles them, carries them, and will catch them when they fall.>
~10~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_002~2_bookish=<bookish.bookish/greedy/healer/leader/loner/poet/romantic/60:Could such a world be communicating with us, or weaving some grand and subtle pattern?/Am I the fool inheritor, who leaves the family ruby buried, refusing to dig out the old garden?/No, so why do I struggle to credit <loner.mf:him/her/them>... when <loner.mf:he talks/she talks/they talk> about this [b]thing.[] Omens? Signs?/But am I refusing to listen to the warnings of the world, and thus forcing us to face greater danger, less prepared?/Am I [b]senseless?[] Is there a great pattern in front of my eyes, waiting for me to put it together? Or even a candle-thin sign?/Maybe I'm too focused on the vast and ultimate inscrutability of existence... and it leaves me insensitive to the earth's sly language?/Am I someone who confuses good sense with imagination? When imagination is good sense?/But where could that [b]intention[] live, you know? I don't know. Has to be gods and things? Or... a... whew. Or a what?>
~10~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_003~3_bookish=Hm.
~10~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_004~2_bookish=I just. Don't think I'll ever see it.\nMaybe that's the difference.
~10~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~3_bookish=Oh well. What's that line between the bookwitch and--?
~10~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_006~3_loner=[i]"Treasure these questions," clove the Witch, grinning wide.\n"They'll distract you from aging, they'll lengthen your stride."[]
~10~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_008~5_bookish=Yeah. That's the one...
