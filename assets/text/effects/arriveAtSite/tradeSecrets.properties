~01~prompt~panel_007.(foes_Deepists)~1_npc3=Pasty faced creeps! Knocked down the door and walked in without an invitation.
~01~prompt~panel_008.(foes_Drauven)~1_npc3=And in came one of those smelly birds.
~01~prompt~panel_009.(foes_Gorgons)~1_npc3=Busted their way in. Spat their sickness all over the rug.
~01~prompt~panel_010.(foes_Morthagi)~1_npc3=And in they came. Those scrapheap monstrosities.
~01~prompt~panel_011.(foes_Thrixl)~1_npc3=And in they came. Tipping my vats like they had some kind of [i]agenda.[]
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_npc=<foes.cdgmt:Tipping my tables, manhandling my vats.../Ever get feathers in your vats?/Mangy things. That awful [i]stench[].../Not like they can even [i]drink[] what I brew.../Ugly overgrown bugs.>

And <site> is the\nplace I run. Or [i]ran.[] Before those things showed up./<site>. Left it all behind, unthinking. Just trying to save my hide.>
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_npc=Lost track of <npc2> in the scuffle. Figured I'd find <npc2.mf:him/her/them> here, keeping company with <npc2.mf:his/her/their> pig. Been two nights already. Dumb thing won't stop oinking.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_npc=Ah, word [i]does[] travel!
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/poet/60:[face:skeptical]<site>... not a name I'd forget. Where the plum whiskey's brewed?/<site>, huh. Why does it sound familiar? Is it... wait.

~01~prompt~panel_019~1_npc=Plan? Well, I... uh... don't have any [i]particular[] ideas. But... sort of a request?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_npc=That <npc2.mf:meddling man/wearisome woman/pestersome person>. [i]<npc2>[].\nIf <npc2.mf:he/she/they> can be saved...
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_npc=There's a chest I kept under my bed.\nFull of... secrets.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_npc=<npc2.mf:He's/She's/They're> [i]sneaky,[] you know? Too stubborn to die easy. Might've found a hole to crawl into.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_npc=Just... find <npc2.mf:him/her/them> before those <foes.Plural> do. Is what I'm asking.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_npc=Oh, you know, secrets of the craft. There's a reason my brew is [i]special[].
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_hero=What kind of secrets are we talking about?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_npc=<npc2>'s been trying to get <npc2.mf:his/her/their> hands on them for years. Probably why <npc2.mf:he/she/they> stayed behind. Thought <npc2.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> seize the opportunity.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_hero3=[i]If[] <npc2.mf:he's/she's/they're> alive.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_npc=Trust me. That <npc2.mf:man's/woman's/person's> too stubborn to die.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_npc=What I'm saying is, it's more than just a living. The <npc.lastName> family legacy is what's at stake. Know you can't save [i]everything[]. But if you have a chance to secure the back room first, keep Grandpa's recipes from falling into the wrong hands...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_hero=We'll do what we can.
