~01~prompt~panel_001~1_coward=Has anybody seen <foes.cdgmt:any of those cowskulls or weird rock stacks yet?/any of the creepy banners or birdhouses yet?/any stray tentacles yet?/any of those telltale scrap piles yet?/webs yet?>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_leader=This fog is so thick I can barely see [b][i]anything[][]. We'll probably hear <foes.plural> before we see them at this rate.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_coward=Maybeâ€” Ooh.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_coward=That's an awfully pretty patch of flowers to be in a gloomy place like this.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish.80:Peculiar/Funny> shape they're in, now that you mention it...
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_coward=It's not just me, right? That's a giant flowering footprint?
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_bookish=This rings a bell. I remember a drawing of this very clearly, but the context is...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_bookish=Gimme a minute...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_coward=What was that??
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_action=*WHOOM* *WHOOM*
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_coward=There's something moving through the forest. Something... huge.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_actionSmall=*caw*
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_actionSmall=*caw*
~01~prompt~panel_012~3_bookish=((THOOM!))
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_leader=Hang on. We're near <site>, right? Oh no...
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_leader=The Strider of <site>!
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hothead=...What?
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_leader=A giant of terrible beauty, dooming those who look upon it.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_hothead=And you're just remembering this now?
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_coward=Did you say "doom"?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hothead=Well, now I've [i]gotta[]know what this thing is.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_coward=It's not what we're looking for. Let's get out of here!
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_bookish=Wait a minute. Now I remember where I saw those flowers!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_npc=<hothead.romantic/leader/snark/goofball/bookish/60:Come on, why'd you become an adventurer, if not for the occasional doom?/Come on, why'd you become an adventurer, if not for the occasional doom?/A little doom's never been a problem before./Psh, we eat doom for breakfast./Come on, aren't you a [i]little[] curious?/We're not afraid of stompy things and mist! Come on!>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~2_coward=Are you sure we should go chasing after whatever was huge enough to make that print?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_coward=<hothead.romantic/leader/snark/goofball/bookish/60:I ask myself that some days./I ask myself that some days./Yeah, but, there's doom and then there's [b][i]doom...[][]/Yeah, but, there's doom and then there's [b][i]doom...[][]/Not really./Stomping and mist are fine. It's more the "doom" part.>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_npc=This would be easier if I could see more than ten feet in front of my face.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_actionLarge=[green]*WHOOM*
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~2_bookish=[neutralAspect]<foes.cdgmt:Rroaggh!/Kgraakh!/Graaowgh!/Skrrrzzt!/Skriiiiyk!>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~3_actionSmall=*rustle*
~05~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_npc=The Strider!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_006~2_leader=The <foes.plural>!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_010~1_npc=[green]Shwooofff
~05~player_chose_one~panel_013~1_action=[green]Come to me, brave one.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_016~1_actionSmall=creeeaak...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_017~1_hothead=[green]WHOOOM
~05~player_chose_one~panel_018~1_bookish=FfffsshhhhOOM
~05~player_chose_one~panel_019~1_leader=They're close! Get ready!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_020~1_coward=What's on your face?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_020~2_hothead=Doom.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_coward=I want no part of whatever made those footprints.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_speech=Fine. <foes.plural> are exciting too, I guess.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_speech=We need to get these blooms brewed into a tea immediately!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_bookish=They can wait. These are Ivoryxia, and they'll only stay potent for a short time.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~2_hothead=What about the Strider?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~3_leader=What about the [i]<foes.plural>?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_bookish=Fresh Ivoryxia, when brewed, bestows heightened strength and reflexes for a few hours.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_leader=Now you're talkin'!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_bookish=Occupational hazards, I'd imagine. You saw the size of that footprint.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~2_hothead=So, tell me again why we're not farming this stuff?
