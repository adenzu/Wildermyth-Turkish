~01~prompt~panel_001~1_leader=As the light is fading...
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_leader=Everybody stay sharp. The Thrixl have had plenty of time here to weave their webs. Brush a strand, and you'll see what they want you to see.
~01~prompt~panel_002.(target2_is_poet)~1_target2=I've never met a darker foe. It's one thing to fight with a blade in the daylight or even a knife in the dark, but Thrixl change the ground under your—
~01~prompt~panel_003.(target2_is_bookish)~1_target2=If only we could learn more about how their illusions work, we might be able to develop a method for—
~01~prompt~panel_004.(target2_is_goofball)~1_target2=[i][b] I [][]can't find my way around my head half the time, so how are [i][b]they[][] going to? Maybe I can mire them down! Come on in, insects, the water's [i][b]fiiine!
~01~prompt~panel_004.(target2_is_goofball)~2_leader=Stop that!
~01~prompt~panel_004.(target2_is_goofball)~3_speech=Oh for crying out loud, <leader>, it was just a—
~01~prompt~panel_005.(target2_NOT_poet/bookish/goofball_(60))~1_target2=We've never faced a more dangerous foe -- but neither have they, you know?
~01~prompt~panel_005.(target2_NOT_poet/bookish/goofball_(60))~2_leader=What?
~01~prompt~panel_005.(target2_NOT_poet/bookish/goofball_(60))~3_speech=I think the bonds that link <company> are at least as strong as anything the Thrixl can—

~01~prompt~panel_010~1_thought=You see what they want you to see...you see what they want you to see...

~01~prompt~panel_010~4_speech=[b][i] ANYBODY??
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_thought=You see what they want you to see...you see what they want you to see...
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_speech=And you hear it and smell it too, apparently.
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_speech=I've traveled so far, in so many ways, but I'll never forget that night...
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_target=But I'm not there now. I'm in a Thrixl illusion now.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_target=It's a logic puzzle. If I look carefully, I'll see what isn't real.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_narration=<target.eventRoll:roll_one|difficulty_one>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_target=<target2> is the path that will lead me home.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_narration=<target.eventRoll:roll_one|difficulty_two>
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_target=I know the natural world too intimately to be fooled.
~05~choice_four~panel_001~1_target=...This is not your fate.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~1_target=For starters, I'm older than I was then.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~2_speech=If I was [i]really[] back here, <target.maimal:I'd still have my arm. / I'd still have my leg. /I'd still have the old haircut.>
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_002~1_target=And the fire wouldn't be coming toward me.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_003~1_target=I mean, that's a nice trick, and I definitely feel threatened, but that's not how it happened. The wind blew the flames toward the town center, not the outskirts.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_004~1_target=There are no real flames in front of me.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_005~1_target=If I walk forward, I won't walk into flames.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_006~1_target=I'll walk into <leader>. <Leader.mf:He was/She was/They were> right behind me the moment before this started.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_007~1_target=I'll run straight into <leader.mf:him/her/them>, and then I'll open my eyes, and then I see what's really there.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_007~2_speech=Not what they want me to see.
~06~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_009~1_leader=<target.mf:He's/She's/They're> snapped out of it! <target.mf:He's/She's/They're> back with us!

~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_001~1_target=For starters, that wasn't the color of the thatching on the roofs.
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_001~2_speech=....or was it?
~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_002~1_target=And our foes came from the north side of town, not the west...

~07~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_004~1_target=This isn't real!

~08~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_001~1_target=This town isn't real. Those flames moving toward me are also not real.
~08~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_001~2_speech=...disconcerting, but not real...

~10~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_target=You stupid insects think this will work on me?
~10~player_chose_three~panel_001~2_target=On [i][b]ME??[][]
~10~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_target=I've spent my life in the natural world, not the world built by women and men!
~10~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_target=Maybe you could fool most people with this cheap imitation, but that's because most people don't [i][b]look[][] at the world around them!
~10~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_target=I look!
~10~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_target=The thatching on the roofs was golden, not brown.
~10~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_target=The flames blew toward the center of town, not toward the outskirts!
~10~player_chose_three~panel_007~1_target=This illusion looks realistic... it smells realistic... it sounds realistic... but realistic isn't real! This isn't—

~11~player_chose_four~panel_001~1_target=Who said that???
~11~player_chose_four~panel_002~1_target=Does it matter?

~11~player_chose_four~panel_010~1_leader=What just happened?
~11~player_chose_four~panel_011~1_target=The Thrixl had my mind for a moment. But I'm back now.
