Time for camp, <rival>." They're very convincing. Shall we?/We're getting close, and I'm not up for any fighting tonight. How about we pack it in?/Anybody else ready to set up camp? <leader>, pick a spot!>
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_leader=That clearing looks <leader.bookish/romantic/60:more than sufficient/lovely in the twilight/just fine>.

~01~prompt~panel_007~1_coward=Everybody saw that, right?
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_leader=Yes.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_coward=Good. ...Or bad? Does that make it more or less concerning?
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_rival=<rival.poet/romantic/hothead/80:Just little drifters, having an evening drift./I thought they were pretty./They didn't hurt anybody. And they're gone now./I don't know, they seemed harmless.>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_rival=<rival.poet/romantic/hothead/80:I could drift off to sleep, come to think of it. Are we still camping?/I wouldn't mind them keeping watch while we sleep. Speaking of which, are we still sleeping here?/[i]And[] I'd rather not hike anymore tonight. Shall we pack it in?/So... camp?>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_coward=<coward.coward.80:[face:scared]/[face:skeptical]>After seeing that?
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_coward=You're... wait, are you joking? I have trouble telling if <rival>'s joking.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_narration=Later...
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_coward=<coward.coward.80:[face:scared]/[face:grim]>I can't believe <rival.mf:he wasn't,she wasn't, they weren't> joking.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_coward=<coward.bookish/coward/80:I wanted to inspect the area, in case there was a chance of the green shapes returning./No, I... just, um. I figure someone should be watching.

~01~prompt~panel_023~1_speech=[darkGreen]My messengers do not lie. Mortals sleep within my wood.
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_coward=<coward.coward.80:[face:scared]/[face:skeptical]>Is that... bad?
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_speech=[darkGreen]There is no good or bad. Only law.
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_speech=[darkGreen]And law states that a mortal who sleeps in this place shall [b]bear my mark.[] As they sleep within my realm, I may sleep within theirs.
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_coward=I knew something was off, I knew it. And...
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_coward=I won't flinch.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=[white]Transformation—[pink]<coward>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_coward=Now hang on a minute. I'm not the one who's [i]sleeping.[]
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=[white]Transformation—[orange]<rival>
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_coward=You're not marking anyone.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_actionSmall=[lightYellow](flinch)
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_coward=Is that... Am I marked?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_coward=That's not so bad.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_speech=[darkGreen]There is no good or bad.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_speech=[darkGreen]Only law.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_narration=The next morning...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~2_coward=...and then I got [i]marked[] by the spirit.  So I believe you have something to say to me.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_coward=Come on.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_010~1_rival=Okay. Fine.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_011~1_rival=Your hair looks good.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_011~2_rival=Happy now?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_coward="Any mortal who sleeps?"
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_coward=If you follow the letter of your own law, you'll leave me be.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~2_coward=Feel free to mark <rival> though, <rival.mf:he's,she's,they're> [i]fast[] asleep.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~3_actionSmall=Zzzzz

~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_coward=Oh wow, it's actually going to... huh.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_narration=The next morning...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006~2_rival=...But, you were up. Did you see anything? What happened?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_coward=I have absolutely no idea.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_coward=<coward.goofball/snark/hothead/poet/bookish/healer/60:So you can... um. Go away./Get outta here. Shoo./Get outta here. Shoo./Leave us in peace./Leave us in peace./We'll be out of here tomorrow. Leave us in peace./So you can, um. Leave.>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_speech=[darkGreen]The law states—

~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_coward=<coward.bookish/poet/romantic/goofball/snark/60:Because/For example,/For example,/Listen./Listen./Listen.> I've got friends over there, and we're going to be hunting down <foes.plural> tomorrow.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_coward=But if you want, I can wake them up now.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_coward=And you don't look as <coward.bookish.80:difficult/tough> to take down as a <foes.singular>.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_008~2_speech=[darkGreen]Pheh.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_009~1_speech=[darkGreen]A curse for impudence.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_009~2_speech=[darkGreen][i]A curse for your bellies!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_010.(coward_is_coward)~1_coward=Phhhwuh! I can't believe my spine held through that!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_011.(coward_is_bookish)~1_coward=That certainly could have gone worse.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_012.(coward_is_loner)~1_coward=Let's hope the rest of the night stays quiet.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_013.(coward_NOT_coward/bookish/loner_(80))~1_coward=I feel like I got lucky there.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_014~1_coward=[blue]*gurgle*
~07~player_chose_three~panel_015~1_narration=The next morning...
~07~player_chose_three~panel_015~2_rival=Rgh. My gut feels like it's trying to crawl up my neck.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_015~3_actionSmall=Ugggh...
~07~player_chose_three~panel_015~4_coward=Maybe... nerves?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_016~1_rival=Or maybe <coward> didn't prepare the potatoes properly. [i]Who knows.[]
~07~player_chose_three~panel_016~2_coward=The world is full of mysteries.
