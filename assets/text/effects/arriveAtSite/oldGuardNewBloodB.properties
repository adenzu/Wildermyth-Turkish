~01~prompt~panel_001~1_coward=If <site> is down below that drop-off ahead...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_coward=<coward.coward/bookish/loner:I’m thinking that it’d be safest to keep watch from up there for the next few hours, just to be sure of what we’re getting ourselves into./It’d probably be a good idea to keep watch from up there for a few hours, so that we can be more certain of the enemy count./I can keep watch from up there for a few hours. Make sure we’ve got a good grasp of the place.>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hothead=How different do you think it’s going to be from all the other clumps of <foes.plural> that we fight?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_coward=A good pair of eyes can be a valuable weapon.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hothead=I'll pocket that little proverb. Even so, we’re as prepared as we’re going to be.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hothead=<hero3>, you prepared?
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_hero3=Sure.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hothead=<hothead.greedy/leader/hothead:<hero3>'s  prepared./<hero3>'s  prepared./<hero3>'s prepared.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_hothead=I don't see a problem.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_coward=It’s not a problem so much as the [i]avoidance[] of problems.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hothead=Back in the early days, <hothead.hothead/snark/greedy:there was more of a fire in this company. We burned hot, lean and mean. We had to, or <foes.plural> would have spread like locusts./things were simple. “Find some <foes.plural>. Kill some <foes.plural>.” That was all the strategy we needed./we had that go-get. We had to have it, because no one else did.>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hothead=It was just a few green fighters against a terrifying mystery of a foe. But we prevailed, so far anyway.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hero3=Let’s not drag it out, <hero3.rfln.coward:alright, <coward>?/eh <coward>?/eh love?/eh, <coward>?>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hero3=<coward> is willing to do some observation. Let <coward.mf:him/her/them>.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_hero3=<hero3.rfln.hothead:Even with ol' <hothead> along, we’ve got a good track record./<foes.cdgmt:Destroying Deepists/Destroying Drauven/Gutting Gorgons/Mauling Morthagi/Throwing Thrixl at the wall> is something we’ve become rather skilled at./<hothead>’s <hothead.whm:a powerhouse/a lightning bolt/a magical powerhouse> on the battlefield, you’re incredibly experienced, even I can hold my own./<foes.cdgmt:Destroying Deepists/Destroying Drauven/Gutting Gorgons/Mauling Morthagi/Throwing Thrixl at the wall> is something we’ve become rather skilled at.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_hero3=Plus, the longer we wait, the more likely they are to notice us.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_hothead=Right. Element of surprise. That's the phrase I was reaching for.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_coward=Let's hope it's not the wrong kind of surprise.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hero3=<hero3.rfln.coward:I’m not agreeing with <coward>, mind you, just with the idea itself./<coward.pcfn.hothead:--/I know you’re probably used to being the one imparting wisdom to <coward>, but a younger <coward.mf:buck/doe/pup> isn’t necessarily wrong./Just because <coward>’s a younger <coward.mf:buck/doe/pup> than you doesn’t mean <coward.mf:he’s/she’s/they’re> necessarily wrong./Just because <coward>’s a younger <coward.mf:buck/doe/pup> than you doesn’t mean <coward.mf:he’s/she’s/they’re> necessarily wrong.>/I’m not agreeing with <coward.mf:him/her/them> just because it’s <coward>, you know./<coward.pcfn.hothead:--/I know you’re probably used to being the one imparting wisdom to <coward>, but a younger <coward.mf:buck/doe/pup> isn’t necessarily wrong./Just because <coward>’s a younger <coward.mf:buck/doe/pup> than you doesn’t mean <coward.mf:he’s/she’s/they’re> necessarily wrong./Just because <coward>’s a younger <coward.mf:buck/doe/pup> than you doesn’t mean <coward.mf:he’s/she’s/they’re> necessarily wrong.>>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_hero3=How often have we regretted taking a little more time?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_hothead=One hour, <coward.mf:buck/doe/pup>.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_coward=Two?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_hothead=One and a half.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_coward=Okay.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_narration=Later...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_coward=Right, then.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_010~2_hothead=Feeling good?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~1_coward=Good enough. They've got their backs exposed. If we can take advantage of that, the fight may fall in our favor today.
