~01~prompt~panel_001~1_goofball=Is that <loner> up there?
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_leader=Yeah, looks like <loner.mf:he's/she's/they're> coming back.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_loner=Hey. It's just like <hook> said. <town> is just over the hill there.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_leader=Time for a few pints and a hot meal!
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook=This is a waste of time. We still have a few hours of daylight. We should press on.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_goofball=Aw.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_leader=We've been traveling a lot lately. We could all use the break.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_goofball=Whooohoo!
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_leader=Tomorrow we fight, but tonight, we drink! Come on, I'm buying the first round!
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=You all go on ahead without me. I don't feel like pubbing it tonight.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_goofball=You know what, I'll catch up to you later.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_goofball=Hey, how about you help me with that leg sweep move?
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_goofball=What's wrong with you?
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_goofball=Maaaaybe I should give <hook.mf:him/her/them> some space.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_hook=You mean The Sweeping Swallow?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_goofball=Oh, it's not just called the Drop Down Spinny Leg Sweep Thing?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_hook=I spent a fair amount of time perfecting it.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_goofball=Weeping Willow! I got it!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~2_hook=The least you could do is get the name right.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_hook=You don't have to stay just to keep me company.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_goofball=Hey now, nailing this move could save my life some day.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~2_hook=That it could. And practicing can't hurt. Especially given how bad you were the last time you tried.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hook=Why does something have to be wrong with me? I just don't feel like it tonight.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_goofball=Well, sure. But you didn't feel like it the other night either.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_goofball=If I didn't know better, I'd think you were avoiding us.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_hook=It's not about you. I just don't need all that group bonding nonsense.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_goofball=We could find a dark corner of the tavern and skulk. We haven't had a proper skulking in weeks.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_goofball=Exactly! Probably a muttered curse here and there as well!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_hook=... like, with glowering and grimaces and everything?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_hook=... okay, but first round's on you.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_goofball=He--
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_goofball=Yeah! I'm gonna grab an ale and I'll be right over.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~2_leader=Hey, you made it! We have a table in the back.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_goofball=That I am!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~2_npc=Hey, you there. You're with <company>, right?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_goofball=We do, but <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> not with us tonight.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_006~2_npc=You lot run with that <hook> <hook.mf:fella/gal/person>, don'cha?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_007~1_npc=Good! <hook.mf:He/She/They> ain't allowed back in! Not after that fight with the Blackheart gang! I'm still sweeping up teeth from those poor sobs!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_008~1_goofball=<hook.mf:He/She/They> got into a fight here?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_008~2_npc=It wasn't no fight! It was a one sided tornado, knocking those brutes off their feet left and right! Two of 'em had to be carried out!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_009~1_npc2=Are you going on[b] again []about <hook>?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_010~1_npc=That lout! <hook.mf:He/She/They> --
~07~player_chose_three~panel_010~2_npc2=[b]<hook.mf:He/She/They>[] only got involved when they tried to get fresh with me!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_011~1_npc=I ... what? <hook.mf:He/She/They> did? I mean, THEY did?!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_011~2_npc2=[i]MmmHmmm.[] Came to my rescue, <hook.mf:he/she/they> did.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_012~1_npc=Uhm, you tell <hook> it's all right with me if <hook.mf:he comes/she comes/they come> back again.
