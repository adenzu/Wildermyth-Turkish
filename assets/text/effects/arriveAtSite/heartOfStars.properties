~01~prompt~panel_004~1_healer=<healer.healer/leader/goofball:Do you want some company, <hook>?/I'll join you, if you'd like some company./Mind if I come along? Happy to join.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_hook=<hook.hothead/healer/snark:... sure./Yeah, okay./Eh, why not.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_healer=<healer.goofball/leader/snark:Where we heading to, bud?/We got a destination tonight, <hook>?/You not get enough walking in today? Not that I mind a nighttime stroll ...>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook=Someone I used to know died on this day ...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=So each year, I light a candle for <hook.awm:her/him>.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_healer=<healer.hothead/healer/poet:That's a nice way to memorialize them./That's a real nice tribute, <hook>./I think anyone would like to be remembered that way.>

~01~prompt~panel_011~1_healer=No. You just learn to carry it more lightly.

~01~prompt~panel_013~1_healer=<healer.goofball/leader/snark:Huh, what's this?/Whoa! What have we here?/Uhmmmm, what's that?>
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_hook=<hook.leader/hothead/bookish:Some sort of shrine?/Looks like a shrine./Seems to be a shrine!>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hook=This would be a perfect place for the candle.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hook=This looks like a sacred place, let's find something else.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_narration=<hook> kneels, setting the candle on the shrine.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_healer=Uhm, <hook>?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_narration=And, just as suddenly as it appeared, it's gone once more.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_narration=They move on, until ...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_hook=<hook.romantic/leader/poet:I think there's a clearing up ahead./We're coming up on a clearing./Looks to be a clearing up ahead.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_healer=<healer.goofball/romantic/poet:Wow, this is beautiful./This is breathtaking. Wow./Whoa, this is ... astonishing.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~2_hook=<hook.hothead/snark/romantic:Yes. This is the place./Couldn't have found a better place./<hook.awm:She/He> would have loved this.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hook=This is perfect. <hook.romantic/goofball/snark/60:There's the constellation of The Crown of Alethea, <hook.awm:her/his> favorite!/And look! It's the constellation of the Lovers. One of <hook.awm:her/his> favorites./And there's <hook.awm:her/his> favorite constellation, the Tumbling Ox./Why, I'll be damned if that isn't the Petite Sloth. <hook.awm:Her/His> favorite constellation.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_hook=<hook.hothead/snark/60:These rocks should do./Well hello there, perfectly placed rocks./And moss covered rocks? That'll do.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_hook=<hook.romantic/poet/healer/60:Sometimes my chest hurts, I miss <hook.awm:her/him> so much./Missing <hook.awm:her/him> is almost overwhelming sometimes./Missing <hook.awm:her/him> is like a wound that never heals./I really miss <hook.awm:her/him>.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_healer=<healer.healer/bookish/60:Why don't you tell me a bit about <hook.awm:her/him>?/Care to share some stories about <hook.awm:her/him>?/How about you tell me about <hook.awm:her/him>?>

~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_healer=<healer.healer/romantic/60:Yeah, <hook.awm:she/he> sounds like <hook.awm:she/he> was really important to you./Yeah. I'd love to know more about someone who could have such a special place in your heart./Yeah. Then <hook.awm:her/his> memory could be a part of me, too.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_narration=<hook> talked late into the night, sometimes through tears, sometimes along with laughter. As the candle burned down, the stars traced their ancient path across the sky, and a new tradition between the two of them was born.
