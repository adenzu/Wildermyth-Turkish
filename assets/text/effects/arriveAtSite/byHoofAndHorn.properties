~01~prompt~panel_001~1_bookish=<bookish.coward/bookish/poet/60:The shadows here are so thick. Anything could be hiding behind these trees ... /I've read about forests like these. /This forest is heavy with shadow./This is the densest forest I've ever seen. How old is this place, I wonder.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_coward=The trees are so thick, even the noon-day sun can't reach the ground.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_bookish=We haven't seen a single living thing, but I can't shake the feeling that we're being wa --
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_speech=Shhh!
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_coward=I see someone!
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_coward=Hide!
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_bookish=<bookish.leader/hothead/60:<npc.mf:He doesn't/She doesn't/They don't> seem that dangerous. /It's one of <npc.mf:him/her/them> against us. No contest. Hmmm./<npc.mf:He looks/She looks/They look> sad.> Maybe <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> lost.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_bookish=Hello? Are you lost?
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_npc=AHH!
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_npc=Sorry! Sorry. You scared the life nearly out of me!
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_npc=What are you[b] doing[] here?!
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_bookish=<coward.hothead/snark/60:We ask the questions around here! /Oh, you know, just out for a walk in your every day super creepy forest./We could ask the same of you!>
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_coward=We're hunting the horned monsters that live here.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_npc=I ... I suppose we are here for the same thing then.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_bookish=You came by yourself to kill these vermin?
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_npc=They're not vermin!
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_npc=Or, they weren't always this way. <npc.romantic/snark/60:They ... they were people once.  And one of them ... one of them was the love of my life./They might be lower than vermin now, but they were people once. And one of them was my ball and chain./They ... they were people once.  And one of them ... one of them was once my <npc.awm:wife/husband>.>
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_coward=<coward.coward/bookish/romantic/60:What evil sorcery is it that can turn a normal person into such monsters?!/Some foul sorcery turned <npc.awm:her/him> into a monster?/Your beloved was stolen from you by evil sorcery?!/Evil sorcery stole your <npc.awm:wife/husband> away?>
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_npc=No sorcery. Just words. Evil, slippery words. <npc.poet/romantic/hothead/60:Disgusting promises of power and taunts of hidden treasures beneath the earth./Words that meant more to <npc.awm:her/him> than our marriage, apparently./Words I'd like to shove down someone's throat!/Words that filled <npc.awm:her/his> mind with dark thoughts and wicked cravings.>
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_npc=I ... I ... <npc.awm:she/he>'s too far gone now, my <npc.awm:wife/husband>. The last time I saw <npc.awm:her/him>, all that was left in <npc.awm:her/his> eyes was some primal rage that terrified me. <npc.coward/snark/romantic/60: So ... I suppose there's a monster in <npc.awm:her/him> instead of the <npc.awm:woman/man> I knew./I always called <npc.awm:her/him> a beast, but I didn't think <npc.awm:she'd/he'd> become one./I'd give anything to have <npc.awm:her/him> look at me in that special way only <npc.awm:she/he> had./The person I knew is gone.>
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_npc=<npc.coward/leader/hothead/60:Oh, the things <npc.awm:she/he>'s done now. I should have killed <npc.awm:her/him> then, but I was weak and I let my emotions stay my blade./Oh, the things <npc.awm:she/he>'s done now. I should have killed <npc.awm:her/him> then. Who knows what horrors <npc.awm:she/he> has done since./I hesitated when I should have struck <npc.awm:her/him> down!  Who knows what <npc.awm:she/he> has done since!/I wish I'd had the strength to strike <npc.awm:her/him> down there and then. But ... I couldn't.>
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_npc=I am here to end this.\n ... Before <npc.awm:she/he> can hurt anyone else.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_bookish=Join us. We will do this task together.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_coward=Let us handle this. You shouldn't have to be involved.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_npc=I thank you for your offer. Truly, I was not sure how I was going to manage this on my own.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_npc=I ... thank you for sparing me this task. I think my conviction would fail me again at the end.
