~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=At long last, the heroes have reached <site>...
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_leader=<leader.leader/loner/healer/poet/80:\nLook sharp, everyone! We know the <foes.plural> are somewhere in <overlandTile.bghps:this forest/these fields/these hills/this forest/this swamp>.../\nSpread out, everyone! We know the <foes.plural> are somewhere in <overlandTile.bghps:this forest/these fields/these hills/this forest/this swamp>.../\nBe careful, everyone! We know the <foes.plural> are somewhere in <overlandTile.bghps:this forest/these fields/these hills/this forest/this swamp>.../\nDon't let the majesty of <overlandTile.bghps:this forest/these fields/these hills/this forest/this swamp> distract you. We know the <foes.plural> are nearby.../\nFinally, we're here! We know the <foes.plural> are somewhere in <overlandTile.bghps:this forest/these fields/these hills/this forest/this swamp>...>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_volunteer=I bet they're lurking underground in some hidden cave system. <volunteer.bookish/coward/goofball/snark/80:It's their typical habitat./Just under our feet, waiting to pounce.../What is it with <foes> and caves?/Y'know. Again./They love those.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hero=[b][i]Somewhere[][]? They're probably lurking just <overlandTile.bghps:behind those trees/beyond those rocks/over that ridge/behind those pines/inside that patch of reeds>. <hero.hothead/goofball/snark/80:I say we charge 'em!/That's where I'd lurk./Tell me I'm wrong./Perfect ambush spot.>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hero=You [b][i]bet[][], do you...?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hero=All right. Let's bet on it!
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_volunteer=Huh? Bet on [b][i]what[][]?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_leader=That... that is [b][i]so[][] irresponsible right now--
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_hero=On where the <foes.plural> come at us from! If they come <overlandTile.bghps:from the trees/around the rocks/over the ridge/from the pines/out of the reeds>, I win. If they come from underground, [b][i]you[][] win.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hero=Oh, forget <leader.mf:him/her/them>. <hero.hothead/goofball/greedy/snark/80:Unless you don't have the [b][i]guts[][]?/Where's the harm?/There's money on the table./<leader.mf:He/She/They> just <leader.mf:wants/wants/want> in on the action.../Whaddaya say?>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_volunteer=No takers.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_volunteer=You're on!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_hero=<volunteer.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/snark/80:\nSpoilsport./Chicken./Buzzkill./Fair./Jerk./Spoilsport.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~2_volunteer=<Leader> is right. <volunteer.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/snark/80:It would be inappropriate to wager at a time like this. Let's maintain our focus on the task ahead./What if we get distracted and the <foes.plural> catch us by surprise?/This is no time for goofing around--and if [b][i]I'm[][] saying that, you know it's true./Besides, I don't need your gold. I'll do fine looting the <foes.singular> lair when we're done.../This is no time for games. We've got <foes.plural> to deal with. You [b][i]do[][] remember the <foes.plural>, right?/Let's keep our eyes open instead of getting caught up in some bet.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_leader=Here they come! Get ready...
