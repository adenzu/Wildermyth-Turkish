~01~prompt~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.healer/leader/60:Keep your eyes peeled and your mind sharp. / Everyone stay close. The Thrixl could be anywhere./Eyes sharp, group.> If you start feeling weird or sleepy, fall back and let us know.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_loner=<loner.bookish/coward/greedy/60:I wonder if these are the ruins that <npc> mentioned in -- /This place is creepy./I wonder what treasures these ruins might hold .../This place looks ancient.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_loner=What was that?
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_leader=What was what?
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_loner=I ... I thought I saw something.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_loner=I guess it was nothing.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_leader=Maybe, maybe not. Thrixl delight in mind games. Stay vigilant.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_loner=<loner.hothead/snark/60:Don't have to tell me twice./Of course. Not like I was going to take a nap./That I will.>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_loner=I keep seeing something ... shapes ... just on the edge of my view.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_healer=<healer.healer/snark/coward/60:Are you okay, <loner>?/You've almost got me wanting to run for the hills, <loner>. You all right?/You okay, <loner>? You're making me nervous .../What's with the jumpiness, <loner>? You okay?>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_loner=<loner.loner/hothead/healer/60:Get a grip, <loner>. It's just the Thrixl messing with you!/This infernal place! And these infernal Thrixl!/Get a grip, <loner>! You're making everyone else jumpy!/I need to focus and stop jumping at every falling pebble.>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_loner=Yeah, I'm okay. It's just ... I hate the idea that these creatures can get into our heads.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_loner=It's ... just such an invasion. I don't want to be alone with my thoughts sometimes, but they're [b]MY []thoughts.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.healer/leader/poet/60:I'm with you <loner>. No one should suffer what these creatures can do./Being alert is wise here, <loner>./"He who throws caution to the wind may get blown over by the storm."/You might not be jumping at nothing, <loner>.>
~03~choice_three~panel_001~1_leader=<loner>, try to focus. You're making the rest of us skittish now.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.healer/leader/poet:That's why our job here is so important. Let's find these creatures and put an end to them!/We're here to keep these creatures from doing this to anyone else.  Stay on your guard, but be ready, not worried./It's wise to be alert and concerned, but don't let fear creep into your heart, <loner>.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_loner=Thanks, <leader>. I'll aim for vigilant and focused instead of nervous and jumpy.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_001~1_loner=I ... I guess you're right. It's probably nothing.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_002~1_loner=Focus, <loner>.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_003~1_loner=Deep breath in, deep breath out.
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_004~1_loner=My mind is my [b]OWN[].
~05~player_chose_three.test_pass~panel_005~1_loner=That's better.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_001~1_loner=I ... I guess you're right. It's probably nothing.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_002~1_loner=I need to focu -- what was that?!
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_003~1_healer=What <loner.mf:does he/does she/do they> keep seeing? Where are they?!
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_004~1_leader=Are you two coming?
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_004~2_loner=Yeah, I ... yeah.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~1_healer=What was that!?!
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_005~2_leader=AHH! What?! Wha -- *sigh* You two need to stop jumping at every falling pebble!
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_006~1_loner=You said to tell you if I felt weird. WELL I FEEL WEIRD! THEY'RE OUT THERE!
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_006~2_leader=You're jumping at shadows! I didn't say to --
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_007~1_loner=Did you hear that?
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_008~1_healer=While you two were bickering ... they surrounded us!
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_008~2_loner=[b][i]Told you [][]they were here.
~06~player_chose_three.test_fail~panel_008~3_leader=Oh for - let's just do this.
