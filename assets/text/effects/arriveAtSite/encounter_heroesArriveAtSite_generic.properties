.longName=Assault <site>!
.name=Assault!
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_003.(coward_is_bookish_>_60)~1_coward=Have you ever heard the tale of the two wanderers that died because they strayed too far from their friends?
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_004.(coward_is_bookish_>_60).(hero_is_bookish_>_60)~1_hero=Are you referring to Crallhard's Wanderers? I read that as soon as you put it down.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_005.(coward_is_bookish_>_60).(hero_is_bookish_>_60)~1_hero=They made exceptionally bad choices. I think we'll do a little better than them.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_006.(coward_is_bookish_>_60).(hero_NOT_bookish)~1_hero=No, I haven't.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_007.(coward_is_bookish_>_60).(hero_NOT_bookish)~1_hero=Nor do I think it has any bearing on the outcome of this battle.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_008.(coward_is_snark_>_60)~1_coward=I must say, <hero>, going to fight <foes.plural> with just the two of us and no backup seems like an entirely foolproof plan.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_009.(coward_is_snark_>_60).(hero_is_hothead)~1_hero=What's life without a little danger, eh?
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_010.(coward_is_snark_>_60).(hero_is_hothead)~1_hero=A foolproof plan would be no fun at all.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_011.(coward_is_snark_>_60).(hero_is_leader)~1_hero=No plan is ever foolproof.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_012.(coward_is_snark_>_60).(hero_is_leader)~1_hero=That's the risk we take on with this line of work.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_013.(coward_is_snark_>_60).(hero_is_goofball_>_60)~1_hero=[i]Foolproof?[]
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_014.(coward_is_snark_>_60).(hero_is_goofball_>_60)~1_hero=My dear <coward.mf:fellow/lady/fellow>, if it were foolproof, I wouldn't have been able to come along!
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_015.(coward_is_snark_>_60).(hero_is_poet_>_60)~1_hero=There are none but fools who believe a plan to be foolproof.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_016.(coward_is_snark_>_60).(hero_is_poet_>_60)~1_hero=Plans are so often lead astray by the will of the lands that they may as well be called wishes.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_017.(coward_is_greedy)~1_coward=So, I want to take out a <foes.singular> infestation as much as the next <coward.mf:guy/gal/person>, but isn't it a bit dangerous with just the two of us?
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_018.(coward_is_greedy).(hero_is_greedy_>_60)~1_hero=You're going to let a few <foes.plural> come between us and a stash of treasure?
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_019.(coward_is_greedy).(hero_is_greedy_>_60)~1_hero=<coward.greedy.60:And here I was thinking I had you figured out./What's life without a bit of risk, eh?>
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_020.(coward_is_greedy).(hero_is_leader)~1_hero=There's always danger. Even when we are all together.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_021.(coward_is_greedy).(hero_is_leader)~1_hero=We have a job to do, and we have to do it regardless of the circumstance.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_022.(coward_is_greedy).(hero_is_goofball)~1_hero=Dangerous? Maybe.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_023.(coward_is_greedy).(hero_is_goofball)~1_hero=But it'll be a great story to tell when we get back.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_024.(coward_is_greedy).(hero_is_poet_>_60)~1_hero=The lands are sick. Sometimes, we need to spread ourselves thin to cover ground quickly.
~02~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesArePresent~panel_025.(coward_is_greedy).(hero_is_poet_>_60)~1_hero=Time doesn't wait for those who saunter.
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_003.(coward_is_bookish)~1_coward=There have been many books written about those who wander off alone. Let's hope this one has a good ending.
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_004.(coward_is_coward)~1_coward=This may have been a bad idea.
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_005.(coward_is_goofball)~1_coward=Let's see if those <foes.plural> can survive my merciless wit without my teammates there to bear the brunt of it.
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_006.(coward_is_healer)~1_coward=It's time to take back this land. The <foes.plural> have kept it from its people for long enough.
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_007.(coward_is_hothead)~1_coward=These <foes.plural> are really starting to get on my nerves.
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_008.(coward_is_leader)~1_coward=It feels strange being here alone. Still, the <foes.plural> aren't going to wipe themselves out.
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_009.(coward_is_loner)~1_coward=Solitude. Oh, how I've missed you.
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_010.(coward_is_greedy)~1_coward=I swear, I'm not sharing [i]anything[] I get outta these <foes.plural> with the others.
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_011.(coward_is_poet)~1_coward=And so <coward.mf:he/she/they> walked, and so too weighed the deed upon <coward.mf:his/her/their> shoulders.
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_012.(coward_is_romantic)~1_coward=<ship.exists:I wonder if <ship> and I could go somewhere together after this./I wonder if I'll find any nice <coward.awm:lass/lad> to rescue here.>
~03~rolesAreNotPresent.rolesAreNotPresent~panel_013.(coward_is_snark)~1_coward=It would save me a lot of walking if these <foes.plural> just came to us for their thwacking.
