~01~prompt~panel_001~1_goofball=I can't believe we get to explore an honest-to-goodness wizard's tower!
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_rival=<rival.bookish/healer/snark/hothead/60:I too am eager to learn more about magic in the Yondering Lands, but there's a rather large host of foes that needs defeating first.../ Your enthusiasm is, ah, commendable, but perhaps we should first give our attention to the host of foes awaiting us?/ Because we should totally do that first. The host of foes out there will wait upon <Goofball>'s convenience. / There'll be plenty of time to look around later! We have a battle to fight!/We can explore it after the battle. Let's get going.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_goofball=Ooh, I wonder what--
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_rival=Hey, don't touch that!
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_goofball=Oh come on, you're such a worrywart! I was just looking at it!
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_rival=<rival.snark.60:Yeah, "looking," with the eyes on the ends of your fingers. You were touching it. And you know why you shouldn't have been touching it? / No, you weren't. You were touching it. And you shouldn't have been touching it. You know why?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_goofball=No, why? Because I disturbed the pretty pattern?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_goofball=<rival.hothead.60:[i][b]Because this table is now suddenly at head height!!![][]/<goofball>, turn your head, look at the height of the table, and then see if you can answer your own question.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_goofball=Oh.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_goofball=[i][b]Oh.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_goofball=[i][b]Oh crap.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_goofball=Well, um, at least we've stopped shrinking?
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_rival=<rival.bookish/healer/snark/hothead/60:<goofball>, we are in a hostile site. Being four inches high will noticeably reduce our effectiveness on the battlefield. /<goofball>, we are in a hostile site. Our friends are counting on us to support them in the upcoming battle! /That's it?! That's all you've got?!/ We're in a hostile site! We have a battle to fight out there! / <goofball>, we are in a [i]hostile site.[] We have [i]foes[] we need to [i] vanquish.[]>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_rival=<rival.bookish/healer/snark/hothead/60: And taking both of us out of the equation before the battle begins greatly decreases the odds that -- / How exactly do you think we're going to do that when we're four inches high? / We're [b][i]four[][] frikkin' inches high because of you, and all you can say is "could be worse, could've been [b][i]three[][]"?!/ [i][b]We can't do that when we're four inches high![][] / How exactly do you think we're going to do that when we're four inches high?>
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hothead=Okay, okay. Well, uh...probably replacing the stone in the pattern will fix it? I'll just reverse what I did, and you should be touching my shoulder, like before. All we have to do is figure out how to get up there --
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_rival=Um. <goofball>? We have an, um. Bigger problem.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_rival=<goofball>, I swear, only you --
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_goofball=We can hide in that corner! It can't reach us there!
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_rival=Almost there --
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_actionSmall=squeak?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_rival=Scare it out of the corner! Then the cat will chase it and not us!
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_goofball=I'm not running another step! Fight the cat!
