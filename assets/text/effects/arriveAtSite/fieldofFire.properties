~01~prompt~panel_008~3_target=...It's not a place to hang your kettle.
~01~prompt~panel_008~4_narration=A gout of flame swirls amid these saber rocks. \nSilent, bright, and smokeless.

~01~prompt~panel_012~4_narration=<target> moves nearer to the spiraling inferno, apparently unscorched.
~01~prompt~panel_012~8_volunteer=<volunteer.pcfn.target:<target>/<target.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<target>/<target>>...!
~01~prompt~panel_013~3_target=I remember one tall story. It's brief, it's for children. In early days, the sky's back was not so stiff. She bent and saw a handsome gray squirrel who'd climbed to the top of a redwood.
~01~prompt~panel_014~10_hero=You're getting really close...
~01~prompt~panel_014~9_volunteer=<target>.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_target=This squirrel, he chatted to her blithely: how he relished her stars and the Autumn wind, took comfort when she cast her cloudy hair; he thanked her for letting the sun thread through it. <target.healer/hothead/leader/romantic/poet:The squirrel spoke without guile, and it couldn't be helped: the young sky fell in love./Like all squirrels, he was a flattering rogue. The young sky loved him. Why wouldn't she?/Youthful and uncautious, and unused to such adoring words, she became drunk on them./The sky was young, then. She listened, rapturous with language, and was smitten./The sky was young, then. Her pride overgrew, watered with earnest praise.>
~01~prompt~panel_016~3_target=So when she watched him plant his forests, and watched the trees grow tall where he placed them, the sky thought to impress him by planting her own.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_target=A lightning arm, she gently lowered, and a great tree of scarlet was born. But it was a greedy tree. It grew and grew--and grew so large it consumed the forest the squirrel had planted.
~01~prompt~panel_018~3_target=And without time for a word--words took much longer to say, in those days--it swallowed the squirrel's body too.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_target=<target.healer/hothead/leader/romantic/poet:Seeing the world suffer, she summoned from the cosmic ice a healing rain. It was the first rain, and afterwards, she would often soak the world in it, for fear all might burn up like that poor intrepid squirrel./So the sky conjured water to wrestle down her tree of flame, and the first rain fell. And ever after, she would rain upon the world, cautious of the mighty power that'd burnt away the life of her unfortunate squirrel./Seeing this, the sky grieved, and grew in wisdom. Upon the wildfire she poured celestial waters--the first rain--and ever after, when she lowers her lightning, even in wrath, she bolsters the earth in rain, lest her anger run beyond its intended course./So the sky began to wail, a terrible gusting grief that left her face flushed dark. And the first rain was her tears, and the ocean filled with them. Ever after, thinking on the smile of that intrepid squirrel, she will weep, and the world will feel rain./Saddened, and seeing that her hubris had ruined the earth, she poured all the starwine from her great bowl, and it fell as rain, dousing the flames. Ever after, the rain will come when a wildfire somewhere might threaten to engulf the world.>
~01~prompt~panel_020~10_volunteer=What's that [i]mean?[]
~01~prompt~panel_020~3_target=That's the story I remember. And this [i]place[] remembers. It's a piece of here. Something left behind.
~01~prompt~panel_021~3_target=Stories of fire... you don't hear them? They leap and lick at my imagination. At this altar, once... People would gather and tell them.
~01~prompt~panel_022~3_target=But they're dead now. Those people are dead. The flame somehow endures.
~01~prompt~panel_023~3_target=Listen. I'm going to let it touch me.
~01~prompt~panel_023~7_volunteer=<volunteer.pcfn.target:<target.mf:Son,/Daughter,/My child,> please/<target.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<target>/<target>>, come away! You should be burning! How're you not?!

~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~13_target=It was weird, I could feel it calling out to me. A primal thing. It didn't feel [i]foreign[]. The opposite, really. It wasn't asking me for anything... the one asking... was me?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~2_target=And answering me were... voices. Dead voices. Stories still glowing like last night's coals.
