Have to remember to look in the morning./My thing's just... Sunsets happen every day. What is it you're looking at exactly? Because I've seen sunsets before. My eye gets kind of bored sometimes, doesn't yours?/You know... The seasonal birds. I admire their unity, their motion. They go in flocks, and find all they need wherever they fold their wings. An example to strive for, on these long journeys of ours.[face:talking]//The sky. Changing. It shocks you somehow.
