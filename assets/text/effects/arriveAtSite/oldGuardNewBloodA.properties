~01~prompt~panel_002~1_coward=<coward.coward/bookish/loner:I’m thinking that it’d be safest to keep watch from up there for the next few hours, just to be sure of what we’re getting ourselves into./It’d probably be a good idea to keep watch from up there for a few hours, so that we can be more certain of the enemy count./I can keep watch from up there for a few hours. Make sure we’ve got a good grasp of the place.>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hothead=How different do you think it’s going to be from all the other clumps of <foes.plural> that we fight?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_coward=<coward.human_eyepatch:At least one good eye/A good pair of eyes> is a hero's most valuable weapon.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hothead=Neat proverb. <hothead.leader/greedy/hothead:Even so, we’re as prepared as we’re going to be./Even so, we’re as prepared as we’re going to be. Unless there's some key fact I’m missing?/But my <hothead.weaponType> is <hothead.weaponType:sharp/sharp/hungry/sharp/taut/hungry/thirsty/thirsty/crackling/primed>, everyone else is prepared, what’s the problem?>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hothead=<hero3>, <hothead.greedy/leader/hothead:you feel prepared?/you feel prepared?/you prepared?>
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_hero3=Sure.

~01~prompt~panel_008~1_coward=Here’s the thing.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_coward=I got to be the fine aged wine you see before you by <coward.bookish/loner/coward:being thorough and methodical/pausing to think before I made declarations and <coward.weaponType:swung my <coward.weaponType> into things/swung my <coward.weaponType> into things/swung my <coward.weaponType> into things/stuck my spear into things/shot my bow at things/shot my crossbow at things/stuck my dagger into things/waved my wand at things/swung my staff at things/picked fights>/not taking chances with my own skin>.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_coward=When the price is a life or a limb, you choose your purchases with great care.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hothead=At the risk of missing opportunities, though?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hero3=Have more faith in us, <coward>.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hero3=I'd say <coward> knows what <coward.mf:he’s/she’s/they’re> talking about.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_hero3=<hero3.rfln.hothead:Even with ol' <hothead> along, we’ve got a good track record./<foes.cdgmt:Destroying Deepists/Destroying Drauven/Gutting Gorgons/Mauling Morthagi/Throwing Thrixl at the wall> is something we’ve become rather skilled at./<hothead>’s <hothead.whm:a powerhouse/a lightning bolt/a magical powerhouse> on the battlefield, you’re incredibly experienced, even I can hold my own./<foes.cdgmt:Destroying Deepists/Destroying Drauven/Gutting Gorgons/Mauling Morthagi/Throwing Thrixl at the wall> is something we’ve become rather skilled at.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_hero3=Plus, the longer we wait, the more likely they are to notice us.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_hothead=Right. Element of surprise. That's the phrase I was reaching for.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_coward=Let's hope it's not the wrong kind of surprise.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hero3=<hero3.krfln.coward:I’ve had a lifetime to learn that./As much as it pains me to admit it sometimes./I’ve had enough conversations with <coward.mf:him/her/them> to know./Not just <coward.mf:a  handsome/a pretty/an attractive> face, turns out./That’s the impression I’ve gotten, anyway.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hothead=Eh. It’s not a hill I need to die on.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_hothead=So to speak.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_hothead=If the extra hours would make [i]you[] feel better...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_narration=Later...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_hothead=<coward.mf:He’s/She’s/They’ve> been perched up there like some <coward.bookish/loner/coward:hard-eyed owl/grim gargoyle/mad squirrel> for a while now.

~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~1_coward=Right, then.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~2_hothead=Feeling good?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_012~1_coward=Good enough. They've got their backs exposed. If we can take advantage of that, the fight may fall in our favor today.
