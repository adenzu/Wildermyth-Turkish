~01~prompt~panel_008~2_npc=Folks have been disappearing, back there. The... I don't know what's got into them.

~01~prompt~panel_013~1_coward=Anything?
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_leader=No, you?
~01~prompt~panel_013~3_speech=No. It's a little village. But I doubt they [i]all[] packed and left.
~01~prompt~panel_013~4_narration=Later...
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_narration=From a gully among the rocks rises a brief gust of voices.
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_healer=Hear that?

~01~prompt~panel_019~2_npc2=Yeah, hush!
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_legend=Come, Great One! We've brought your gift! Spare us!

~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~6_npc3=This is the price of survival. Our own are not exempt. The Great One demands sacrifice, and we have no choice but to oblige.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~2_leader=So we'll kill [i]it[].
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~6_npc3=[face:sad]You haven't seen it... the Great One, it comes with a host of <foes.cdgmt:attendant priests, cultists/bloodthirsty beastmen/misshapen beasts/crankling bone-things/shadow-spinning horrors>, monsters.

~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~8_coward=<coward.coward.60:Will we?/Guess so.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~9_healer=Mm.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~2_npc3=You really mean that? You'll stand in its way? Do battle with a deadly monster? Why?

~04~player_chose_one~panel_011~4_npc3=Well, I see no harm in letting you try. Don't expect us to throw our lives in with yours.
