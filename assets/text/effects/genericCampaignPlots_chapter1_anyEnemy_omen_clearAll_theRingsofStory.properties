~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=One of those places rings of story tend to intersect.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=Perhaps its noteworthy reputation \nattracted noteworthy people.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_narration=Or did there reside in the grounds below a latent power, \n<legend.exists:bringing myths and myth-destined together/bringing all the myth-destined to market together>?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_narration=Whatever the reason, <legend.exists:it was a place \nheroes were wont to dwell./whenever the need came,\nheroes rose from those who dwelled there.>
~01~prompt~panel_005.(hero_is_Bookish)~1_narration=There, <hero.fullname> soaked in the endless stream of curiosities and discoveries.
~01~prompt~panel_005.(hero_is_Bookish)~2_hero=He said he’d seen one, and the description checks out, but he could've read the book ahead of time...
~01~prompt~panel_006.(hero_is_Coward)~1_narration=Among them was <hero.fullname>, who never felt quite at home.
~01~prompt~panel_006.(hero_is_Coward)~2_narration=<hero.mf:He/She/They> would watch and admire the characters who filled the streets, doubting <hero.mf:his/her/their> worth beside them.
~01~prompt~panel_007.(hero_is_Goofball)~1_narration=<hero.fullname> was among them. A <hero.mf:man/woman/person> who would always find cause to peruse the square, offering up unwanted commentary. Sometimes in the form of song.
~01~prompt~panel_007.(hero_is_Goofball)~2_hero=[i]"The meat-stand smells like a bog, like a bog!\n<hero2.themePiece_wolf_head:And <hero2> barks like a dog, like a dog...!/It'll guide you through the fog, through the fog...!>"
~01~prompt~panel_008.(hero_is_Greedy)~1_narration=<hero.fullname> was one among them. <hero.mf:He/She/They> who never failed to examine whatever trinkets and rarities came through in the carts of <season> merchants.
~01~prompt~panel_008.(hero_is_Greedy)~2_hero=You don't just [i]happen[] on these things anywhere else.\nSo... look, I'll [i]pay[] you back, I'm just... waiting on... [small]some things.
~01~prompt~panel_009.(hero_is_Healer)~1_narration=<hero.fullname> was one among them. <hero.mf:He/She/They> believed that everyone had something worth sharing, and used Market Days to make friends and hear their tales.
~01~prompt~panel_009.(hero_is_Healer)~2_hero=You’d be amazed how quickly people \nopen up when you show a little interest.
~01~prompt~panel_010.(hero_is_Hothead)~1_narration=There was <hero.fullname>, intent on topping any tale that crossed <hero.mf:his/her/their> plate.
~01~prompt~panel_010.(hero_is_Hothead)~2_hero=Sheepmice are annoying, maybe, but they’re hardly the worst thing. \nSee, [i]I[] was down in the root cellar this one time...
~01~prompt~panel_011.(hero_is_Leader)~1_narration=Among them was <hero.fullname>, who seemed to know most everyone around. \n<hero.mf:He/She/They> had a knack for tying loose threads together.
~01~prompt~panel_011.(hero_is_Leader)~2_hero=Funny, I was just talking to one of the farmers last week who needed a mason. I’ll see if she’s still around.
~01~prompt~panel_012.(hero_is_Loner)~1_narration=<hero.fullname> was one among them. <hero.mf:He/She/They> supposed the \nbustling town provided <hero.mf:him/her/them> some anonymity.
~01~prompt~panel_012.(hero_is_Loner)~2_narration=It wasn't quite true, but <hero.mf:he/she/they> pretended not to know that.
~01~prompt~panel_013.(hero_is_Poet)~1_narration=Among them was <hero.fullname>, a <hero.mf:man/woman/person> who never wearied of words.
~01~prompt~panel_013.(hero_is_Poet)~2_hero=To be a baker is to be an artist. And an artist is like a baker. The craft is honed first towards [i]nourishment.[] Then [i]taste.[] And finally, [i]form.[]
~01~prompt~panel_014.(hero_is_Romantic)~1_narration=<hero.fullname> was among them, arrested by the small dramas that spiced <hero.mf:his/her/their> meals.
~01~prompt~panel_014.(hero_is_Romantic)~2_hero=All that effort, and you didn’t even [i]ask[] <npc4.awm:her/him/them> afterwards?
~01~prompt~panel_015.(hero_is_Snark)~1_narration=There was <hero.fullname>, a <hero.mf:man/woman/person> who soaked up rumors wherever <hero.mf:he/she/they> supped.
~01~prompt~panel_015.(hero_is_Snark)~2_hero=Ah well, don't be too worried. It's not as if anyone will [i]know,[] right?
~01~prompt~panel_016.(hero2_is_Bookish)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too. Contenting <hero2.mf:himself/herself/themself> on broth and book-browsing. \nCataloguing every tome that found a home on <hero2.mf:his/her/their> neighbors' shelves.
~01~prompt~panel_017.(hero2_is_Coward)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too. Distracting <hero2.mf:himself/herself/themself> with keeping a tidy home, trying <hero2.mf:his/her/their> best not to think of stories. Intersections of myth. That murky stuff.
~01~prompt~panel_017.(hero2_is_Coward)~2_narration=<hero2.mf:His/Her/Their> worries were endless. Counting all the troubles a year can bring.
~01~prompt~panel_018.(hero2_is_Goofball)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too. Testing <hero2.mf:his/her/their> worst and most \nuncomfortable material on an ever-thinning audience.
~01~prompt~panel_018.(hero2_is_Goofball)~3_hero2=[face:joke]It's funny because you [i]do[] smell it, right...?
~01~prompt~panel_019.(hero2_is_Greedy)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too. Gathering passers-through, impressing them with the extravagant meals <hero2.mf:he/she/they> could afford.
~01~prompt~panel_019.(hero2_is_Greedy)~2_narration=Reputations are a wise investment, <hero2.mf:he/she/they>'d come to believe.
~01~prompt~panel_019.(hero2_is_Greedy)~3_hero2=<hero2>’s place, make sure to say.
~01~prompt~panel_020.(hero2_is_Healer)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too, and <hero2.mf:his/her/their> roof and walls were a haven for those adrift. <hero2.mf:His/Her/Their> table was always set for visitors.
~01~prompt~panel_021.(hero2_is_Hothead)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too. Reputed for <hero2.mf:his/her/their> mercurial temper, <hero2.mf:his/her/their> tendency to appear at the heart of <town>’s rowdier scrums.
~01~prompt~panel_022.(hero2_is_Leader)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too. A well of advice, gathering those with troubles about <hero2.mf:him/her/them>. Often folks embroiled in old arguments.
~01~prompt~panel_022.(hero2_is_Leader)~2_narration=<hero2.mf:He/She/They> had a way of speaking that made conflicts seem petty, solutions obvious.
~01~prompt~panel_023.(hero2_is_Loner)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too. Most days, tucked away in a stone cottage on the outskirts. Figuring any necessary news would seep somehow through the window.
~01~prompt~panel_023.(hero2_is_Loner)~2_narration=It was quite the unusual evening that found <hero2.mf:him/her/them> at tavern, in fact.
~01~prompt~panel_024.(hero2_is_Poet)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too. Eyes fixed on things beyond the rooftops. \nWondering what omens might be spelled in the day's clouds.
~01~prompt~panel_025.(hero2_is_Romantic)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too. Dreaming of distant mountain views and ruin-wandering spirits.
~01~prompt~panel_025.(hero2_is_Romantic)~2_narration=Certain of <legend.exists:meeting again/someday meeting> monsters. Uncertain how <legend.exists:<hero2.mf:his/her/their> changed heart would/<hero2.mf:his/her/their> own heart would> react.
~01~prompt~panel_026.(hero2_is_Snark)~1_narration=<hero2.fullname> was there, too. Judging <hero2.mf:his/her/their> neighbors.
~01~prompt~panel_026.(hero2_is_Snark)~2_narration=Maybe, silently, judging <hero2.mf:his/her/their> own feelings of separateness. Estrangement.
~01~prompt~panel_026.(hero2_is_Snark)~3_narration=It was always hard to guess with <hero2>. Luckily, no one has to.
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_narration=<folk4.exists:Yes, and even <hero3.fullname><legend.exists: kept/. <hero3.mf:He was/She was/They were> just a <hero3.mf:man/woman/person> with> a small house, in those days. \nA home tucked/Also present was <hero3.fullname>. <legend.exists:Keeping <hero3.mf:his/her/their> modest home/<hero3.mf:He/She/They> owned the house>> behind the wheelwright's.
~01~prompt~panel_027~2_hero3=<hero3.personality:<hero3> journaled meticulously, somehow knowing that <hero3.mf:his/her/their> chronicle would one day be treasured by ardent readers./<hero3.mf:He/She/They> never felt quite secure in that little house[face:interested].

Making sure to be remembered, <hero3.mf:he/she/they> called it,[face:happy] and clearly hoping the memory would be happy./<hero3> wasn’t sure what mattered to <hero3.mf:him/her/them>. Finding out had always seemed like a hassle. Soon, however, <hero3.mf:he/she/they> would begin making that decision without knowing it.>

~01~prompt~panel_028~2_narration=<folk4.exists:And so it could happen that they all <folk5.exists:five/four> were there, that night. That dreadful night. \nAnd that night, in the town of <town>, their stories interlinked./...those <legend.exists:great/still-young> stories interlinked.>
