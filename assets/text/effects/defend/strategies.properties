An ululating animal moan is born in the air. It grows, and grows with the thunder of mismatched feet./Hisses and roars and trampling feet. The earth almost [i]bubbles,[] it quakes.>/<random:Glinting metal dulls as they scuttle from sun to shade. But their morbid geometry has always been easy to distinguish./Their advance is methodical and oppressive. Stone explodes into splinters when they wish it gone. Their raking limbs shine, unmarred./Shapes form where the far light falls. \nBrass gleaming and bones aglow./Finally they can be heard. Unusually quiet, but unmistakable. Like oiled machinery, like bone sliding on velvet.>/<random:No deceit, this time, no subtlety or shroud. A pit opens in the mind.../Bleeding into view, there they are./Motes of light shimmer and splash, flow like water on their prismatic shells. It's a hypnotic, almost beautiful doom./They seem to split off the very air.>>
