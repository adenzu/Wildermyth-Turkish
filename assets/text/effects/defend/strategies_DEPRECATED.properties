~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=<foes.cdgmt:<random:Lowing horns rouse tremors underfoot. Begin to drown even the wailing wind./A cheek-blanching odor rises on the air, fetid and fungal and fruited with mouthy human stinks./Tramping feet and dull, dragging calls announce them./Their horned shapes mass through the fog, numerous, shadowy, and tall./Chammering to each other, their ranks seem to grow from the ground.>/<random:Bristling figures form in view. Others, surely, advance concealed./A booming throat hangs its battlecall on the stiffening air. It's echoed in shriller octaves./They yell to each other and clang their weapons, advancing through <overlandTile.bghps:the dappled shadows, the greenery./tall grass and weeds./the valleys./the shade and shaking the pines./the wetland fog.>/Painted standards splotch the horizon. A war call resounds across the land.>/<random:First the land falls fully silent. Then their thrumming charge begins./Bleak bellows rise from all around, of beasts full of bloodlust and indigo bile./The overpowering scent of corruption descends, thick as steam. An ululating animal moan surges forward./Hisses and roars fill the distance, grow closer as the earth begins almost to bubble, to quake.>/<random:Glinting metal dulls as they scuttle from sun to shade. But their morbid geometry has always been easy to distinguish./Their advance is methodical and oppressive. Stone explodes into splinters when they wish it gone. Their raking limbs shine, unmarred./Shapes form where the far light falls. \nBrass gleaming and bones aglow./Finally they can be heard. Unusually quiet, but unmistakable. Like oiled machinery, like bone sliding on velvet.>/<random:Drone of wings and clatter of plated legs. No deceit, this time, no subtlety or shroud. A pit opens in the mind.../Trilling fleers and stickering clicks <overlandTile.bghps:trickle wetly down from the skymost boughs./scatter through the fields like lightstruck dew./wash the air of all comforting sound./trickle wetly down from the skymost boughs./spread like a rash across the swampy quiet.> Then, bleeding into view, there they are./Motes of light shimmer and splash, flow like water on their prismatic shells. It's a hypnotic, almost beautiful doom./Clickering, flickering, they spill from various holes, sometimes seeming to split off the very air.>>
