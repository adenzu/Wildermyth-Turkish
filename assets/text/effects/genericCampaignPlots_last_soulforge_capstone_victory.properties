~01~~panel_001~4_hero=<hero2.exists:Look at this thing. <hero.bookish/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:Enticingly twisted and mysterious. What properties does it truly have, how was it created?/It's almost gorgeous, isn't it?[face:talking]/[face:neutral]It was a beautiful tool, meant for the good and guarding of simple people./I don't know why.[face:neutral] It makes me imagine other times./They say nothing's made [i]quite[] how it used to be.

~01~~panel_002~4_hero=<hero2.exists:Well, yes, obviously./[face:grim]Shame you've been twisted someway. \nI don't even know [i]what[] way.>
~01~~panel_003~3_narration=<hero2.exists:/The forge must be destroyed.>
~01~~panel_003~5_hero2=<hero2.exists:<hero2.coward/goofball/loner/60:Okay, good then. Sorry./[face:happy]Oh. Good. Just making sure you're not forge-ensorcelled. Sometimes, I think, that probably happens./[face:neutral]Good, then. You never know when ancient evil's going to take over someone. Let's hit it with the anvil./Right. Just making sure we agree.[face:skeptical]>/>
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=It comes apart <hero2.exists:under tools and hands./under <hero>'s blows and tugging hands.> Eventually, it sags inward with a crumbling sigh.
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=The magic that made it, laced into its shaping, has been undone.
~01~~panel_004~6_action=Batter!
~01~~panel_004~7_action=Bash!
~01~~panel_005~1_action=[gray][actionSmall]...hew...
~01~~panel_005~2_action=[blue][actionSmall]..whee...
~01~~panel_005~3_narration=Nothing after that is wholly clear.
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=Questions will last.
~01~~panel_007~6_hero=<hero2.exists:Do you think the people whose [i]lives...[] ended there... [small]They'll be at rest, won't they?/Ghosts. Was that ghosts? What [i]are[] ghosts?>

~01~~panel_009~4_speech=[white][header]The End.
