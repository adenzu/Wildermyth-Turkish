In a forest far from home, killing or being killed. I [i]hate[] that thought. That it could go on forever.../[face:talking]<deadHero.exists:Burying friends/Scattering bones>, and skipping on to the next battle is... pretty tiresome, I'm realizing. <ship2.exists:Anyone else feel like that?/[face:sad]You feel that?> And, like... also feel like this might be the way it is? For the rest of time?/[face:talking]It's the feeling of pointlessness that gets to me.

Forever if need be./We have to be willing to do this. Again, and again, and again. That has to be the desire that draws us out of bed, and puts weapons in our palms. It may be endless./[face:neutral]My hesitation in all this... has been fighting together. Getting used to fighting together. And the weakness one of us will feel, when another dies. Because this'll never end./This feels like a battle we'll never stop fighting. Cat and mouse, hawk and crow. Fruitless, except for the great crop of death we'll reap./Never thought my life had been formed for such a gory, inglorious thing. A task. Is that what heroes... are for? It feels interminable, and love-coldening, and doomed./[face:neutral]Taste that air. <deadHero.exists:Where your friend was breathing. />Snuffled through by sick monsters who once were simple, rageless deer, stream-sucking boars and bears. Get used to that air. We'll be breathing it forever.>/>
