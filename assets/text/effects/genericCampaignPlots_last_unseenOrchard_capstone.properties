~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=Beware the whispering bough and root, \nthe wambling trunk that tickles to see.
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_narration=That unfamiliar tree bears fruit\nof misted eyes and misery.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hero=How ugly.
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_npc=Hm?
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_npc=<hero.bookish/goofball/greedy/loner/snark/60:[face:grim]/[face:grim]How to [i]dress[] one./[face:grim]Gratitude, at least./[face:grim]We were never more than humble about it./[face:grim]Consider avoiding that outcome. If possible./There were about forty of us. Little town, almost.[face:interested]>
~01~prompt~panel_004~4_hero=<hero.bookish/goofball/greedy/loner/snark/60:[face:neutral]I'm considering. That a hollow home is like a skinless skull./[face:talking]When we're done, I'll have to teach you folks how to dress a cottage./No, I'm just thinking. What can I expect if we all-the-way succeed?/[face:neutral]I'm commenting on the place. It's ugly./It's a bad day. You should probably expect <hero2.exists:us/me> to die.[face:skeptical]/How empty it is, I mean.>
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_npc=<hero.bookish/goofball/greedy/loner/snark/60:I'm glad you find it interesting./I... alright. Sure.[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]Hm./[face:grim]/[face:grim]Hm.>
~01~prompt~panel_005~4_hero=<hero.bookish/goofball/greedy/loner/snark/60:The skeleton of people's passion. Haunted by the ghost of their love for each other, the ideas they shared, or kept secret. Things they hoped to collaborate on, to write down. Artifacts. Bones. Waste./[face:neutral]Mm. Make it cute. Cutesome. Cozycrumb. And other burb./[face:grim]Yeah. That's what I'm figuring./[face:neutral]Not a big people person. But I'll even say... the place could use a few of them. Sprinkled here and there./[face:neutral]Yeah. That is my tendency./[face:neutral]That's a lot of people's lives to lose track of.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=<hero2.exists:They /Together, <hero> and <npc.mf:Father/Mother/Elder> <npc.lastname>>reach the edge of the treekeeping place, which is now quite overgrown. Fragrant haze hangs on branch and beam.
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_npc=Have you ever kept a farm? A garden? Even a dog?
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_npc=Year by year, you realize it's not just the plants themselves that you're tending to. It's the memories of those you raised them with.
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_npc=But. It's only a nest for nightmares now. \nStubborn as the worst weeds, and rampant.
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_speech=[white]The wailing trees should be destroyed, I think. \nMost of all the heart tree. You'll know it. \nIt's the biggest.
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_npc=My mind has proven weak for that work, even if my hands were still strong. Hope is that, once you succeed, some of the folks we lost... will wander home again. Freed, as I was. And I'll be here for them.
~01~prompt~panel_010~4_hero=<hero3.exists:/Makes sense. And... neither task will be pleasant.>
~01~prompt~panel_010~5_hero3=<hero3.exists:<hero3.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/snark/60:[face:neutral]Wisdom is recognition of reality. Some folks say./[face:interested]Neither task sounds especially [i]nice.[]/[face:happy]There's tea in my bag. You're welcome to it!/[face:grim]Someday, [i]I'll[] be the one who passes the job on./[face:grim]Better you than me. I'm not in the \nmood for waiting. Not today./[face:skeptical]Maybe make some tea while you're waiting. \nMake sure you're comfortable./Neither job is fit for cowards.[face:grim]>/>
