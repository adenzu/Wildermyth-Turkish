~01~~panel_001~1_speech=[i][light]"The shadows where I crouched were lit as by lightning. Again! Again! And again!
~01~~panel_001~2_speech=[light][i]"Air hurled round like I'd never felt.
~01~~panel_001~3_speech=[light][i]"I understood, of course. The fulminations flew from my own forge. <npc2>'s body was gone, <npc2.mf:his/her/their> prime and petty essences, smelted from <npc2.mf:him/her/them>, were being hammered into something new."
~01~~panel_002~1_hero=[light][i]"I once made hallowing blades. Edges to sever unwelcome spirits from the flesh they occupied. But that day, my forge became an evil place, my life's work a failure.<hero.coward/goofball/snark/60:[face:interested]/[face:talking]/[face:skeptical]/>"
~01~~panel_002~2_hero=[light][i]"I didn't go any further than I'd come. I crept up a tunnel I'd whistled down ten-thousand times, and tried to disappear."
~01~~panel_003~2_hero=[light][i]"I hope never to see the Rootqueen again. But I know, somehow, in my trembling heart, that I will."<hero.coward/goofball/snark/60:[face:interested]/[face:talking]/[face:skeptical]/>
~01~~panel_003~3_hero2=<hero.rfln.hero2:Hate to say it, but you've convinced me./[face:grim]Does it end there? I see what you mean./How horrible. I see what you mean, love.[face:grim]/It doesn't go on, does it? How... strange.> \nThat sounds like the [i]forgehall[] I dreamed of.
~01~~panel_004~3_hero3=<npc.fullname>? You needing to know where that book came from? \nI found it just last <season-3>. Traveling and poking into caves.
~01~~panel_005~1_hero=Journal belonged to someone called <npc.fullname>. It's [i]old.[] Feel this cover, it's like grasping a cooked fish. Wants to slip out of its skin.
~01~~panel_005~3_hero2=[small]Was it here in the library?
~01~~panel_006~3_hero3=It's... I mean it is pretty far.
~01~~panel_006~4_hero2=It's always far.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=Spurred by bad <season>dreaming, they embark in a couple days, to find the place <hero3> speaks of.
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=They make wise and random haste. It's not their first deathly omen.
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=Already, unseen perils are fuming from the gaps of the earth.
