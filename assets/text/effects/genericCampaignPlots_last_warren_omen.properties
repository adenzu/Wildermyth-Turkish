~01~~panel_001~2_narration=Ancient formations suddenly slithered off mountainsides.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=Fields farmers had sown spat up their seeds.
~01~~panel_003~3_narration=Weary walls slackened and slouched, where long they'd stood upright.
~01~~panel_004~4_narration=From time to time, it could be felt.
~01~~panel_005~3_narration=Everything softly, very softly, [b]shaking.
~01~~panel_005~4_narration=Lying down to sleep, listening to the beams and foundations.
~01~~panel_006~2_npc3=<company.thisCampaign_cavernquarryGeneric:Unlike the tremors we had, years ago, this/The> disturbance is dissonant with the will of the wildkeepers.
~01~~panel_006~3_narration=Beyond saying so, sages can but sagely shrug.

Hope you didn't drink [i]everything.[]/<hero.goofball/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:dubious]Yeah? Great.

~01~~panel_009~3_hero=<hero.pcfn.hero2:The haste of youth! <hero.greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:skeptical]If only I could borrow some of it, huh?/[face:joy]I could borrow some of that! Or I mean, I wish I could. You know what I mean!/[face:neutral]Good then, I suppose, that we sent you./[face:dubious]You seem to enjoy flaunting it./[face:happy]I'm at the age I'm beginning to remark on it.>/Why wouldn't I be here, <hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Ren-ren>? <hero.bookish/coward/goofball/60:Actually I was expecting I'd have longer.

~01~~panel_010~1_narration=<hero> and <hero2> spend the night going over the accounts of trailgoers with <hero5.exists:the others/<hero4.exists:<hero4> and <hero3>/<hero3>>>. Parsing possibilities.
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=One story stands out, for it was repeated most often.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=A <npc.mf:wolfman/wolflady/wolfwalker> lived by a hill. And one <season-1> morning, the hill yawned open.
~01~~panel_012~3_hero2=That's the <npc.mf:guy/woman/person> we need to talk to.
~01~~panel_013~2_narration=They leave on the heels of dawn.
~01~~panel_013~4_hero2=<hero3.themePiece_wolf_head:Assuming <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> still there to find.[face:grim]/Or at least the [i]place.[] Right?>

~01~~panel_013~6_hero=<hero3.themePiece_wolf_head:/You want us to find a wolf<npc.mf:man/lady/walker> who lives across the world...?>
~01~~panel_014~3_narration=Trails give way to trails, days to more days.
~01~~panel_015~1_hero=<hero.personality:It's depraved, isn't it? The way we go about assessing where best to find our deaths... and then we proceed to stick our noses there, almost immediately?[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]Are we sure [i]canyons[] are smart? Are we sure the [i]journey[] won't kill us? And I mean, are we sure this is <foes.cdgmt:Deepist/Drauven/Gorgon/Morthagi/Thrixl>-done?/Maybe the mountains ate something nasty. <foes.plural> aren't the only bad-tasting thing in the world.[face:happy] Maybe we should just wait for the great stomach in the ground to settle?/[face:grim]I'm sensing, now, that we'll wind up under the hills. One way or another. Am I right? Anyone want to bet on it?/Might be a battle where we're going. But a buckling bridge, a pass folding in around us... [face:talking]those're the dangers right now./[face:talking]Figures. We have to find some way to fix \nthe <company.thisCampaign_cavernquarryGeneric:dirt, again/dirt, now>. We fix [i]everything.[]/Primary concern is getting where we're headed, <hero4.exists:all/the three> of us intact. Let's keep that in mind./[face:grim]Going elsewhere for problems still seems unnecessary./Out of the warmth and into the cold. Out of the sun and under the hills.  How unwise we are./[face:happy]What lurid monsters wait? The road is for imagining. What new legend will be hung on our names or sung on our graves?/Anyone considered it's just bad dirt? The dirt's bad. So... wouldn't that make sense, and stop us from having to take this journey?>
~01~~panel_016~2_narration=Perhaps <npc.fullname>, the Wolfwalker, still lives.
~01~~panel_016~3_narration=<npc.mf:His/Her/Their> unique knowledge of this disaster is what they hope to salvage.
~01~~panel_017~4_hero3=[small]Wolf moon.
~01~~panel_017~5_hero2=<hero2.personality:Full moon. I almost didn't record it.../Skull moon.[face:interested]/Skeleton-pate moon![face:happy]/Gambler's moon.
