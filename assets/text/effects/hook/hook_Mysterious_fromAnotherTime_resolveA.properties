~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The final blow leaves the warrior, Nan, dazed and weaponless.
~01~~panel_001~2_npc=Oof!
~01~~panel_002~2_hook=<hook.healer.60:[face:interested]You alright? Sorry about that.../I'm afraid we're tougher than we look.>
~01~~panel_003~2_action=[white]Heh, heh!
~01~~panel_003~3_narration=<npc.mf:He falls/She falls/They fall> to a knee.
~01~~panel_004~2_npc=You've beaten me fairly and proven your worth as warriors. Take your one look into Pool of Revisions.
~01~~panel_005~2_npc=However, you should know that while you can see what would've been, you can never change what was...
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=<hook> steps forward as Nan steps back.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=<hook.mf:He leans/She leans/They lean> by the glimmering blue waters. The smell of damp minerals and cavemoss fills <hook.mf:his/her/their> nose...
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=Gazing in the pool, <hook.mf:he sees/she sees/they see> nothing but the bottom.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=Until...
~01~~panel_009.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~1_narration=<hook.mf:He sees/She sees/They see> <hook.mf:himself/herself/themself> almost as <hook.mf:he is/she is/they are> now, out of time and place in a place <hook.mf:he hasn't/she hasn't/they haven't> quite forgotten. <hook.mf:He/She/They> can't remember what happened here. But there's a lurch inside, a sense of... shame?
~01~~panel_010.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~1_narration=A cry for help echoes through the woods...
~01~~panel_010.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~2_narration=...and also the howl of a horrible beast.
~01~~panel_010.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~3_action=[actionLarge][dark]ha-WOO-oo!!
~01~~panel_010.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~4_action=[actionSmall]Someone!?\n Anyone!?
~01~~panel_011.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~1_narration=A child, then... <hook> now remembers running. Leaving whoever it was to the mercy of an unseen monster...
~01~~panel_012.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~1_narration=But in this version, <hook.mf:he marshalls/she marshalls/they marshall> <hook.mf:his/her/their> courage, and goes to where <hook.mf:he hears/she hears/they hear> the cries.
~01~~panel_013.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~1_narration=<hook.mf:He arrives/She arrives/They arrive> in time only to see the severing of a young man's body.
~01~~panel_013.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~2_narration=A sword-sharp beak makes quick work of the corpse. And then...
~01~~panel_014.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~1_narration=...it raises its blood-dripping head.
~01~~panel_014.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~2_narration=Its horrible eyes latch onto <hook>.
~01~~panel_015.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~1_narration=<hook.mf:He's/She's/They're> terrified, frozen. It advances.
~01~~panel_015.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~2_narration=And...!
~01~~panel_016.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~1_narration=<hook.mf:He falls/She falls/They fall> out of the memory. Waterlight dances on the dark cave roof.
~01~~panel_016.(hook_is_coward_>_60)~3_hook=No! Stay back...!
~01~~panel_017.(hook_NOT_coward)~1_narration=<hook.mf:He sees/She sees/They see> <hook.mf:himself/herself/themself> almost as <hook.mf:he is/she is/they are> now, out of time and place in a place <hook.mf:he hasn't/she hasn't/they haven't> quite forgotten. <hook.mf:He/She/They> can't remember what happened here, but there's a knife inside <hook.mf:him/her/them>, a sense of real hurt.
~01~~panel_018.(hook_NOT_coward)~3_narration=<hook.mf:He's/She's/They're> speaking to someone.
~01~~panel_019.(hook_NOT_coward)~1_narration=And the word comes to <hook.mf:him/her/them> in a flash.
~01~~panel_020.(hook_NOT_coward)~2_hook=<npc3.mf:Brother.../Sister.../Sibling...>?
~01~~panel_021.(hook_NOT_coward)~3_narration=<hook.mf:His sister/Her brother/Their sibling> is preparing to go on a journey.
~01~~panel_022.(hook_NOT_coward)~3_narration=They argue, and <npc3.mf:he turns/she turns/they turn> away.
~01~~panel_023.(hook_NOT_coward)~2_hook=I let <npc3.mf:him/her/them> leave...
~01~~panel_024.(hook_NOT_coward)~3_narration=Suddenly <hook.mf:he feels/she feels/they feel> the ache of watching <npc3.mf:him/her/them> go. Realizes <npc3.mf:he/she/they> never came home again, though <hook.mf:he/she/they> waited years...
~01~~panel_025.(hook_NOT_coward)~3_narration=But in this vision, <hook> follows, and convinces <npc3.mf:him/her/them> to stay.
~01~~panel_026.(hook_NOT_coward)~3_narration=Their lives after that go on, in whatever small village this was. Neither of them leave home, and they live wondering what they might've been if they'd made bolder choices.
~01~~panel_027.(hook_NOT_coward)~1_narration=<hook.mf:He stands/She stands/They stand>. The memory in the pool fades. Waterlight dances on the dark cave roof.
~01~~panel_028~4_hook2=<hook.coward.60:You alright?/You never told me about your <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling>.>
~01~~panel_029~3_hook=<hook.coward.60:[face:sad]I'm... What I saw, I'm... I'm alive.../I... suppose I... was trying to forget. I don't even recall where we lived, or how we... or what we...>
~01~~panel_030~3_hook=<hook.coward.60:[face:sad]I'm alive because I'm a coward./[face:sad]I think that <npc3.mf:he/she/they> must've died somewhere. Far from home. And I must've left, after that, and buried my memories.>
~01~~panel_030~4_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:sad]/>
~01~~panel_031~2_npc=<hook.coward.60:[face:happy]To be alive is a wonderful thing. Life's full of chances to be brave./Then today, in a sense, you got your <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling> back.>
~01~~panel_031~3_hook=<hook.coward.60:/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_033~1_narration=Before they go...
~01~~panel_034~1_narration=<hook2> takes <hook2.mf:his/her/their> own glance into what might've been.
~01~~panel_035.(volunteer_exists)~1_narration=<volunteer>, too, decides to have a look.
~01~~panel_036~1_narration=And then they file out. Quiet eyes and thundering thoughts.
