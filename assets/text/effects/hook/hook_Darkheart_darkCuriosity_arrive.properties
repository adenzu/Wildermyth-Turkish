~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=Often they traveled in the night. The moon was new, stars far away, and the darkness deep.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/leader/poet/60:What you're about to see is the product of meticulous preparation./I don't want you to be afraid. I was, my first time, and it didn't end well for me./I'll let you in on a little secret. Everyone will decry your efforts, and call you a power-mad lunatic./The truth is it takes someone willing to enter the darkness in order for bright gold to be found, or diamonds, or.../What you don't realize when you're a kid is there's no such thing as [i]evil[].>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/leader/poet/60:Years spent studying the occult from appalling journals, necromantic tomes, and a few mad diaries./So just... stay wary, but don't be shocked when stuff levitates, or a flame bursts out of a rock or something./But it's because you're willing to do the things they're afraid to do. It makes them jealous, just as it makes you strong./...what's your favorite cave-thing?/There's just the things people don't like you to do, for one reason or another.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook2=<hook.bookish/coward/leader/poet/60:Just those bad-sounding books?/What are you saying? Your first time?/That sounds.../<hook2.goofball.60:[face:joke]Oh, <hook2.awm:cave-women/cave-men>? Scantily clad.../I don't know. Bears. Bears have sort of appealed to me since I was small.>/Is that right?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/leader/poet/60:Also some dog-literature./My first summoning. Barely survived it./Anyway, but... So how are you doing? Worn out?/<hook2.goofball.60:[face:dubious]...okay, well. Right, someone must go into the dark and coax them out./Okay, sure, the bears. Someone must reach within the dark and pull out bears.>/Now, granted, it's often very good reasons. Logical ones.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook2=<hook.bookish/coward/leader/poet/60:[face:happy]Oh, yeah. Dogs are cute, aren't they?/[face:surprised]A [i]summoning[]? [i]You're[] going to do a... you call it a summoning?/I'm good. How about you? You good?/Is that you who does that?/<hook.rfln.hook2:Stuff like, 'We don't want our homes destroyed, so don't burn them'?/[face:interested]I don't know. You really believe that?/[face:interested]<hook2.poet.60:I've thought... there's no evil, just things like violence, greed, oppression. No good, but true things like love, and compassion, and kindness./[face:interested]Alright, but you do respect those reasons, don't you?>/--->>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=...Yes.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hook2=<hook.bookish/coward/leader/poet/60:<hook2.bookish/hothead/loner/60:Before we domesticated them, do you think people saw dogs as monsters?/Dogs turn mean if they're not fed. I understand that. Something in me is like that.../Dogs are much better than people, I often think./I'd like a dog someday. [face:happy]<hook2.personality:A smart dog who'd sniff out rodents, and sit by me while I'm reading./A strong dog with a courageous heart. Keep me and anyone else safe./Some silly hound, I'd teach <hook2.mf:him/her/them> to swipe people's socks./A hunting dog, it'd bring me meat without me lifting a finger!/A cozy retriever to spend walks with, who'd love everyone we met./A rough-and-tumble mastiff, maybe, always ready for a run or tussle./Could even be a little dog, as long as it's got a good nose and a loyal heart./A dog who only lets me near. Big and beautiful and almost wild./A dog without a known breed, maybe. A wanderer./Something wolflike, noble, but sweet too. Get the <hook2.awm:girls'/boys'> attention./One of those ugly-cute dogs that pees on other people's stuff.>>/I don't know why, but I never really thought you... had that kind of ambition or something. I don't know./I suppose it's true that... someone has to make the tough choices, sacrifice a little purity./It's like running out into the rain to bring your sheets in. You'll be soaked, but you may at least sleep dry./<hook.rfln.hook2:Sounds like you think you might be evil./[face:interested]Good and evil are easy ideas though. Like with apples. Simple to sort apples into [i]Eat[] and [i]Don't Eat[]./[face:intrested]<hook2.poet.60:I think that's good. It's like... taking responsibility./You struggle with tangled ideas. I know...>/--->>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_narration=<hook> finds a path in the dark, up the side of an old weatherblasted hill...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_narration=...where an ancient altar waits.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=<Hook> removes a small effigy from <hook.mf:his/her/their> pack.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook2=And okay, what's that hideous doll about?
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook=The effigy looks like an amalgamation of all the foes they've ever brought down.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_hook=<hook.mf:He slides/She slides/They slide> it into the altar's higher compartment.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hook2=<hook>? What [i]is[] that?
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hook=Made it from monsterparts! All kinds!
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_hook2=<hook2.missionVictory_strangeBehavior_watching:This is what you were... collecting./Monsterparts...>
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hook=Sure. Some fine specimens, too. The trick is to take pieces reminiscent of the original body, but obscure enough not to be reminded of who they were.
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_hook2=So now we...
~01~prompt~panel_017~3_hook=Now the spell just needs blood.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_action=[cherry]slek
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~2_narration=<hook> cuts <hook.mf:his/her/their> hand.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=Hold your thumb out.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~2_hook2=My thumb?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/poet:[face:interested]There are no truly [i]demonic[] presences such spells may call on. Because 'demon' was always an ill-born term for the Lostlings.../The worst part about blood conjuring is you've usually got to self mutilate to get the ball rolling. It's in the name, I suppose./[face:rage]Now under the obsidian eye of night, let my blood flower and fruit, a Lostling's bottomless heart be fed!>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~2_narration=<hook.mf:He squeezes/She squeezes/They squeeze> blood onto the small abomination.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~1_hook=Nothing's happening. How strange.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~1_narration=And then something does!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~2_action=[blue][actionLarge]Bzzak!!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~1_hook=With your blood to spark the summoning, the spell will be yours as well as mine.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~1_hook2=Huh... do I want that?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~1_hook=Trust me, it's better to be [i]casting[] the spell, rather than simply... [i]next to[] it.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:No, no, I don't own anyone. I'm not [i]that[] kind of darkist./[face:skeptical]Uhhhh.../Don't worry. Your part's easy./--->
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~2_hook2=Fine. <hook.rfln.hook2:But you owe me, yeah?/But it better not hurt./I guess we've done weirder stuff./--->
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Huh? I said o--/Does it h--?/Tell me when y--/--->
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~4_narration=<hook> takes <hook2>'s offered hand...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~1_action=Mmp!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~2_action=[cherry][actionSmall]slit!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~3_narration=...and cuts a line down the thumb.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~1_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/poet:[face:interested]The most fascinating part of blood-conjuring is the hierarchical ranking of plasmas, from the truly wise beings down to the beetles and fish. High blood for high magic./I take blood for granted a lot of the time. I shouldn't. Look how eagerly it leaves the body.../[face:rage]I call upon you, Lostling: mourning-heart and immortal mazewalker! Fill this vessel and find what you've never found!>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~2_narration=<hook.mf:He squeezes/She squeezes/They squeeze> blood onto the small abomination.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_010~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook.bookish/goofball/poet:That's. So. Interesting./You... Erk. Are horrible./Or don't, I don't care...>/<hook.bookish/goofball/poet:I always did think I had great blood. Erk./That's... really... erk./Yeah, and be quick about it. Erk.>/<hook.bookish/goofball/poet:Yeah... I'm glad you like my blood. Erk./Why do I love you? Erk./Is that what you were, erk, practicing in the mirror?>/--->
~05~player_chose_no~panel_011~2_narration=They wait, watching for a change.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_012~2_narration=<hook2> wraps <hook2.mf:his/her/their> wounded thumb.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_013~1_hook=Do you have mustardblood or something?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_013~3_hook2=If you...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_014~1_narration=And then a great beast flares into being!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_014~2_action=[blue][actionLarge]Bzzak!!
