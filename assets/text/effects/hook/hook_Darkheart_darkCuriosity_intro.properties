~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook=<hook.coward/goofball/healer/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic:[face:joy]Better to slip away now, when no one's watching!/[face:joke]<hook.mf:He moves/She moves/They move> through the dark, an oiled black snake. <hook> the Shadow Serpent is the only one awake!/[face:joy]It's better I go in the night. Better than trying to explain, revealing more of the truth than would serve them.../[face:joy]Happy endings and sunshine for all of them, I hope. As for me... [i]someone[] has to get <hook.mf:his/her/their> hands dirty!/[face:joy]Good to be alone again. No questions, no awkward lies.../[face:joke]Power isn't something you snatch in broad daylight. Shadows are for sharp wits, for bold desires, and all the attendant rewards.../[face:joy]That my quest begins on the darkest night of the season! Let it not be said I lack for dramatic flare!/[face:joke]The stars shiver, beads of salty sweat on the moonkissed skin of the night. Truly, it is an auspicious beginning.>

~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:So you think you're just going to slip away in the night, and no one's going to notice? No one's going to be just a little suspicious?/On your way out of here? Can I ask where you're going, or better yet.../Right, well... I thought we were going for a midnight drink?/--->
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:In the middle of the night? Yes./Better yet, can you not ask?/Ah. Ah, we had plans, didn't we? Well, sure I'm... I mean, I'd like to, but.../--->
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Well. I find myself unable to sleep./Truth is I've been having these dreams./...but you'd rather slink surreptitiously out of town, whispering dark things and emitting eldritch giggles? Where you going?/--->
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook=You want to come with me.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Or do you have something to hide?/[face:dubious]I just don't think you should go alone./Unless you really don't want me to.../--->
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook=No, fine. Come along. Bring a friend if you wish. I'm only warning you... this might get dark.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=Actually... It's a terrible night to leave. Because of the... the... thing.
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
