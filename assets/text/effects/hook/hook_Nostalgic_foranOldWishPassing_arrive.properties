~01~prompt~panel_003~4_npc=Place I'm looking for shouldn't be far.
~01~prompt~panel_003~5_hook=Can I ask about <npc2>? I don't think either of us ever met <npc2.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook2=I remember you talking about <npc2.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_npc=I'm sorry. <npc2.mf:He/She/They> never came with me to <town>. Always wanted <npc2.mf:him/her/them> to, but <npc2.mf:he was/she was/they were> never quite well enough, and \n<npc2.mf:he/she/they> insisted on staying home to tend the farm.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc=We met <hook.healer/leader/snark:in the spring. I remember clearly. My grandma had just passed./when we were seven. I would visit <npc2.mf:him/her/them> with bread and pies. When we got older.../when we were both young, and we liked to laugh, prank, and start trouble.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_npc3=<hook.healer/leader/snark:There's nothing more precious than a <npc2.mf:man/woman/person> who can make you laugh, even when you're hurting.../I can't say when it changed, only that it did. A gift or a smile between neighbors starts to mean more./It's going to sound sappy if I start telling you: how we knew we belonged together, how it felt like fate. So I won't.> We built the farm, there. On the rocky hill.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=<npc2.mf:He/She/They> liked the farm, <npc2>.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc3=<npc2.mf:He was/She was/They were> a <hook.bookish/healer/leader/poet/romantic:thoughtful and willful/kind and humble/good and honest/sweet and simple/bright and imaginative> <npc2.mf:man/woman/person>. Shy, though. <npc2.mf:He was/She was/They were> born with an illness that never fully left. Our good times were great...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_npc3=...but our bad times... when <npc2.mf:he/she/they> couldn't rise from bed. Those made my heart splinter. And one day... it shattered.
~01~prompt~panel_011~6_npc=If there's one thing I know, it's that I don't want to live in that empty house without <npc2.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=The forest had been dead quiet, when they entered. As they've gone deeper, noises have filtered into hearing. Drips, scrapes, low trills.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_narration=The smells have turned richer: of damp earth, spicy bark, quilted mosses in purplegreen and beige.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_narration=Soon, the ox halts.
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_narration=They come into a clearing \nwhere a goddess lives.
~01~prompt~panel_014~3_hook=Oh.
~01~prompt~panel_015~4_hook2=<npc>?
~01~prompt~panel_016~3_npc=Yes, I intended to find her... the reason I brought <npc2> here. The reason [i]I'm[] here and [i]you're[] here...
~01~prompt~panel_017~3_npc=Oruwe, she's a goddess of borders and inbetweens.\nThis realm of hers welcomes both dead and living.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_hook2=<npc><hook2.bookish/healer/hothead/leader/poet/romantic/60:, you have to slow down. Clearly this idea's been germinating for some time./... I understand you're in pain, and you want to make the pain stop. But this...?/, you're babbling nonsense. \nWhat are you [i]saying[]?/, you're not thinking straight. I know \nhow deeply you loved <npc2.mf:him/her/them>, but.../, your voice, to me... it's like the cry of great wounded elk, resolved now on dying./... you're like someone out of a story, but I don't know which one. A tragic one./[face:skeptical], go slower. You're going to \n[i]join[] <npc2.mf:him/her/them>? How?>
~01~prompt~panel_019~3_npc=So I'm here to join <npc2.mf:him/her/them>. <npc2> and I \ncan be together still.
~01~prompt~panel_020~5_npc=Look, it's this forest. I read about it. This goddess, Oruwe, rules it. Like a region between our world and a place for the departed. I suppose, it exists for us... For those like us. A place <npc2> can be without pain. And I can be with <npc2>.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_hook=<hook.bookish/healer/hothead/romantic/60:Oruwe is one of the oldest gods or spirits there is. She won't ever release you./[face:sad]What you're talking about means giving up everything else./[face:grim]That's not right, is it? You're talking about dying./You'd really give up everything, wouldn't you? For the unknown... for <npc2>.../But isn't it just like... dying, yourself? \nCrossing over, to be together?>
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_npc=I won't be able to leave this place, but why would I wish to? I'll still [i]live[]. <npc2.mf:He/She/They> will too. We'll just live here.
~01~prompt~panel_023~6_npc=You have to understand. This is what I want. All I need is for you to help me complete the ceremony, and take the poor Ox back with you. <hook.rfln.hook2:<lover.exists:Don't you have a lover, <hook>?<ship.exists: And you, <hook2>?/> Put yourself in my position.../<ship.exists:Don't you have a lover, <hook2>?/Try to imagine if you had someone that meant everything to you.

~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook=I'm sorry, <npc>. We can't stand here and let you throw your life behind <npc2.mf:his/hers/theirs>.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=You know, it... [i]should be[] <npc.mf:his/her/their> choice.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~2_hook2=<ship.exists:I can't say I'd do different<hook.rfln.hook2:, if <ship> was/, if <ship> was/, if it was you/--> in that cart.../Can't say I disagree.>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~6_npc=[face:angry]What do you mean you can't [i]let me[]?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~7_hook=We're not in the business of letting friends die, by any name, by their choice or not. I know you feel this is the only way...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~2_hook=<hook.goofball/leader/romantic/60:[face:happy]...but sometimes [i]I[] eat old meat because I see no other way to get full. It's [i]never[] the right decision. Don't feed a starving heart on rotted wishes.../...but it's only the easy path. You can take the memories, hard and happy, along with you. And honor <npc2.mf:him/her/them>. Build something in <npc2.mf:his/her/their> name, that <npc2.mf:he/she/they>'d love./...but if I were <npc2>, I'd hate this. I'd want my love to live <lover.exists:<lover.mf:his/her/their>/<hook.awm:her/his>> life. Happily. Come to me only having gotten all <lover.exists:<lover.mf:he/she/they>/<hook.awm:she/he>> could out of living./[face:skeptical]...but why? What proof do you have that it'll work? Do you think this goddess will demand nothing else from you?>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~1_npc=<hook.goofball/leader/romantic/60:[face:sad]But I don't know how to just.../Something <npc2.mf:he/she/they>'d love...?/That's... well. But I'm.../Proof? Well in the books...>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~8_hook2=You're not doing this today.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~9_hook=[face:skeptical]That's a starting-point, isn't it?\nAll that matters is today.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~10_npc=<npc2>...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~3_narration=Silent minutes slip by. They pass without motion save for the roll of mist, the blink of damp eyelids, the fall of silverstruck tears. Finally, <npc> raises <npc.mf:his/her/their> head and addresses the shrine at <npc.mf:his/her/their> back.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_007~4_npc=Dear goddess. I'm sorry. Today, I'll leave your wood to your own... I'll... I may be back.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_008~1_narration=They turn the ox around.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_008~2_narration=But...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_008~9_action=[orange]Rrmuu...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~10_hook=<npc>?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~1_narration=Surprising and slow, a low long-stretching sound coils up from the stones, the roots, and the earth.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~6_npc=I don't know...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~10_action=scrash!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~11_action=[actionSmall]scrick.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~1_narration=As it speaks, something huge crashes through the trees!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~8_action=[orange]please...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~9_action=[orange][action]STAYYY...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~7_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/romantic/60:It's a courageous choice, and hopefully not unwise. We'll only learn by doing, of course. So what's the process?/[face:skeptical]I'll tell you, I'm not certain I'd ever put my faith in a stone tree god, or ask for a life<lover.exists:, with <lover> or without,/> in a haunted forest. But it's your plan. What do we do?/[face:happy]Not that I'd claim to understand. <lover.exists:I love <lover>, and all... but I don't think either of us would wish for an existence here, haunting the gloom. But alright, what's the first thing?/There's no one I love enough, I suppose, that I'd go haunting the gloom with them forever. But alright, what's the first thing?>/I'll admit, I find it fairly interesting. I'm curious what you'll see on the other side, and whether we have anything to gain from exploring it. Tell us what to do./[face:happy]Honestly, it's like something from a legend: a <npc.mf:fellow/woman/person> passing into the realm of a god to be with the <npc2.mf:man/lady/one> <npc.mf:he cherishes/she cherishes/they cherish>. How do we help?/Well, <npc>... if this is what you say it is...\nthen how do we help? How do we make sure \nyou get what you want from it?>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~2_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/snark/60:[face:skeptical]Her own people, long ago, were turned to stone. This realm was for them. It stands to reason she'd want to protect them.../[face:interested]Oh, a test? Well that's... concerning.\nI don't suppose we know more?/[face:joke]A test, huh? Well, fortunately, I'm one of the greatest cheaters there is./[face:dubious]Oh, alright. She'll test us./[face:grim]We tend to test well, I'd say.>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~1_npc=We'll lay us both at the foot of the shrine... and then. She'll test us. Oruwe will.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~4_npc=It [i]is[] dangerous. We must duel Oruwe's guardian. It's why I needed you along, but if you decline, I'll understand, and I'll fight it alone.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~8_hook2=You're not a fighter, <npc>. Hold on to <npc2>. \n<hook2.coward/goofball/greedy/romantic/snark/60:[face:skeptical]We'll stand for you... and hope we win./[face:happy]We're purebred heroes, me and<hook.rfln.hook2:... well, me, anyway.\nI'll/ <hook>, and \nwe'll/ my <hook>, \nand we'll/--> see you through to the other side./[face:happy]We [i]are[] getting an ox out of it, after all./[face:happy]We'll gladly be your champions./[face:skeptical]We actually do this sort of thing a lot./We'll beat whatever she puts in front of us.>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~1_narration=They pull <npc2>'s shrouded body \nfrom the cartbed.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~2_narration=True to its reputation, the woven vines of dawnsward have kept <npc2.mf:him/her/them> perfectly preserved.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~1_narration=With <npc2> across <npc>'s lap...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~2_narration=...the two rest at the foot of Oruwe's shrine.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~7_npc=Goddess... Goddess Oruwe, hear me. Beneath your mercy lie two who wish to roam your realm together. Live in your lands, and laugh again. Please, permit us to stay.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~7_npc=Send your guardian, and my champions shall stand to fight it. Send your guide, and my love and I shall go behind.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_010~1_narration=Garlands of mist wrap and twist round boughs, statues, arms and legs, and over their damp-dusted cheeks.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_010~2_narration=The quiet air clumps in their throats.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_011~1_narration=But then...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_011~6_action=[orange]Rrmuu...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_012~1_narration=The voice of Oruwe is a groan, faraway and felt more than heard.\nIt's in the stones and roots, and rises from somewhere deepdown.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_013~1_narration=A noise nears them, crashing through the trees.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_013~7_action=[orange]Truth is tested.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_013~9_action=thrsshh!
