Alright, lead on./[face:skeptical]Well... I guess I'm already here.>/<hook2.bookish/goofball/healer/hothead/poet/romantic/60:Curious. Perhaps  your mind veils your memories in order to protect you?/[face:talking]Possibly the pancreas. I've read where that's kind of a chancy organ./[face:sad]I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~1_narration=They come upon the pool, not far inside. But there's someone standing before it.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~2_npc=<hook>. I'm Nan. Good to meet you.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~3_hook=You know my name.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~1_hook2=<hook2.poet/snark/60:[face:interested]How beautiful.../[face:dubious]Watched [i]<hook.mf:him/her/them>[]? Sounds dull./That's a bit of a claim.>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~1_npc=Since you were a child, I've watched your progress. I knew we were destined to meet, one day.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_007~2_hook=I've heard this called the Pool of Visions...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_008~1_npc=You've heard wrong. In fact, it's the Pool of [i]Re[]visions.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~2_npc=Here, you can see what would've happened if you were to change one decision in your life.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~4_hook2=What? It's like a...

~04~player_chose_yes~panel_011~1_hook2=<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/leader/romantic/60:[face:interested]That's amazing.

~04~player_chose_yes~panel_012~1_npc=<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/leader/romantic/60:[face:grim]And yet, often the learning can leave us feeling more foolish./[face:grim]There's always that chance./[face:grim]Right, I'd call it more of a mistake-o-scope./[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]It's not necessarily what you hope to see./[face:interested]Hm? What are you saying?/The conditional past. It's a different tense entirely.>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_012~nameTag_2=Nan
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_013~2_npc=In any case, you may only look once. And only after you've defeated the challenge.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_013~3_hook=<hook.snark.60:The challenge is you, isn't it?/And the challenge is what?>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_014~2_npc=<hook.snark.60:I. Am. The Challenge./[face:grim]In my youth, I was greedy, strong. I sought to slay the Godbeast, Mo-Atona, to show my might. Rather than end me, she saved my soul. Gave my life its purpose.>

~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~1_npc2=<hook>... It's been so long. You're all grown.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~3_hook2=<hook2.healer.60:Uh, excuse us, <npc2.mf:sir/miss/uh>.../Um, <npc2.mf:old man/old woman/hello>? What're you doing here?>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~4_hook=Why're you talking like we've met each other? I mean... have we?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~1_npc2=<hook.mf:Sweet boy/Sweet girl/Sweet child>. I owe you my freedom. I'm sad that you don't remember.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]/[face:interested]<hook>?/[face:happy]See? You saved someone./>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~4_npc2=I didn't look the way I do now.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~5_hook=Oh.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~6_narration=Like a surge of water up from broken earth, \nthe memory wells in <hook.mf:him/her/them>...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~1_narration=It's a home <hook.mf:he/she/they> never could recall.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~2_narration=Two people.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~3_narration=<hook.mf:His/Her/Their> parents?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_010~1_narration=Smell of <hook.bookish/hothead/leader/loner:book-glue and the thick scraping pages of books./forge smoke from a smith down the road./bright new dew on fresh thatch./a quiet, dark, cool house in summer.> Taste of <hook.goofball/greedy/romantic/snark:sweetbread, plum pie./a million cheeses and cakes./strawberries and silky cream./hot mustard and sour pickles.> <hook.coward/healer/poet:Peeling boiled shrimp/Watching the pot of seaweed soup/Checking tidepools for bounty>, roasting the catch.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_010~4_hook=They were so... beautiful.\nSo happy... Then.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_011~3_hook=Can these memories really be... mine?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_012~1_narration=A child finds a tree in the woods. \nCarved writing on it that <hook.mf:the boy/the girl/they> can't read.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_012~2_narration=And an axe left buried in the bark.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_013~1_narration=The axe-handle is too big to grip in one hand.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_013~2_narration=<hook.mf:He uses/She uses/They use> two.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_014~1_narration=As the blade jiggles loose...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_014~2_narration=...black smoke seeps from \n     the wounded trunk.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_015~4_hook=I took it out of the... out of the tree. I took the axe out. And then...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_017~4_hook=You... You killed them... \nAnd I just watched...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_018~1_npc2=You [i]freed[] me, <hook>! My gratitude is [i]deep[]!\nSo I beckoned you here, and I'll fulfill my debt!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_019~1_npc2=Here we are, at the Pool of Reckoning, where the powerful come to claim their stories as their own.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_020~1_npc2=The corpse we cast together into the water... that will seal our bond. We'll be masters of all we see!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_021~2_hook=<hook2>?
