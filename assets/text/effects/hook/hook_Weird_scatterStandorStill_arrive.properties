hook_Weird_scatterStandorStill_arrive.0.playerChose_yes.1.1.name=Infection
~01~prompt~panel_001~4_narration=The journey often seems directionless to <hook2>.
~01~prompt~panel_001~5_narration=Longcuts chosen over short, expeditions through the brambles and along barren tracts.
~01~prompt~panel_001~6_narration=They take hungry trails, starved for forage as much as for purpose.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hook=I think we're here.
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:You don't even know \nwhere we are, do you?/Yeah? Alright, well, where's [i]here[]?/We are? What's this place \ngot to do with us?/==>
~01~prompt~panel_002~4_narration=But <hook> seems to wake each morning with confidence where <hook.mf:his/her/their> eyes should go, what horizon <hook.mf:his/her/their> feet should aim towards. And finally...
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_hook=It's inside of me.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_hook=These're my insides, <hook2>.\nMy actual bones and organs.
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_hook2=I guess what you mean is it's--
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_hook=Here, follow me.
~01~prompt~panel_006~5_hook2=<hook2.bookish/goofball/hothead/poet/snark/60:[face:skeptical]Hm. This'll be an interesting conceit. Can you explain?/[face:happy]Alright, that's kind of fun./<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]So what you're saying is I've entirely wasted my time./[face:neutral]Alright, well, no. That's obviously untrue. Where are we [i]really?[]/[face:dubious]You're having fun with me, right?/--->/No...? The branches, the sky, the ground?[face:interested] This's a metaphor./[face:dubious]I see. Well I'm sorry to report that your liver's got too many lichens./<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]///><hook>, I... alright. Alright, well... how did we get inside you all the sudden?>
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_hook=I get that it's a pretty... [i]unfirming[] idea. <hook.bookish/poet/60:And I wish it was more like a library. I mean, I'd envision it that way./The trees are to be expected, in a <hook.mf:man/woman/person>. A <hook.whm:bear-heart/roamer/<hook.mf:sorcerer/sorceress/sorcerer>> like I am... certainly you'd say <hook.mf:he/she/they> must have rocks in there. And sky./For a while I thought it was too absurd to believe. But then I was like, wait, of [i]course![]>
~01~prompt~panel_007~4_hook2=[small] <hook.bookish/poet/60:A library./[i]I'd[] say that?/Of course?>
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hook=<hook.bookish/poet/60:You'd see my heart like a great dictionary of feelings, beating its leather covers together in the shade of my sternum. And otherwise shelves and shelves into all the distances of thought. And we'd row around the shelves on canals, my veins. My blood./But, and I've sort of been approaching the idea a long time. We think our souls are inside us, but what if that's just not the geography? What if it's weirder than that. Like the soul is a bigger thing, and the body can exist inside and outside it?/A journey is a process of ending up somewhere new. But a new place is only perspective, right? So a place is as much mental as physical. We can go on real journeys in our heads, just like we can go on false journeys overland.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:///>
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_hook=<hook.bookish/poet/60:Instead of that, though, it's here. An earthy, damp scramble of rocks, woods, and waxflies. Intrinsically, I imagine, our bodies and the earth are reflections of each other, <hook2>./Venture beyond it, but also return and be centered in that space, and find balance? And what if the body and the soul are at once remote and conv... uh, holistic, maybe? Holistic./So of [i]course[] we can wander and wind up inside ourselves. Because the separation of all things is at least several parts imaginary. Makes sense, right?>
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:///>
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:And yet, none of that is supported by anything we've seen. How odd.[face:dubious]/<hook.bookish/poet/60:You imagine? Cagey way of phrasing a pretty stark idea./Hm. My response to that is... [i]what[] are you saying?/I'm missing a few cobbles in the path, I guess.>/[face:skeptical]Okay. I'll... stay on this wagon with you. I suppose./==>
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Well then,/<hook.bookish/poet/60:Well but,/I mean it's,/Shh! <hook2>,>/Yes, love, but/==> um, behold!\nA pig has come!
~01~prompt~panel_012~4_narration=It makes itself known to them, shuffling its hindquarters. \nIt purses its ears.
~01~prompt~panel_012~5_action=[actionSmall][gray]guggle
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_hook=Amazing.
~01~prompt~panel_013~4_hook2=[i]Is[] it?
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_action=[tan][actionSmall]gool gool.
~01~prompt~panel_015~5_hook=Pig of my insides, tell me why I've felt so sick since the <season-2>. <hook.greedy/healer/hothead/loner/romantic:What's made me shy to tickle money,/Why's there bone where my heart should be,/What's cast such a gloom on my appetite,/What's given me the bubbling want to talk,/What's made me so hesitant to liplock,> <hook.bookish/coward/goofball/leader/snark:what blearies my old puzzler? My brain, I'm saying./what turns my mucus to mustard?/what turns my laughter rancid?/what stuffs up my whistle?/what curdles the spit in my throat?>
~01~prompt~panel_015~6_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Ah. So you're [i]sick[]. This all makes a lot more sense n--/<hook>, [i]ew.[]/[face:neutral]So you [i]were[] aware./==>
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_speech=[darkGray]Listen tight.
~01~prompt~panel_017~7_hook=Okay.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_speech=[darkGray]<hook.bookish/goofball/hothead/loner/poet/romantic/60:You crave enlightenment, but loveless knowing makes a mind unpliant./If you're after laughter with a warm and loving taste, your tool will be your misfortunes, sweetly cherished. Count them lucky tears--when you live to count them still./To avenge a wound, one must foster its opposite. Go and heal. Bolster families, forge useful or pretty things. Forgive, and dance with your enemies./<hook.mf:He/She/They> who looks for peace by solitude is an engine of <hook.mf:his/her/their> own sorrow. Solitude begets only the friction of self against oblivion./Too reachful for wisdom, you foster its opposite. So there is, in you, a ripe weedpatch of ignorance. Walk there and rough your fingers on those catstongue leaves./Desiring everything, you lose what you grasp. Cup only what you are alive to love, like it's water. You must cup it as consciously as you can. Even then, it drips off your oldening knuckles./The mind is a gardener. An anxious mind gardens fruits of worry: grows them big and admires their bigness. That's fine, but you must be willing to share them with your neighbors. And then turn the ground over.>
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_speech=[darkGray]Oh, and while I've got you... <hook.greedy/loner/snark:If you want lots of money, invest diversely, and never make transactions in a panic./Brush your teeth. Please. Brush them none too gently./Don't eat so much cheese. It's why you're constipated.> <hook.bookish/hothead/romantic:For your eyes, make sure you have plenty of light to read by./Eat and drink slowly, especially if it's right before bedtime./Get your full night's sleep, whenever you can. Focus on breathing to stop your heart racing.>..
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_speech=[darkGray]And finally, kill the parasite-beings that're digging around in your body-matter. That's actually most of the problem.
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_hook2=<hook>... what?
~01~prompt~panel_020~3_hook=[small]Right. I wondered if it was the paraqueens.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_hook2=<hook>, what's...? Why can the pig...? Or what's the para-whatever? Site problem? Hmm?
~01~prompt~panel_021~4_hook=Those bacteria dragons. See? Gnawing my spleen.
~01~prompt~panel_022~4_action=[cherry]Hyosk!
~01~prompt~panel_022~5_action=[actionSmall][orange]hyusk!
~01~prompt~panel_024~4_hook2=Oh.
~01~prompt~panel_025~2_hook=Remember that it's my insides, <hook2>. Be careful where <hook2.weaponType:slash and slicker./you chop and sheer./you club and and smash./you thrust and skewer./you pepper arrows./you fire that thing./you stab that dagger./you stomp your staff./you flick your wand./you cut and blast.>
~01~prompt~panel_025~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:I... guess./I'll... try.../Yes, love.../==>
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~3_narration=Disperse the bacteria-things. Like doctors.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~2_hook=Or--and tell me if this's crazy--but what if we just try talking to the disease?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~1_hook=Medicine-strike!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~2_hook2=Har!!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~3_actionLarge=[cherry]Kyirk!!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~4_action=[cherry]krrm...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~5_action=[actionSmall][orange]hrrm...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~4_hook=I understand you, ill-wreaking dragons. Speak to me.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~3_action=[cherry]hyuk...?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~4_hook=<hook.personality:You struggle. You suck life into yourself, you subsist. And then you multiply. It's how you overcome your own mortality. We're all alike, here, so why should we be enemies?/[face:interested]You're probably as scared as I am, aren't you?/[face:happy]Being parasites seems nice, but what about when I die? Aren't you worried about that? You'll be bringing the roof down on your own heads./[face:skeptical]Being parasites seems nice, but what about when I die? Aren't you worried about that? You'll be bringing the roof down on your own heads./My body is your shelter, isn't it? You must know that if you get greedy with me, your shelter will crumble and die. Is that your wish? Tell me./Lot of times, I get pretty annoyed about a sickness. But now I see you... you're a malice-dry animal, just chasing survival. I can't be mad about that./My body is your shelter, isn't it? You must know that if you get greedy with me, your shelter will crumble and die. Is that your wish? Tell me./[face:grim][i]I'm[] not opposed to you letting you live here. I don't keep much company otherwise. But you're crowding my lungs, you're sludging my innards. Why do you have to do that?/You struggle. You suck life into yourself, you subsist. And then you multiply. It's how you overcome your own mortality. We're all alike, here, so why should we be enemies?/[face:interested]I understand you multiply, you feed. It's your nature, like most animals. But you'll leech me dry, soon, if you keep it up. My idea is just... Let's form a pact, and be familiar. I nourish you, you let me hang onto my life. Yeah?/[face:neutral]Look, I kind of deserve you, really. But I also think, like, I don't [i]actually[] want to let you kill me. So we have to come to an agreement, or we have to fight.>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~5_speech=[green]Explain us the... reason? \nYou display us... compassion?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~6_hook2=[small][i]Everything[] talks.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~5_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:It's the power of having... well, not [i]friends,[] necessarily./It's the power of friends, disease./Guess as I've grown bigger, there's more room in me. And.../===>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~5_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:I've learned it's possible to live and work alongside people we dislike. People that're like diseases unto themselves. Well, and unto everyone else./Friends help us learn to be friends./I've gotten used to holding things in my chest, my soul. It's more room in there than I used to think./===>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~6_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]/Mm, yeah. One of the oldest and most powerful loops, they say./[face:skeptical]<hook>? What exact comparison \nare you making?/===>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~1_speech=[green]<hook.rfln.hook2:B... but... a disease isn't people... we're something else./S... so you're saying... [i]we[] could be friends?/Y... you mean you'll... make space for us too?/==>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:And sometimes that's better! Hey, what I'm saying is, it's worth finding ways to coexist. Even when your own nature tells you it's impossible./I'm absolutely, or basically saying so./The ones we care for... they occupy our hearts like parasites, they leech from our love. But that's okay, because love is limitless!/-->
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]I guess... <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> right? Or nearly./[face:talking]Adverbs don't matter./[face:dubious]Not always./-->
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~1_action=[cherry]...hyuk...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~2_action=[actionSmall][orange]h...yoo?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~3_hook=<hook.personality2:I'm honestly somewhat excited to get your perspective on all my funky anatomy-parts. So.../[face:interested]But the thing is--and remember because this's important: you shouldn't kill me./[face:joy]<hook.rfln.hook2:Hey, and if you'd like me to pass you on to <hook2>, I'll cook my blood into <hook2.mf:his/her/their> dinner, some night![hook2.face:scared]/Oh, and you can let me know what's making all the funky sounds in my stomach sometimes. [i]Perfect![]/Oh, and don't be embarrassed, but me and <hook2> kiss all the time. So I mean, sorry if things get awkward. And I do forbid you from invading [i]<hook2.mf:him/her/them>,[] obviously. /==>/Hey, but just because we let each other live, doesn't mean you've got a free ride. I expect you to pull your weight, and fortify my organs and such./Peace, disease. That's the best way. To support one life is to support all the lives it leans on, and that lean upon it. I think we'll each be stronger in our union than we were in our strife./[face:skeptical]But just remember, you start making my nights miserable and I'll come cut you out. Alright, disease? We understand each other?/Oh, and there's an old bit of glass in my heel. If you can get that, I'll award you a... I don't know. A stomach-patch.[face:skeptical]/As long as you do your thing and let me do mine, you're welcome to feed off of whatever.[face:neutral] That's my arrangement with the earth, and I'm a lot [i]like[] the earth, I'm realizing. Especially to you./Sometimes I think--and this is pretty original, disease, so don't steal it, but--sometimes I think... that all you [i]need[] is love./[face:joke]Yes. And from now on, I'll be a <hook.mf:man/woman/hero> betrayed by <hook.mf:his/her/their> body. An afflicted hero who coughs into <hook.mf:his/her/their> elbow, sometimes, hides the blood, and stares pensively into the ochre skies where a red sun sinks...[hook2.face:dubious]/Yeah, and if you kill me sometime, that's not the [i]worst[] thing. Just make it while I'm asleep, alright?>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_010~1_speech=[green]If we'll trust... we must have you safemake us. From that one, your body's guardian...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_011~3_narration=Behind them, the pig's snuffling turns thunderous and feverhot!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_011~4_hook2=Is it bad?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_011~5_hook=Ah...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_012~7_hook=I guess we... fight?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_012~8_hook2=<hook>, [i]what's[] going on?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_012~9_monster=[darkGray]Your body wants them [i]out!
