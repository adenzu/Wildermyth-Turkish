.longName=The Blinking Game
.name=Event
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook2=...so this <legend.mf:fellow/lady/person> used to pick on you? This <legend.fullname>...?
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook2=<hook2.rfln.hook:<hook.coward.50:You don't usually stand still for that kind of thing.../You don't tend to just roll over, usually...>/What's the deal with that?/Wish I'd been there for you./What's the deal with that?>
~01~prompt~panel_003.(hook_is_hothead_>_70)~1_hook=Just hearing <legend.mf:his/her/their> name, my blood gets going.
~01~prompt~panel_004.(hook_NOT_hothead)~1_hook=Well, I used to give as much as I got, to be honest.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook=<hook.hothead.70:<hook.rfln.hook2:Because of just how angry it makes me./Not in, like, a weird way./Um... I only mean.../---.>/Not that I enjoyed it...>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=Well okay, what it was... we had this game we would play. To challenge each other. A blinking game.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook2=<hook2.bookish/goofball/snark:Doesn't sound inherently vicious...?/Oh, that sounds... kind of fun?/Oh, I'm sure you never took [i]that []too far, did you?> What kind of rules did you have?
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=What?
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook=Well, the whole point was about... You're put in a situation and... And whoever blinks first loses. So that meant...
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook2=There weren't any rules?
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hook=Basically.
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_hook2=Just going farther and farther until one of you backed down. Right?
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hook2=So... something happened? What was it?
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_hook=Oh, um... Well, the last time it happened, I ended up winning. But something went wrong. I didn't mean for <legend> to get hurt quite so badly, and...
~01~prompt~panel_018.(hook2_is_loner_>_60)~1_hook2=Whoa.
~01~prompt~panel_019.(hook2_NOT_loner)~1_hook2=Wait, this is horrifying!
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_hook=Well, yeah. <hook.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark:I wasn't good at making judgments, in those days. Thinking things all the way through./So I've lived with that in the back of my mind. That <legend.mf:he/she/they> might come after me sometime.../And no, it wasn't funny. I think we both were under the impression it was all ultimately harmless, but..../And it was stupid, I know it was. We didn't get anything out of it, it was just about pride./I tried to do what I could for <legend.mf:him/her/them>, but <legend.mf:he/she/they> wouldn't take help from me. I get why.../I was younger then. We were both reckless, and it was bound to happen. But you have to understand, I wasn't going to lose./It's not something I'm proud of, but it happened. I've just moved forward and tried to be better, but.../I'm not always good at understanding where lines are drawn. And so... anyway./You carry that kind of thing with you, right? It becomes a stone on your back. As for <legend>.../<hook.rfln.hook2:I don't like telling you, but it feels important, now. Don't spread it around to the others./It's the kind of thing that keeps you up at night, sends you out for wine when you should be asleep.../I never wanted to tell you, because I didn't want you to look at me differently, but.../--->/Can I say I learned from it? No, not really. It just kind of makes me sour with myself. As for <legend>...> I haven't seen <legend.mf:him/her/them> or heard from <legend.mf:him/her/them> since that time.
~01~prompt~panel_021~2_hook=...<hook2>?
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_hook2=Are you serious right now? <hook2.rfln.hook:I can't believe I let you rope me into this!/And this is what I signed on for?/And I should just let you go through with this?/--->
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_hook2=So, I'm <hook>. <hook.rfln.hook2:I'm still captivated by my bully from forever ago, who I brutally injured in a dumb macho game.../My friend and I decided abusing each other would be hilarious! Oh, oops! Turns out it sucks to get randomly maimed for no reason./I've got this weird fascination with a <legend.mf:guy/girl/person> from my past. We tried to hurt each other, and often succeeded./--->
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:...so now I'm going to travel halfway across the world just so the bastard can get <legend.mf:his/her/their> revenge. <legend.mf:His/Her/Their> super-obvious, trap-shaped revenge. Is that it?/Oh, what's that? <legend.mf:He wants/She wants/They want> revenge? Good luck to <legend.mf:him/her/them>! See what <legend.mf:he does/she does/they do> when I walk straight into <legend.mf:his/her/their> trap! /Hey, <legend.mf:he/she/they> sent me a party invitation. I guess I'll stumble into <legend.mf:his/her/their> trap now./--->
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_hook=How about the part where I didn't ask you to come with me!?
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_hook2=Did I miss anything?
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_action=[actionLarge][white]click![]
~01~prompt~panel_031~1_hook=<hook2>...
~01~prompt~panel_031~2_self=...<hook2>'s foot has pressed a concealed trigger. Removing it will likely spring a hidden trap.
~01~prompt~panel_032~1_hook2=Any shift of weight, any movement might release it...
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook=<hook> rushes to knock <hook2> from the trap, taking <hook2.mf:his/her/their> place.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=Just hold on, I'll look for a way to disarm it!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~1_hook=With all the speed and strength <hook.mf:he/she/they> can muster, <hook> charges to throw <hook2> clear...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~1_self=[b][actionLarge]Thwung![][]
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~2_narration=A bolt flies from a concealed mechanism in a nearby stump.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~1_hook=It strikes <hook.mf:him/her/them> in the face.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~1_hook2=<hook>!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~1_hook=Just get ready! There's always one more wrinkle.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~1_hook=Sure enough...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~1_hook2=<hook2>, unable to remain motionless any longer, attempts to throw <hook2.mf:his/her/their> body clear.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~1_self=[b][actionLarge]Thwung![][]
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~2_narration=A bolt flies from a concealed mechanism in a nearby stump.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~1_hook=<hook2>!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~1_hook2=Well, that'll be a scar...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~2_narration=<hook2.mf:He rolls/She rolls/They roll> to <hook2.mf:his/her/their> feet, bleeding profusely, but still breathing.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~1_hook=It's not over yet...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~4_hook=Always one more wrinkle.
