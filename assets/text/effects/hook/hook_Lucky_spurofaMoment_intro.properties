You're at a festival!/There's a whole table of cheeses. \nSomething wrong with the festival?/[face:joke]What's wrong, <hook2>? It's a festival! Get in the mood!/[face:neutral]Not one for festivals<hook.rfln.hook2://, are you/>?/[face:happy]Hey, <hook2>... you know it's a festival? \nWhy aren't you dancing?/<hook2>? <hook.rfln.hook2:So, uh... Festival's not your scene?/Are you always glum about a festival?/Thought you said you were \nlooking forward to the festival./>>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Huh. <hook.greedy/loner/60:[face:joke]Well, I'm going for a refill./[face:grim]I make the effort. You can too./[face:skeptical]Well then just go home...>/Yeah? <hook.greedy/loner/60:[face:joke]Go home then! \nMore drinks for me!/[face:grim]I actually feel the same./[face:skeptical]Well you don't have \nto stay...>/Sorry, love. <hook.greedy/loner/60:[face:joke]I'm actually\ngoing for a refill./[face:grim]I understand.

~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook2=<hook2.personality:What's the point? No one's having conversations. Just songs and jokes./[face:skeptical]I'm preoccupied, I suppose. The stuff we've seen this past year.../[face:skeptical]I don't know, I usually like this kind of thing. Just not feeling it tonight./[face:skeptical]What festival? More like a waste of food. \nCan they afford this?/[face:interested]I... don't know what's wrong. I just can't seem to feel the spirit. Worrying, I suppose./[face:angry]This is no festival. There's no gladiator cage. And where's the lion versus snake pit? What am I supposed to even [i]do[] here?/It's not for me. Not tonight. Blood stains every horizon, doesn't it? Can't afford to let our guard down./[talking]It's the [i]people's[] festival. I'm not \nreally one of them./I thought we'd have poets here. Storytellers. That song they're singing is [i]so[] unoriginal./[face:dubious]You'd think there'd be one or two <hook2.awm:lookworthy ladies/lookworthy hunks> at a festival. Why else do people go?/[face:dubious]Honestly? I'd rather be anywhere else. A forest. A cave. The inside of a shark.>

~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook=<hook.personality:A game of chance then? Might be stimulating./[face:interested]There's a dice table. If you want.../Well, I spot a dice table. Care to take me on?/I could roll you up in a dice game if you want./[face:interested]A dice game might \nbe good.

~01~prompt~panel_009~2_hook2=It was [i]lucky[].

~01~prompt~panel_011~2_hook2=Honestly, though, do you have a secret? \nI've never seen someone roll [i]that[] well.
~01~prompt~panel_012~4_hook=No secret. I get on these streaks, sometimes.\nCards, dice, coins. But now you mention it...
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_hook2=A direction?
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hook=I've always wondered what would happen if we were to just pick a direction.
~01~prompt~panel_015~4_hook=Just pick a direction and go. If I'm really on a hot streak... \nwell I bet you we'll find a magic item somewhere!
~01~prompt~panel_015~5_hook2=A magic item? Seriously?
