~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The guardian falls, its great stone knees clattering apart, rolling in the moss.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=The wheeling rocks gather dust and shadows as they settle... until they look like they've rested there for centuries.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=The glade goes calm.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=And then <npc> starts to fade...
~01~~panel_003~2_narration=The wrapped body of <npc2>, across \n<npc.mf:his/her/their> lap, seems to lose its substance.
~01~~panel_003~7_npc=Goddess?
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=<npc.mf:He has/She has/They have> time to say...
~01~~panel_004~7_npc=Thank you, friends.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=And <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> gone.
~01~~panel_007~8_hook=Well, now [i]that's[] done.
~01~~panel_007~9_hook2=Mm.
~01~~panel_008~5_hook2=Where's the ox got to?
~01~~panel_008~6_hook=Yeah... good thinking.
~01~~panel_009~2_narration=They find it, not far off, lowing pleasantly and munching clover.
~01~~panel_011~1_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/healer/leader/poet/60:This is the world, up here. The world we know. But now it's \ntempting to ask... How many other worlds are there?/[face:interested]You know, I think I'd rather forget what just happened. \nBut I doubt I'll be able to./[face:grim]I do hope we made the right decision. I hope <npc.mf:he/she/they>\nand <npc2> are together, and happy./[face:grim]We all have to choose and walk our own paths \nthrough this world. Couldn't deny <npc.mf:him/her/them> that./[face:sad]Here's the same sun that shone on <npc.mf:his/her/their> birth. Shone on <npc.mf:his/her/their> neck, when <npc.mf:he/she/they> took the road to town. But never again./Nice. The world's still here.>

I think there's seven others./You can think whatever you want, I guess.>/[face:dubious]Not exactly the words of a loving friend./[face:grim]<hook2.coward/snark/60:[face:interested]Don't even say that. It had to be the right decision, or what did we just do?/[face:dubious]Now's a great time to wonder, isn't it?/We'll never know, I guess. Which is probably for the best.>/[face:grim]I don't know who you're trying to convince./<hook2.goofball/bookish/poet/60:[face:skeptical]Well what if it [i]isn't[] the same?/[face:skeptical]You're making assumptions, again. What if it [i]isn't[] the same?/[face:grim]And unlike the sun, you had the power to pull <npc.mf:him/her/them> back. But you didn't, did you?/[face:dubious]You're going to be talking like this the whole trip home, aren't you?>/<hook2.snark.60:[face:dubious]Low bar you have for success, isn't it?/[face:skeptical]You're impossible to get along with, you know that?>>/<hook.bookish/coward/healer/leader/poet/60:<hook2.bookish/goofball/poet/60:[face:interested]I've wondered that all my life, but yes. Seeing <npc> disappear like that... drives you to dig deeper, doesn't it?/[face:talking]Twelve. There's twelve others. One of them's all made of cake./[face:interested]Sometimes I'm swayed by an idle intuition... that there's as many worlds as there are minds to imagine them./[face:skeptical]I suppose it's a question you could ask. After a few drinks, maybe...>/[face:talking]<hook2.healer/loner/60:Naw, forgetting's not worth it. If you need to talk though, I'm here./[face:grim]Forgetting's not impossible. Just have to remember \nto do it every night./Just remember the friend. And the passion that moved <npc.mf:him/her/them>. That's worthy of being happy for.>/[face:skeptical]It's going to be difficult to ever know for sure, isn't it?/[face:interested]I'm with you. Just find it tough to... think about, I guess. We all did what we did. They're in the hands of a goddess, now./<hook2.healer/poet/60:[face:happy]And it's beautiful and warm. I'm sure <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> warm, also./[face:interested]We'll remember <npc.mf:him/her/them>. The sun will rise and fall over all of us. It may shine wherever <npc.mf:he's/she's/they've> gone./[face:grim]Love means more to us than sunlight, doesn't it?>/<hook2.goofball.60:[face:interested]Appears to be. With all it's worldly things intact./[face:skeptical]For us, it is. This world. And all we know.>>/<hook.bookish/coward/healer/leader/poet/60:<hook2.romantic.60:[face:happy]With you, I'd walk them all, and never tire./[face:happy]I love when you get that curious light in your eye...>/<hook2.romantic.60:[face:sad]Come to my arms, then. I'll always help you forget./[face:talking]It'll be alright. I'll cook up some bacon. There's mushrooms under those elm trees, up ahead.>/[face:talking]I believe they are. I think you do too. Unfortunately, there's only [i]believing[], sometimes./[face:talking]It was the right thing, love. That old goddess will care for them like her own children./[face:happy]The same sun that saw us meet. The same one that will see us die. Together, as long as possible./<hook2.romantic.60:[face:happy]My world walks beside me. <hook.mf:He's a brave man/She's a brave woman/They're a brave soul>. One I'd follow anywhere./[face:skeptical]It's all in front of us, isn't it? Until it isn't.>>/-->

~01~~panel_016~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Hey. That light's annoying./<hook2>? Still awake?/You're up, still? Reading?/-->
~01~~panel_017~2_hook2=I picked these up around the stones. Where <npc>\ndisappeared. Didn't even think about it.
~01~~panel_018~3_hook2=I'm making notes...
~01~~panel_021~1_narration=They return to the farm <npc> and <npc2> once built. They set things in order, and see that it passes to a worthy family.
~01~~panel_021~2_narration=Then they're on their way again.
~01~~panel_022~3_narration=The road is pale, splotched and torn in places with ruts and grass.\nStretches of the journey are entirely wordless.
~01~~panel_023~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]<hook2.loner.60:[face:grim]Ah well. One less friend \nwe have in common, now./Blustery weather's coming back.>/<hook2.loner.60:[face:grim]Putting too much into a single house... Who knows \nwhere you'll live in five years.

~01~~panel_026~2_hook=...I don't know.
~01~~panel_027~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]Hm./[face:sad]Yeah./[face:interested]Me too./-->
~01~~panel_027~2_hook=Mm.
~01~~panel_027~3_narration=A road the color of old canvas billows in front of them, behind them.
