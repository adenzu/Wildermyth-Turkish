~01~~panel_001~2_hook2=<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:skeptical]Underwhelming morphology for something that would bring down a Gorgon. Consider me skeptical.../[face:interested]Were they that dangerous? Maybe they carry some kind of toxin. Maybe they gave it to [i]us[].../[face:joke]I like what they did with the place. Pretty atmospheric, a blue-lit corpse./A trio of crows can chase off a hawk. \nAnd they're not exactly [i]crow-sized[]./[face:happy]Doubtful. I'd say it's the work of a hero. A blind brave <hook2.awm:woman/man> with a golden saber and hair like opals. Mmm.../Skulky little heroes, if they [i]did[] manage it.[face:skeptical]/Could be. More I see, more I have to shrug at the limits of what's possible.>
~01~~panel_002~3_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/leader/60:Curious. Think they just wandered in here? Or did they actually [i]kill[] the thing? /[face:joy]Those two knuckleheads killed our guardian?/[face:talking]Two's probably not all there is. Think those two could've killed our guardian?/[face:interested]Those what killed our guardian, you think? Kind of surprising.>
~01~~panel_003~3_hook=You ready to get out of here, <npc>?
~01~~panel_003~4_npc=I'm already moving!
~01~~panel_004~5_narration=They file from the cave, each shuffling through their own thoughts.
~01~~panel_005~4_npc=<npc2>, I'm sorry. We got what we came for, just... \nToo late to save Father. Our family met hard fates.
~01~~panel_006~4_npc=Would you? I'd appreciate that. Somewhere in the sun, at least. Somewhere <npc2.mf:he/she/they> can feel sun, rain, and breeze.
~01~~panel_006~5_hook2=We'll come back and move <npc2.mf:him/her/them>, if you like. Carry <npc2.mf:him/her/them> to a better place of rest.
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=They mark their way out, making sure those who return can find <npc>'s <npc2.mf:brother/sister/sibling>.
~01~~panel_007~3_narration=The forest smells sweeter than before.
~01~~panel_008~10_npc=You look good, <hook>. If you feel like it, we'll forgo the elixir.
~01~~panel_008~11_hook=We can try that. Thank you...
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=Camp that night is on the edge of the woods.
~01~~panel_009~10_narration=<npc> sleeps early.
~01~~panel_009~2_narration=<hook> and <hook2> stay up to watch the fire fade into its embers.
~01~~panel_010~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Can I tell you something?/<hook2>, you know.../[face:interested]<hook2>, you're so beautiful. Um.../---> When I held that crystal, <hook.bookish/coward/poet/60:a fascinating thing occurred./something frightening happened. Or.../a moment of transcendence overtook me./I got this weird sensation...> Something happened, long ago. There were Queens and cities. And an empire beneath the sea. Gorgons. Were betrayed. By... I don't know. It's weird. The miracle magic came from the ocean.
~01~~panel_012~14_hook2=You're all better, yeah? That [i]Igochorra[] thing? It's done?
~01~~panel_012~15_hook=I... yeah. Feels like it.
~01~~panel_013~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Well, don't be getting sick again.[face:dubious]/I can hear it in your voice. I'm glad.[face:happy]/[face:sad]I hated thinking... were [i]you[] worried?/--->
~01~~panel_014~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:happy]I'll try to accomodate you./[face:happy]Never knew how glad [i]I'd[] be.\nTo know things weren't ending./I thought about everything ending.\nI really didn't want it to end./--->
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=From time to time, <hook.mf:he/she/they>'ll dream of a world beneath the sea. <hook.mf:He/She/They>'ll wake in a well of blue bottomless sorrow, until <hook.mf:he recognizes/she recognizes/they recognize> the sky.
~01~~panel_015~2_narration=The disease's vestiges are wiped and gone from <hook>'s body. \nIn fact, the cure has left <hook.mf:him/her/them> stronger.
