~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hook2=Oh wandering stranger, come hide from the moon,\nThe barrels are full and the fiddles in tune,
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:joke]/[face:joy]/[face:happy]/--->Come ask the barkeep for a bowl, cup, and spoon,\nWe'll dance you to sleep or we'll drink until noon!

~01~prompt~panel_005~2_hook2=<hook2.personality:It's a fairly old song. I think it's northern. Here, the/Why...? You look worried. The/Aw, come on. It wasn't [i]that[] bad, was it? The/You trying to steal my good mood? Here, the/Sorry, I was just, uh... the/What's wrong, no songs in you? Here, the/I keep a few songs in my pocket. The/What? I can sing, sometimes. The/Alright, it's not fine poetry, I suppose. The/It's in the <town> tavern every night.\nYou haven't heard it? The/[face:joy]You look like you just heard me sing. But here, the> chorus is better...
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook=<hook2> glances at a gleam.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=<hook> realizes the dagger in <hook.mf:his/her/their> hand is flashing with the mixed light of moon and fire.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_hook=Oh! It's nothing, it's...
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook=Though <hook.mf:he clutches/she clutches/they clutch> it away, <hook.mf:his/her/their> <hook.rfln.hook2:rival/friend/partner/---> has already gotten a good look.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hook2=It's got the mark of Oldwane.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=It's too late to deny it. The vision of the blade, once beheld, can never be forgotten.
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_hook=<hook2>...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hook=The rippling edge is oddly arresting. The Oldwane family's grim crest glares,\ngraven into the hilt.
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_action=I didn't mean to let you \n  see it.
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_action=[actionSmall][gray]But what I intend seems to \n     weigh little in its gravity.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook=<hook.personality:My friend studied this artifact--the Oath of Oldwane, it's sometimes called--and it drove <hook.mf:him/her/them> insane, eventually killed <hook.mf:him/her/them>./This dagger has haunted me a long time. I had a friend who... I can't tell you the story without breaking... but.../I had a friend. <hook.mf:He was/She was/They were> the funniest person I've ever met. Found this knife in a pawnshop, and <hook.mf:he/she/they> changed. Turned hateful, sick. Eventually died./A friend from before left it to me. It's a relic <hook.mf:he/she/they> hunted since we were young and knew what it was to desire things. It killed <hook.mf:him/her/them>./There are diseases of the soul, <hook2>... This knife breeds them. Its twisting influence corrupted my good friend, then killed <hook.mf:her/him/them>. It's passed to me, now./I don't normally go in for these stories. But this dagger's evil. It killed my friend, and now it's in my hands./I had a good friend, as pure-hearted as anyone. <hook.mf:She/He/They> went to destroy this blade... instead, it destroyed <hook.mf:her/him/them>. And now it's up to me./Darkness is in every heart already, right? No evil magic required for that. But this blade somehow makes that darkness grow. Until it kills. My only friend from way back... anyway, <hook.mf:she/he/they> passed it to me./If there was ever a solidified, tangible form of evil, this dagger is it. It killed the friend who left it to me. It could burn our world to cinders./I had a friend. A beautiful <hook.awm:girl/boy> with a golden heart. This knife entered <hook.awm:her/his> possession, and twisted <hook.awm:her/him>. Destroyed <hook.awm:her/him> from the inside out. So I took it. I.../It's just an old butter-cleaver. My dead friend left it to me. \nThe weird thing about it... it could probably unspool creation.>

~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook=According to legend, this weapon, the Oath of Oldwane, was made by the last persecuted Oldwane mystic.
~01~prompt~panel_014~3_hook=It was made for vengeance, to cause suffering. It ruined a whole age of our land, shattered what generations had built.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_hook=So now... I need to make sure that doesn't happen again.
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_hook2=That's where we're headed, isn't it? To destroy that thing?
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]You're not needed. I mean, you can turn back, if it's too much.../[face:grim]Do you still want to come along? I know it's dangerous./[face:grim]Love, I should've told you from the outset, I'm sorry. You can go back./> I intended to slip away once we got close.

~02~choice_yes~panel_001~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:talking]I'm not sure I trust you to finish the job./[face:talking]You're not scaring [i]me[] off <hook>.\nSounds like you'll need a friend./Sounds like you'll need me on the way. \nBut maybe even more at the end./>
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=In fact... I don't think the time is right.
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
