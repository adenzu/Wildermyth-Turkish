.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> have arrived at <site>.
.longName=Serious Trouble
.name=Event
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Standing above <site>, <hook> and <hook2> attempt to hatch a plan.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=<hook.coward/hothead/snark:My best idea is that we wait until they're all asleep, and we creep in quietly, grab <legend>, and sneak back out./So how about this: we storm in, kill all the bad guys, and rescue <legend>./[face:skeptical]No matter what we do, we're going to end up fighting someone, aren't we?>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook2=<hook.coward/hothead/snark:That would be a good idea if <legend.mf:his/her/their> captors were sleepy guardsmen from a storybook. Since they appear to actually be <foes.plural>.../That does sound like your kind of a plan./I'd like to say that's not true, but I don't see a way around it.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook=<hook.coward/hothead/snark:Well, do they look sleepy...?/It's just crazy enough to work...!/One way to go would be to flood this entire valley, digging channels all the way back to the river over the course of the next few weeks...>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook2=We're not doing that, okay?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook=So, <hook.rfln.hook2:you don't actually want to rescue....?/you have an excellent alternative, I imagine?/what's your plan, my dear?/--->
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook2=<hook2.hothead/healer/goofball/60:[face:angry]I'm thinking!/[face:sad]I've... still got to think of something./[face:skeptical]Poison the... air?/[face:grim]I have a... Give me a minute.>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=You know... when I'm trying to avoid danger to my own self... <hook.coward/hothead/romantic:say when I've upset someone and I don't want to get punched.../you know, after I've shouted lots of obscene names at someone for no good reason.../like when I've been flirting with <hook.rfln.hook2:your <hook2.awm:girlfriend/boyfriend>/whoever people don't want me to flirt with/some <hook.awm:girl/guy> I'm not supposed to/--->...>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=What I do is I create a distraction. Crack a joke, or start a different argument, offer a drink or...
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook2=A diversion. But what do you have in mind? Don't say dancing.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook=We start a fire up on this hill. But the fire is a joke! And then we get 'em!
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=...we fight naked! They'll be too embarrassed to hit us!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~1_hook2=I suppose it... could work. Is that safe? Possible we just end up cooked and overwhelmed?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~1_hook=What part about starting fires and ambushing <foes.plural> sounds dangerous to you?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~1_hook=Let's get blazing my <hook.rfln.hook2:obnoxious friend!/friend!/love!/---> Your <legend.mf:nephew/niece> is as good as saved!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~1_hook2=Oh? Well what about my cousin?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~1_hook2=Because... <legend>'s my cousin.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~1_hook2=Well, actually that's a good idea. You take your clothes off and distract them. I'll keep mine on and knock them out one by one.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~1_hook=So should we just try a regular ambush?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~1_hook2=Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
