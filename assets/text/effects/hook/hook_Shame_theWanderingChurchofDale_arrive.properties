.name=Event
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=I've never met a holy pilgrim.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=Over the course of the journey, the disease hasn't left <hook>'s body.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=But <hook.mf:his/her/their> health [ni]has[] returned, little by little, with the elixir <npc>'s brewed.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook=You're a pilgrim of the Wandering Church, aren't you? <hook.bookish/goofball/greedy/healer/loner/snark/60:Naturally, you must have [i]some[] divergent mythologies./[face:happy]So does your god just give poor directions? Oh! Do you have holy shoes?/There's got to be some benefits to that, I'm sure.../[face:interested]I do apologize if I'm prying. I mean no disrespect./Probably have obligations, right? Big gatherings?/Or is that all a euphemism I never understood...?/You make a lot of folks curious, I'd imagine.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_npc=Your cheeks look less sunken. Glad to see you eating more.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_npc=I remember this forest. It's been all my life, and I haven't returned. So it's almost like <npc2.mf:he's/she's/they're> alive again. My <npc2.mf:brother/sister/sibling>.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=They're nearing their destination: an ancient shrine to the sea, where the fabled restorative is said to be housed.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=Night knocks them off their knees.
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_narration=A short, salty dinner. A stiff drink and a draught of medicine.
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_narration=Sleep.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_narration=They wake to mill in the cold dawn, achey and oddly anxious.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=You asked me, yesterday, <hook>... About being a pilgrim.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hook=Yeah, but if you...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc=My <npc2.mf:brother/sister/sibling> and I, I told you we went after the cure together? Well, the man we were set on retrieving it for... he was our father. In failing, I lost them both.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_npc=I was overcome with... you know. So many feelings. Guilt, mostly. That I'd led my <npc2.mf:brother/sister/sibling>... <npc2>. I'd led <npc2> to <npc2.mf:his/her/their> death. And for nothing.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_npc=In the end, it was for nothing. \nA great cosmic joke.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_narration=They pack up their camp in quiet, and set out again.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_npc=My <npc2.mf:brother/sister/sibling>... <npc2.personality:was the cleverest, you know? <npc2.mf:He/She/They>.../tended to fear the forest. Came along, despite that.../<npc2.mf:his/her/their> easy laughter would've eased Father's passing.../dreamt of riches, fame. Threw that away for this insane quest.../always gave of <npc2.mf:himself/herself/themself> to help others. Was [i]happy[] to.../rushed in, perhaps. Though <npc2.mf:he/she/they> could take on anything.../always roped me into things. Just had that... charisma./always a little shy, but in a strong way. Pensive./had a gift for language. Even as children./so imaginative, sure of life's beauty. Savored stories./funny kid. Too smart for <npc2.mf:his/her/their> age. Sarcastic.> Anyway...
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_npc=Anyway, I dropped my heart in a well of hatred.\nI'll spare you those evil blank stories.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_npc=But I met [i]my[] pilgrim, one day. <npc4>, <npc4.mf:he was/she was/they were> called. One of Dale's wanderers. Dale, our god, our goddess. Dale.
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_npc4=[tan]Come. Walk with me.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_npc=That's all <npc4.mf:he/she/they> said! That's all anyone needed to say! I was young, still. I'd been torturing myself and the world.
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_narration=The unusually sinuous track that winds between the trees leads beneath a rocky overhang, into the belly of a cliffside and down.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_npc=Old <npc4> taught me about Dale, <npc4.mf:his/her/their> god. Not to force me to change, but to affix before me... a kind of star. Dale is woman and man, thing and idea. All is in Dale, and Dale is in all. Thus, wandering amongst all is joy. Keeping a journal of your journeys is worship.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_npc4=[tan]All paths lead us where we must be.\nThe whim and the will are no different.\nAll I do is love. Love where my feet carry me.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_npc=I didn't believe it quickly. But gradually. The steps we took. Seasons, then years.
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_npc=By the time we came back to my hometown... I wasn't angry anymore. Even at myself. Sorrowful. Bitter in moments. But aware, as I'd never been, of all the love I'd been given. All the love I still had a chance to give back.
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_npc=And I...
~01~prompt~panel_023~3_hook=Stay back, <npc>.
~01~prompt~panel_023~4_npc=Hm?
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_npc=Oh. But that's... <npc2>? My <npc2.mf:brother/sister/sibling>. Standing exactly as <npc2.mf:he/she/they>... \nas <npc2.mf:he/she/they> stood when it struck <npc2.mf:him/her/them>. Why's... I mean... what's...?
~01~prompt~panel_024~2_hook2=<hook2.coward.60:[face:interested]Uh, I think... come look./Come take a look at this.>
~01~prompt~panel_025~4_hook=<hook.coward/healer/hothead/60:[face:sad]I'm sorry. Maybe stick close, though? For now...?/[face:talking]Come along. Things will be okay, just stay close./No time to dawdle. Stay alert./Be strong right now. Stay by us.>
~01~prompt~panel_025~5_npc=Hm? Mm.
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_hook2=This may be our vaunted guardian...
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_hook2=...what's left of it, anyway.
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_npc=I remember the thing... snaking, moving. \nAlive. The terror of its forgefire eyes.
~01~prompt~panel_028~2_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Matches mythic descriptions of the mighty Gorgons. A rare sight./[face:interested]Certainly [i]looks[] horrific. Glad we don't have to face it./[face:joy]Dead monsters are a lot \nless scary, I've found./Teaches you what terror's good for. [i]Everything[] can be killed./[face:skeptical]Not moving now. We're lucky./[face:skeptical]I definitely prefer [i]this[]. \nHow about you?/It's alright. You won't have \nto face it again.>
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_hook2=<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/loner/snark/60:Well someone [i]killed[] it. And left its altar intact./Who killed it and left its treasure alone?/Yeah, but who killed it? And left this altar alone?/But by [i]who[]? This altar looks untouched./Who killed it? This altar looks pristine./But how'd it die? This altar's untouched./Whoever killed it... didn't touch this altar.>
~01~prompt~panel_030~2_hook=So that's the cure? <npc>? What'd you call this sickness I've contracted?
~01~prompt~panel_030~3_npc=Nnn?
~01~prompt~panel_032~4_npc=It's called... [i]Igochorra[]. The word is Thnarric, it's...
~01~prompt~panel_032~5_hook2=And this remedy?
~01~prompt~panel_033~1_npc=I don't know. The story's old. A restorative of some kind, that could be used to heal any malady... It's hard to compare a legend to a hunk of glowing salt. Book I read described it as a 'gift from the sea, answered with treachery.' A single crystalized miracle.
~01~prompt~panel_033~2_narration=Close to the crystal, unless they're imagining it, \nthey hear the noise of playful waves and ribboning wind.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~2_npc=This is why we crossed paths.\nI'm happy it'll go to you.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~3_darken=Use to heal <hook>.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~4_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:interested]/[face:happy]/[face:sad]/--->
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=Heal [i]any[] malady? Really?
~03~choice_no~panel_001~2_darken=Use to try and restore <npc>'s <npc2.mf:brother/sister/sibling>.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~2_narration=<hook> lifts the crystal off its altar. \n<hook.humanSkin_naturalLeftHand:It threads <hook.mf:his/her/their> knuckles with spirals of light./>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~3_hook=The light feels... damp.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~4_hook2=<hook2.hothead/leader/loner/poet/snark/60:[face:skeptical]So, what, you have to eat it or something?/[face:skeptical]Just be wary, alright?/[face:interested]Never seen anything quite like that.../[face:interested]A dazzling apple plucked from the tree of stars./[face:interested]Definitely [i]looks[] how a miracle should./[face:skeptical]What's it like? Do you feel anything?>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~3_hook=Do I just...?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~5_npc=Try [i]thinking[] it. The illness, then the cure.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~6_hook2=<hook2.coward/healer/60:Nothing [i]bad[] could happen, right? Seems odd, just picking up and... I mean, isn't it?/Don't worry, though. Give it time, we'll figure it out./Is that really all you can suggest? What does [i]thinking[] it even mean?[face:skeptical]>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~1_narration=<hook> holds the crystal close.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~2_narration=<hook.mf:He visualizes/She visualizes/They visualize> <hook.mf:his/her/their> own insides, or <hook.mf:tries/tries/try> to.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~3_narration=<hook.mf:Pretends/Pretends/Pretending> to see the illness, green and hairy among the red arches of <hook.mf:his/her/their> chest.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~1_narration=For some reason, then, <hook.mf:he imagines/she imagines/they imagine> a scouring wave.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~1_narration=It becomes true in <hook.mf:him/her/them>, like a memory.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~2_narration=Salt and water, chill and churning as the earth deepdown moves, lurching wildly and massively and silent.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~1_narration=The crystal in <hook.mf:his/her/their> hands fountains light. Coarse seawater seems to rush in <hook.mf:his/her/their> system.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_007~1_narration=The brilliance overflows around them until...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_008~2_narration=...in another instant, it drains away. The crystal has dissolved to nothing. A briney mist clings to the air.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~4_hook2=<hook>? Are you...?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~5_hook=Not sure. At least I'm alive.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~1_action=[aqua]...sproooowww...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~2_action=[purple]...sproooowww...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~3_narration=Just then, a hungry growl emerges from the shadows beyond the Gorgon remains. It's echoed by a second unseen mouth.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_011~1_npc=You hear that!? Is it more of them!?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_011~2_hook2=Get behind us.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_001~2_narration=<hook> lifts the crystal off its altar.\n<hook.humanSkin_naturalLeftHand:It threads <hook.mf:his/her/their> knuckles with spirals of light./>
~06~player_chose_no~panel_001~3_hook=The light feels... damp.

Do you feel anything?>
~06~player_chose_no~panel_002~3_hook=But someone else has first claim.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_003~4_hook2=<hook>...?
~06~player_chose_no~panel_003~5_npc=<hook.mf:Where's he/Where's she/Where are they>...?
~06~player_chose_no~panel_004~6_hook=<hook.personality:[face:talking]Part of me is only curious. Will this cure you? And who will you be when you awaken? I [i]have[] to know./[face:sad]I know what this probably means for me... but you're just a <npc2.mf:boy/girl/child>. Only we wish we had two of these things./I've [i]got[] to stop you making that annoying face. This should help./[face:grim]If this [i]does[] cure you... well, you'll definitely owe me./[face:happy]Here we are, poor <npc2.mf:boy/girl/child>. Your life was interrupted young... here's a chance to reclaim it./[face:angry]Courage like yours deserves another chance to burn. Here's hoping this glowy rock's as magical as it's supposed to be./[face:talking]You were brave enough to seek this out, face the danger. Whatever power it has should be given to you, if it's possible./[face:grim]The world needs people like you, more than it needs... well. Anyway. I guess maybe it won't even do anything./[face:interested]What [i]you[] sacrificed... If a breathing body can be made stone, surely stone can be made to breathe again./[face:happy]Can't help but be overcome... to see the bravery etched in your eyes, your mouth. I just hope your face will feel tears again, and blush, sleep, grow old./[face:dubious]Alright, alright, stop shouting out here. \nTry some of this...>

~06~player_chose_no~panel_006~8_npc=Oh, no, <hook>, it won't w... or I don't think it...
~06~player_chose_no~panel_006~9_hook=We'll see.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_007~10_narration=<hook> holds the crystal close to the stone <npc2.mf:man/woman/person>. <hook.mf:He forms/She forms/They form> and forces all the weight of <hook.mf:his/her/their> will into a single idea, a miracle, reversing whatever change wrought cold rock from once warm skin and muscle.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_007~11_narration=Icy, radiant slivers drip from the crystal's core.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_007~7_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:sad]/-->
~06~player_chose_no~panel_008~10_narration=The crystal in <hook>'s hand shrinks to nearly nothing. Another glance finds it entirely dissolved.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_008~11_narration=Sound, to all of them, becomes warped and blue. Gloms and layers of light find invisible cracks and filter beneath <npc2.mf:the man's/the woman's/the person's> stone flesh.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_008~7_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:sad]/[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/-->
~06~player_chose_no~panel_009~10_narration=One last wave of crashing brilliance submerges them...
~06~player_chose_no~panel_010~10_narration=...and drains away.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_010~11_narration=A briney-smelling mist clings to the air.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_011~13_npc=<npc2>... are you...?
~06~player_chose_no~panel_012~1_npc=I'm [i]much[] too old! But it's me.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_012~2_npc2=<npc>? You're... No, you're too old.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_013~1_hook2=[i]Something's[] woken up.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_014~1_action=[aqua]...sproooowww...
~06~player_chose_no~panel_014~2_action=[purple]...sproooowww...
~06~player_chose_no~panel_014~3_narration=Just then, a hungry growl emerges from the shadows beyond the Gorgon remains. It's echoed by another unseen mouth.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_015~3_hook=We'll meet you at the mouth of the gully. Go on.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_015~4_npc2=Hm? But I can...
~06~player_chose_no~panel_015~5_npc=Come on, <npc2>. [face:sad]\nNot this time.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_016~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:You're an idiot, you know?[face:dubious]/That was pretty brave, <hook>.[face:interested]/[face:sad]What you just did... we're not... I mean I'm not.../--->
