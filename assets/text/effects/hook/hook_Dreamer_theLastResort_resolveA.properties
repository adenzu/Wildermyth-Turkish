.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> resolved the issue.
.longName=The Last Resort
.name=Result
~01~~panel_001~1_narration=After the fighting's done, the grateful <npc> throws a small feast to thank them. The woodland seer, it seems, never foresaw this possibility, this random raving monster that would've devastated all <npc.mf:he/she/they>'d built.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=<npc.mf:He/She/They> and <hook> talk late into the night...
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=...sharing old dreams, wisdoms, and what-ifs.
~01~~panel_004~1_hook2=The old <npc.mf:man/woman/person> sees them off in the morning.
~01~~panel_005~1_hook2=There's a new parcel among <hook>'s things.
~01~~panel_005~3_hook=Hm? Oh, a keepsake. Something <npc.mf:he/she/they> used to wear. Anyone could use it.
~01~~panel_006~1_hook2=What'd <npc.mf:he/she/they> give you?
~01~~panel_007~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:happy]/>
~01~~panel_007~3_hook=Myself, I already received a great gift from <npc>. Just knowing there was someone who understood. And knowing these dreams have a purpose. That it's about challenging fate, not accepting it.
~01~~panel_008~3_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:happy]/>
~01~~panel_008~4_hook2=That's a lot of things you got.
~01~~panel_008~5_hook=<npc.mf:He's/She's/They're> a generous <npc.mf:man/woman/person>.
~01~~panel_009~1_hook=We'll be in town by night, I think.
~01~~panel_009~2_narration=Some days later...
~01~~panel_011~1_hook2=Hey, <hook>...
~01~~panel_012~1_hook=You going to ask whether I'll think about it? The [i]what if[]? Staying with <npc>, and seeing if I could do what <npc.mf:he does/she does/they do>?
~01~~panel_013~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Not that I really care, one way or the other. It's only...[face:skeptical]/[face:happy]Yeah./[face:skeptical]Yeah./--->
~01~~panel_014~1_hook=Will I regret it? <hook.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:The chance to learn, I suppose. But/Seems like a safer career, I'll say that. But/Seemed like a comfortable living, didn't it? But/I'll wonder, I imagine, if I couldn't have saved more lives, <npc.mf:his/her/their> way. But/The solitude. I could live that way. But/I think of a gardener. <hook.mf:he chooses/she chooses/they choose> to plant, and I'm sure at times feels envious of other yields. But the seeds <hook.mf:he's/she's/they've> sown are wondrous magic themselves. Anyway,/I could see myself getting wistful, of course. Imagining that life. But/No, not really. That looked stressful, did you see <npc.mf:his/her/their> wrinkles? Anyway,/I could've done it. But> <hook.rfln.hook2: someone's got to watch you. Keep you honest, right?/I've got good friends. I need to stand beside them./I've already got you to fill my heart with./--->
~01~~panel_015~1_hook=Last resort, though... I could always go back.<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:joke]/[face:happy]/[face:happy]/--->
~01~~panel_015~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]/[face:interested]/[face:happy]/--->
