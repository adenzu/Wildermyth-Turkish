~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=They're restless, after that. Wary of letting the fire reach beyond its coals. [ni]Too[] wary to let it go out.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_hook2=<hook2.hothead.60:Idiot wildthings./Poor weird beast. What's it even want? Heat? Light?>
~01~prompt~panel_002~4_narration=The next day comes as fog.
~01~prompt~panel_002~5_narration=Small rippling hills surround them.
~01~prompt~panel_002~6_hook=Feel like flies on a lake.
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_hook2=Got cold, didn't it?
~01~prompt~panel_004~5_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]It sometimes does./<hook.bookish.60:Comparatively. This region does see some dramatic weather./[face:interested]We're close. This earthcolor's familiar to me.>/[face:happy]Feel free to come share a cloak./==>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=The road they're on is narrow, dust all fine and gray.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=As <hook> rounds the next bend, \na close knot of trees...
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=...the light spreads over <hook.mf:him/her/them>, warm and full.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook=Look up, <hook.rfln.hook2:you crust-head./now. We're here./<hook2>.../==>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hook2=This's... this's...
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_narration=They move slow. Like rainwater, are absorbed into the sun-threaded slopes of Lucaria Valley.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_darken=Spend the while together, in shared reflection and idleness.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:happy]/[face:joy]/==>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_darken=Spend it apart, meditating privately and mending old dreams.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_narration=Time glides by, counted in clouds passing...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_narration=...in shifting vigils of birds...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_narration=...in mellow chirps of crickets.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:interested]Eh. No one seems too bad, in a hot spring./Yeah. Pass me a soap./[face:happy]Mhmm. Slip in here with me./==>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook.personality:[face:neutral]Sages filled libraries with the ideas spawned in this place. Is that the kind of comment that annoys you?/[face:interested]It was nice before... but I'm glad I brought company. Even you. Is that odd to say?/[face:happy]Funny how you forget being annoyed at each other, when the world's not demanding you support each other./[face:neutral]I'd build my house up on that ridge. And you know? I'd even let you visit. I'd welcome you. Is that surprising?/[face:sad]Why're we rivals? Don't you sometimes wonder? Am I just feeling the peace of this place?/Suddenly feel like the <hook.mf:King/Queen/Paragon> of Quietude. Isn't that weird?/[face:neutral]I know we don't always get along. This place makes me feel how silly that is./[face:neutral]If my price for living here was having to live with [i]you[]... you know, I think I'd take it./[face:grim]The best nights are a lens through which we see the grace in things, even those things we disdain by daylight./[face:joy]Have to turn away. Looking at you now, <hook2.mf:<hook.awm:you seem like a sympathetic character./you almost look [i]handsome[].>/<hook.awm:you almost look [i]pretty[]./you seem like a sympathetic character.>/you almost look [i]pretty[].>/How small and insignificant we are. Silly to fight over anything.>/<hook.personality:Several sages wrote their best work, isolated here. You can understand it./There's other places like this. Right? Out there?/[face:happy]Remember swamps? Why does anyone go in swamps anymore?/[face:talking]I'd build it up on that hill, there. My house. This'd all be my daily haunt./[face:neutral]Think [i]everyone[] should come here. They'd leave in less of a hurry to go bleed and spill blood./[face:talking]Just like last time. So peace-filled, inside. It's weird. It's [i]nice[]./[face:neutral]Distance from it all... makes all the conflict feel... almost unimportant./How could you wish to spend your life among people? In our drab old towns?/[face:talking]Our wounded bodies, wounded hearts. Don't let it be said the earth doesn't care for us./[face:interested]No journey here is wasted. But if you brought your lover, I'm not sure you'd ever want to leave./[face:neutral]Nothing ever 'took my breath away.' Know that old line? This always comes close.>/<hook.personality:[face:interested]Sages wrote their best work here. I'd study only your form in moonlight, if I could./[face:interested]You think we could live somewhere like this? Safely? Be happy?/[face:joke]How glad are you to be here with me, right now? Am I not a <hook.mf:King/Queen/Sage> worth serving?/[face:talking]I'd build it up on that hill, there. Our house. All this'd be ours. Sound nice?/[face:neutral]Place helps me clear my soul. Are you happy, love?/[face:talking]Same as before, but better. You're here. Doesn't it fill you with quiet? With peace? It's strange.../[face:neutral]Sometimes this is [i]all[] I want. Forget everything. We could live happy here./[face:neutral]Let's not go back. We'll love. We'll live only here./[face:talking]Flower of creation, fire of my heart... tranquil moonbeams. I love this. I love you./[face:interested]This's the world I would take you to. Forever, if I could./[face:neutral]Seems like a different world, here, doesn't it? Almost too good for us.>/==>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_narration=They manage a calm week in Lucaria Valley. They're untroubled.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_hook2=And tomorrow we're leaving?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~2_hook=Unless we don't.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_009~1_narration=The road going home is tougher than it was coming abroad.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_010~4_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2.healer/loner/snark/60:[face:happy]No, you know what? Thanks for showing it to me. All our differences aside./[face:neutral]Surprisingly, no. Think I'll go back alone./[face:skeptical]Pretty much./[face:skeptical]It was great. But, uh... let's bring different people, next time.>/<hook2.goofball/loner/poet/snark/60:[face:joy]Wouldn't be as beautiful [i]without[] the aches and pains./[face:interested]I'd say so. Getting away, being in a place so removed... it's hard to beat./[face:happy]I'm sure the answer lives in my eyes./[face:skeptical]Big lovely greenplace? Eh. Not [i]really[]. Could've gone somewhere closer./I'd go again in a year. If there was peace. Makes me wish the whole world could be that way.>/<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/loner/romantic/snark/80:[face:happy]Star-writer and thinker, <npc.fullname>, said of love: "There's only one force I know of, can defy the celestial pull."/[face:happy]If we get separated, or sent away... let's meet there. Let's live there. Would you?/[face:joy]Foolish prancer, I [i]am[] your destiny! And you've danced right into my eternal coils!/[face:neutral]Mm, right. You know how I feel. Leaving the world behind to live with you... I'd be happy with that./[face:joke]Oh. Why? You have some standing betrothal to a Dusk <hook.awm:Princess/Prince>? Is this romance of ours merely a twisting, illicit passion?/[face:dubious]Wait, so [i]I'm not[] your destiny? \nYou have other plans, suddenly?/[face:happy]We'll be alright, you know? Someday, maybe we'll build our home there. That's the destiny [i]I[] see.>/==>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_010~5_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Was it wasted on you?/Worth the aches and pains?/Glad we saw it together. Feels like dodging destiny, to be with you./==>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_011~1_narration=The trip trickles to its end.

~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_narration=...in shifting vigils of birds...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_narration=...in mellow chirps of crickets.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_hook=<hook.personality:Phases of you... tricked me into thinking you changed./I'll never stop wanting to look up at you, Moon. Is that.../Silence does strange things to people. Huh, Moon?/What's anything I own, compared to a place like this?/Sometimes, I'd love to just cut the caring out of my heart./Why's it all happening? The blood. Pain. It's constant./The swords and spears won't ever touch you. Talons. Jaws./See how they distance themselves from you? Picking constellations.../The moon is a kite./Who else is gazing up at you, moon?/What's taking me so long?>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006~2_hook=<hook.personality:Then I learned. You were always more than I conceived./Is that why I'm so afraid of dying?/When will you say [i]your[] secrets?/A life of peace. What's the price for [i]that[]?/Is it time to stop, Old Moon?/I lose myself in the tide./Wish I could... wish I.../I'm your <hook.mf:brother/sister/cousin>, Moon. \nAren't I?/My heart is one, too./Who, under this moon, is falling in love?/I'm supposed to be more than this, someday. Aren't I?>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_007~2_hook=Mm. I guess so. Unless I decide to stay forever.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_007~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Hm? [i]What[] nonsense?/What was that?/Love?/==> Tomorrow's \nstill the plan, right?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_008~2_hook=How was the waterfall?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_008~4_hook2=Yeah.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_009~2_hook=What?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_009~4_hook2=Sorry. Good. It was all good.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_010~1_narration=The road going home is tougher than it was coming abroad.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_011~5_hook=So that's Lucaria Valley. <hook.personality:Solitude in these wild cathedrals... It's how we learn about ourselves. Studying at the knees of the cosmos. /There's nothing better than the moonlight there. The way it seems endless. Life... starts to seem like it can't end./I can stand it, for a while. But that smug old moon, up there, unwinking... Someday, I'll make <hook.awm:her/him> break. Laugh, blink, or blush./When I'm there, I almost don't need [i]anything[] else. It's the most free feeling in the world./If I was going to throw everything else away, live just for myself... you'd find me there./When I'm there, I'm different. More at peace. [i]Rooted[]./I wish I could dodge destiny. Excuse myself from... everything. If I could, that's where you'd find me./In a weird way... that's the closest I can get. To my family. To my true home./I guess, to me, the way to live truest is to hang my heart on the wind. Let it be blown where the world's temper takes it./All the love in the world could originate in that place. Find its way into our hearts, through moonbeams, firesmoke. Stories, ideas. I don't know./[face:joy]I'd ask to be buried there, but I don't want the land to get corrupted. Or depressed. Or sarcastic.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_012~4_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Wouldn't have guessed. But it was good. <volunteer.exists:<volunteer>'d like it there./Place I'd take my <hook2.mf:son/daughter/kid>, if I ever had one.>/<volunteer.exists:You know who'd love it? My <volunteer.mf:son/daughter/kid>./If I had a kid, I'd take <hook2.mf:him/her/them> there.>/That place... When the fighting's all done... <volunteer.exists:Think our <volunteer.mf:son/daughter/kid>'d love to see it, too./And if we ever have children...>/==>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_013~1_narration=The trip trickles to its end.

~06~player_chose_two~panel_013~6_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:neutral]/[face:interested]/[face:happy]/==>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_013~7_hook=Hm. Yeah.
