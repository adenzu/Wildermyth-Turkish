.name=Opportunity
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=<hook2> never told anyone.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=In fact, <hook2.mf:he/she/they> often wondered whether it had truly happened at all.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=A deathcurse had been laid on <hook2.mf:his head as a boy/her head as a girl/their head as a child>...
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=...the words of some weird <legend.mf:warlock/witch/warlock> whose wrath had been stirred.
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_narration=A vulture voice shrieked in <hook2>'s sleep, visiting often\non nights of a shadowed moon.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=Many years went by.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_narration=As <season>s piled up, <hook2> began to feel a clutching hand at <hook2.mf:his/her/their> heart.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_narration=And at last <hook2.mf:he/she/they> confided in someone.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2.mf:He/She/They> chose the person <hook2.mf:he/she/they> thought least likely to care. This person would make the soundest decisions, <hook2.mf:he/she/they> supposed./<hook2.mf:He/She/They> chose a friend, a <hook.mf:man/woman/person> with whom <hook2.mf:he/she/they>'d fought battles, and beaten dire odds./<hook2.mf:He/She/They> chose the person <hook2.mf:he/she/they> cared for most of all./-->
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_hook=Cottage is just up this way. <hook.coward/goofball/healer/60:[face:interested]It's a little... [i]spookier[] than I'd hoped.../[face:happy]Had to be in the spookiest place possible, I guess./How're you doing? How's your breathing?[face:interested]/<hook.rfln.hook2:Not going to fall over are you?/Don't hesitate to say anything. If you're worn down./Love? Let me know if you need to rest./-->>
~01~prompt~panel_006~5_hook2=[small]<hook.coward/goofball/healer/60:[face:skeptical]Cottage in the woods. Kind of has to be./[face:skeptical]Does seem to be how these things go./[face:grim]I'm fine, I said. It's not like it's wasting me away. Quite yet./<hook.rfln.hook2:Me? Not in front of [i]you.[] It's not that kind of thing./[face:grim]Mm. I don't think it's... hitting me that way... yet./[face:grim]Mm. I don't think it's... hitting me that way... yet./-->>
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_narration=They travel to the whispered home of an exile.
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_narration=An old mystic, reputed to have studied curses and their counters.
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_hook2=I do wonder...
~01~prompt~panel_008~4_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious][small]Of course you do./[face:grim]Hm?/[face:interested]Hm?/>
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_hook2=<hook2.bookish/loner/poet/romantic/60:I wonder what it implies. An [i]exile.[] Who tinkers in curses.../[face:grim]I don't know. [i]Exile. Being exiled.[] I'm not someone who hangs in every window for a word. But that idea... what did this person [i]do?[]/I wonder about the word [i]exile.[] \nExiled from [i]where,[] and for [i]what?[]/In stories, the exile... they'll seem kindly. They'll seem like someone who was [i]wronged.[] Only to show their true colors at the critical moment./Well, there's a reason exiles got [i]exiled[], right?>
~01~prompt~panel_009~4_hook=<hook.bookish/greedy/hothead/leader/loner/poet/60:[face:neutral]/[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]/[face:neutral]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]/>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hook=<hook2.bookish/loner/poet/romantic/60:I see what you're saying. [i]Why[] were they exiled, right? And should that matter? I think.../I can't really say, myself. I don't know./There's answers to those questions, I'm sure. I'm not sure they're knowable./This isn't a wintertale, <hook2>. Yeah, this person was once [i]exiled.[] And what does that really mean?/There's [i]some[] reason.> <hook.bookish/hothead/loner/60:[face:interested]See, I think... we ostracize people, sometimes just because they [i]see[] things differently. And today, tonight... I feel like we could use that. An uncommon perspective./Other folks got [i]scared[] of them. Probably because they're capable of something the others aren't.[face:skeptical]/Exiles are often just people who made too much sense, too publicly./[face:skeptical]I mean, we ourselves aren't exactly welcome everywhere. Sometimes it's just... [i]difference[]... that people fear.>
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_hook2=What's <legend.mf:the guy/this lady/this person> called?[face:skeptical]
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_hook=[small]Uh. [i]<legend>.[] Was the name I heard. <legend.fullname>.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_legend=[i]Trees?[] Is it the wakeful [i]trees[] again, \nall mumbling and moth-peppered?
~01~prompt~panel_012~3_narration=From the far side of the cottage, <legend.mf:his/her/their> creaky voice bleats...
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_legend=Is it trees or the breeze between them? Or the hare or the proud owl? Muttering to mock my ears, on this most markless night?
~01~prompt~panel_015~3_hook=<hook.coward/goofball/healer/60:[face:interested]I promise, we're none of those things./You're full of rare words, aren't you?[face:happy]/[face:happy]Easy now. We're just some well-meaning strangers, here to talk./It's none of those things. It's just [i]us.[][face:talking]>
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_legend=Whatever you be! Lostlings, or doggens, or even a man-o-bones! If you creep hankering to my cottage door, be warned! I'm no morsel for a tooth, nor treasure for a--
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_legend=<hook.coward/goofball/healer/60:Do you promise? By what token, spirit-voice, am I to... trust a.../I've dug quite deep for them! And who are [i]you,[] complementary spirit-voice?/Well-[i]meaning?[] Which are those?/Which ones are [i]us[]?>
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_narration=Then <legend.mf:his/her/the hermit's> lanternlight finds their faces...
~01~prompt~panel_018~3_legend=Oh!
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_narration=...and a laugh spills <legend.mf:from him/from her/out>. A burbly, wet, warm laugh.
~01~prompt~panel_019~3_legend=<hook.theme_skeleton:<hook.mf:Man-o-bones! And his nightly companion!/Woman-o-bones! And her nightly companion!/A real folk-o-bones! And their nightly ally!>/<hook2.theme_skeleton:<hook2.mf:Man-o-bones! And his nightly companion!/Woman-o-bones! And her nightly companion!/A real folk-o-bones! And their nightly ally!>/Oh-ho, is it two couth travelers!?>> Ahoo, ahoo. Come inside! It's late, but my stove's going! There's pigfeet pickled nine years! Chicken I'll chap and simmer!
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_narration=They tell this exiled mystic about <hook2>'s curse as chicken cooks in a bluish bath.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_legend=Curses, hexes, are really extensions of nature. Agents of a \nwild will. Like beasts, like fire. Eating. Breathing. Destroying.
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_legend=[light]Once a curse is spun into motion, it follows the course of chaos. The trick then is to trap it. To lure it out of the life it circles, and bind it within new bounds.
~01~prompt~panel_023~2_legend=Sure, I know how to do this. But the cost is always steep.
~01~prompt~panel_024~2_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:skeptical]We're low on alternatives, so... I think we'll do what you propose?/We don't... or I'm not fully sure... but I don't think we have a lot of options.[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]Well, name a price. I bet we can work something out./[face:grim]We can pay it. If anyone can./[face:grim]That's unsurprising. What'll it take?/[face:skeptical]We're low on options. What kind of price are we talking?/[face:grim]We can handle most things. What do you need?>
~01~prompt~panel_026~3_legend=If you are set on it, then there's somewhere you must go. And you may not well enjoy it, what you find there, but you are to retrieve something. A stone.
~01~prompt~panel_027~2_legend=A stone that was buried. \nIn a cave well hidden.
~01~prompt~panel_028~3_legend=There are few objects of power in this world fit to be a home... a [i]prison[]... for a curse. \nThe Dwemerald stone, green and bright. Hope that I am the only one who knows its location.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~2_narration=They leave on a quest of cursebreaking\nas dawn crests the hilltops.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook2=Something about the way <legend.mf:he/she/they>... \nit feels [i]off[]. I'll find another answer.
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
