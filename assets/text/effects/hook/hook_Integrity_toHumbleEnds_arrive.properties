~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=<hook> leads <hook2> onto the ancestral lands of the Oldwane family.
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_narration=The Oldwane legend is a rich well of villains for <town> storytellers, a group of questionably related kinsfolk living in a secluded manor, practicing dark crafts...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook2=<hook2.greedy/loner/snark/60:A swamp. Weren't these people rich?/It's isolated. Say that for it./Predictably swampy./It had to be in a swamp, didn't it? No wonder these people were so... morbid.>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook=Come on. <hook.rfln.hook2:<hook.hothead/loner/60:Or are you too precious to get a little bogwater in your boots?/Place makes me nervous enough without having you at my back./Unless you're too spooked. I get it.>/<hook.bookish.60:Nothing intrinsically evil about a wetland. Aside from the smell./Better if we stick close.>/<hook.leader/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:happy]It wouldn't take courage if it wasn't a little scary, right, love?/[face:happy]Just pretend we're two handsome toads. We [i]love[] this./[face:happy]When we kiss about this later, you'll thank me for goading you through./Or do you not like me when I'm covered in mud?/I see the buildings up ahead. It's not romantic, but...>/--->

~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:///--->
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook=<hook.bookish/greedy/loner:This looks like it was a guardhouse, maybe. Look at the thickness of the stones./I bet they built out here because they were paranoid. Hoarding wealth. Look how thick the walls are./It's not so bad when you've got thick enough stones. Only bad for visitors, which is probably what they intended.../>
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_hook2=<hook.bookish/greedy/loner:<hook2.coward/goofball/healer/60:Stone-thickness noted./Do I have to?/Must be close./[face:grim]<hook>. Just...>/<hook2.bookish/greedy/loner/60:That's a sound theory.../How [i]much[] wealth?/[face:interested]Yeah. And if you had all you needed.../>/<hook2.coward/hothead/loner/60:It [i]would[] be pretty secure.../[face:angry]You're still in the swamp, though./You're winning me over./>/>
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_narration=Soon they're within a proper ruin, with towers half sunk and many of them tumbled.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook2=We're looking for a forge?
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hook=There's a stairwell.
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_hook2=And there you go...
~01~prompt~panel_010~4_hook2=You're sure this is right? This is how you unmake the thing?
~01~prompt~panel_010~5_hook=Here, take the torch.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_narration=As <hook> draws the dagger, the Oath of Oldwane, \nthe eyes over the forge begin to glow.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=The forge roars awake, vomiting hot coals.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_narration=But like the dagger itself, the glowing embers arrest <hook.mf:his/her/their> eyes.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_narration=And then <hook.mf:he sees/she sees/they see> two futures in the flames.
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_action=[dark]<hook>...
~01~prompt~panel_014~3_action=[darkGray]<hook>...
~01~prompt~panel_014~4_action=[gray]<hook>...
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_darken=In one, <hook.mf:he sees/she sees/they see> <hook.mf:himself/herself/themself> aged and alone, still fighting the same long losing battles <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> embroiled in today.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_darken=In the other, <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> not much older than <hook.mf:he is/she is/they are> now. <hook.mf:He's/She's/They've> used the power in the dagger to bring peace to those <hook.mf:he loves/she loves/they love>.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_narration=It would change <hook.mf:him/her/them>, but not immediately. \nIn the meantime, think of all the good <hook.mf:he/she/they> \ncould accomplish, for <hook.mf:his/her/their> friends and\nfor this world...
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_narration=Perhaps <hook.mf:he/she/they> [b]should[] wield it.
~01~prompt~panel_017~3_narration=<hook.personality:In fact, using it would be the only rational decision./The chance to save everyone... \n<hook.mf:Is he/Is she/Are they> throwing it away?/Anyway, it couldn't be [b]that[] evil, could it?/The selfish thing would be to melt away that chance./<hook.mf:He/She/They> wouldn't ask another to do it... but.../Nothing would dare stand in <hook.mf:his/her/their> way./Wouldn't that be the selfless thing to do?/It would doom <hook.mf:him/her/them> to isolation.\nBut wasn't <hook.mf:he/she/they> already isolated?//Wouldn't everything turn out alright in the end?\nIt always does, for heroes./And what's to stop <hook.mf:him/her/them> destroying it later, right?>
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_narration=Destroy the dagger.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_narration=Keep the dagger.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~1_narration=The dagger meets the forge and instantly melts. The coals jump and fly. Frigid air fills the room, snuffs the torch.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~1_narration=And then...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~2_narration=...an apparition takes shape.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~2_legend=[light]Is it truly done? You cast away that cursed blade of mine?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~3_hook=Yours?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~1_narration=The spirit resolves into the form of a <legend.mf:man/woman/person>.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~2_legend=[light]I made it in vengeance... to punish the world that persecuted my family. So rashly done...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~4_hook2=...you regret it, you mean?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~1_legend=[light]The anger was cold in me long before the blood stopped running. But I'd set it in motion. Someone else would need to end it.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_007~2_legend=[light]I can't answer for all the pain it's caused.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_008~2_legend=[light]But to you, at least...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~1_narration=The glow that surrounds the last Oldwane mystic flares brightly for a moment!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~1_narration=And <legend.mf:he's/she's/they're> gone.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~2_narration=Where <legend.mf:he/she/they> stood lies what looks to be a bolt of fabric. At a second glance, it's a cloak of ghostly weave...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_011~1_hook2=You sure you want to touch that?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_012~1_narration=<hook> bends and picks it up.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_013~3_hook=This feels... different.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_013~4_hook2=Just got through destroying an evil artifact, didn't we?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_014~4_action=[tan][actionLarge]Gwoooorgh!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_014~5_narration=A bestial bellow echoes down the stairwell.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_001~2_hook2=Uhhh... <hook>?
~06~player_chose_no~panel_002~3_hook=I was wrong. There [i]is[] a reason this dagger came to me.\nBut it wasn't to throw it in the fire...
~06~player_chose_no~panel_004~3_hook2=Well...
~06~player_chose_no~panel_005~1_narration=<hook>'s cry resounds down the stairs.
~06~player_chose_no~panel_005~4_hook=<hook2>!!
~06~player_chose_no~panel_007~3_narration=It seems [b]something[] doesn't wish them to leave...
~06~player_chose_no~panel_008~3_narration=With a flash and a noiseless snarl...
~06~player_chose_no~panel_009~1_hook=An Oldwane ghost! <legend.mf:He craves/She craves/They crave> the dagger!\nWe can't let <legend.mf:him/her/them> take it!
~06~player_chose_no~panel_010~3_narration=...the spirit transforms!
~06~player_chose_no~panel_010~4_action=[tan]GWOORGH!
