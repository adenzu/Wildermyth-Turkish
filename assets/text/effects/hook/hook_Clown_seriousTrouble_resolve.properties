~01~~panel_001~1_hook2=<legend>!
~01~~panel_002~1_hook=<hook.goofball/snark:<legend.mf:He's/She's/They're> right here!/[face:skeptical]This [i]is[] <legend.mf:him/her/them>, isn't it?>
~01~~panel_003~1_hook=<hook.goofball/snark:/[face:talking]>You okay? You seem to have been kidnapped by <foes.plural>.
~01~~panel_003~2_legend=Yes, I don't understand, they...
~01~~panel_004~1_hook=<hook.goofball/snark:Oh, it doesn't matter why!/[face:dubious]Oh, believe me, nobody else gets it either.>
~01~~panel_005~1_legend=<hook2>? Did my sister send for you?
~01~~panel_005~2_hook2=You're safe! You know I would've gotten an earful if you were dead!
~01~~panel_005~3_hook=<hook.goofball/snark:[face:happy]/>
~01~~panel_006~1_hook=<hook.goofball/snark:[face:happy]Not really./Eh.>
~01~~panel_007~1_hook2=That's right. She wrote that you'd been taken, and we feared the worst. Didn't we, <hook>?
~01~~panel_008~1_hook=But listen, this is all very boring, so... Should we go? This place stinks of <foes.cdgmt:mushrooms and mold and muckdwellers./Drauvdung and doom and death./oozing flesh and miscellanious gorgonous gases./gear-oil and rotting bones./spells and spiderfarts.>
~01~~panel_010~1_legend=I have to thank you, too. Your name is <hook>? You're so brave. <hook2> is lucky to have <hook.rfln.hook2:an ally/a friend/a friend--only friends, right?--/---> so able, someone <hook2.mf:he/she/they> can turn to in times of serious trouble.
~01~~panel_011~1_hook=After a short trip to <legend>'s hometown, where they feasted and danced, <hook.bookish/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/romantic:bedecked in garlands of sageleaf and bluebells/drowning in spirits and songs and wild fights/anoninted with laurels and medals and songs/and to some discomfort were called upon for speeches and poems/their praises sung and drunk to, deeds recounted in full/swept around the floor with country men and maidens in a passionate whirl>...
~01~~panel_011~2_hook2=...<hook> and <hook2> set out for home once more.
~01~~panel_012~1_hook=<hook.goofball/snark:And it turns out I'm not such a worthless <hook.mf:guy/girl/person> to have around. <hook.bookish.60:Nor am I too loud or jocund!/Nor am I exceedingly silly.>/[face:skeptical]Why didn't they give us medals, though? Isn't there supposed to be medals?>
~01~~panel_014~1_hook=<hook.goofball/snark:Actually I can be <hook.bookish.60:overly jocund/a little silly> at times./[face:grim]Maybe the townsfolk were working with the <foes.plural> all along...>
~01~~panel_014~2_hook2=<hook.goofball/snark:<hook.rfln.hook2:And I guess we should all learn to accept that./You? I wouldn't have said so.../And we can't help but love you for it./--->/Maybe we all are... in our own way...>
