~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.snark.75:So, remind me again, <hook2>, and for anyone else that might need to know the plot, what exactly are we doing?/You'll be glad you called on me, <hook2>. I'm what they call a firebrand. A <hook.mf:rampant stallion/mighty mare of war/rampant stallion>, a <hook.mf:lion/lioness/lion> with lightning in <hook.mf:his/her/their> eyes!>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook2=Here's something to try. Let's walk in silence for a while. Just for a little while. How about that?
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook.snark/goofball:How long did you want to do that, though? Are we done/Want me to show you my tooth-collection>?/Cool, so I did that. Now what should we do?/<hook.snark/goofball:Wait, sorry, were you being serious?/I'm bored of that.>/--->
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook=But I seriously forgot where we're going...
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Fine. One more time./Do you expect me to laugh right now, <hook>?/Alright, one more time. Commit it to memory./---> My cousin's in danger. <legend.mf:He's/She's/They've> been kidnapped by someone you claim to know. And so...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=Ah, ah, ah! Right! I recall it now.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hook2=Alright. <hook.rfln.hook2:So then you know why I'm not in a chatty mood./I know you're only trying to make things better. I'm sorry./Sorry for getting frustrated. I'm thankful you came along, truly./--->
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=Well, but there's one thing I... well.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook2=What?
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook=You said I claimed to know the kidnapper.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hook=I was kidding of course. That would be such a crazy coincidence!
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hook2=[b][actionLarge][blue]%@$#&!
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook=And so our journey to save <legend> began in guttural style...
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=And actually... Can't we say this all happened later? Another time? And possibly never?
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
