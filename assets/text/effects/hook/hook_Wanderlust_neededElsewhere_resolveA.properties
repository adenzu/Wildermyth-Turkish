~01~~panel_001~1_npc2=Farmers coming? Naw, no cart.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=A long week later, on a windless afternoon...
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=<npc2> the millkeeper squints as distant shadows resolve into shapes with familiar faces.
~01~~panel_003~1_npc2=Oh, them! They'd love if I broke out the beer, I expect.
~01~~panel_004~1_npc2=And why wouldn't I?
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=At the millkeeper's fire, <hook> and <hook2> drink a little.
~01~~panel_005~3_narration=Good having the sky off them. Good smelling dry building-stones, fresh flour.
~01~~panel_005~5_hook=Even sweeps the rafters...
~01~~panel_007~2_hook=What's wrinkling [i]you[]?
~01~~panel_008~2_hook2=Said you were leaving the company. For good. Guess that's still got me thinking.
~01~~panel_009~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Really didn't expect to be coming back./I was talking about starting fresh, \nwasn't I? Some other place?/Would you have gone with me? If... I mean, at this point it would be.../==>
~01~~panel_010~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]Yeah? I was going to ask, but I also didn't want to./[face:interested]Decided against it, though?/You're [i]not[] planning on going away now, are you?/==>
~01~~panel_011~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:neutral]You [i]went[]. Now you're coming back. Wasn't like you found anything worth staying for./[face:neutral]It's your old thing, I know. They call it roamingwant. Travel-longing. Or also.../[face:interested]I know, love. It's your traveling heart. \nAnd yes. I'd stay with you./==>
~01~~panel_011~2_hook=I was going [i]somewhere[], I thought. But really, I just wanted to go anywhere. Anywhere new. It's my...
~01~~panel_012~4_npc2=Got potatoes and market sausage frying up.
~01~~panel_013~5_hook2=It'll be nice.
~01~~panel_013~6_hook=Thanks.
~01~~panel_014~4_npc2=You know, reminds me of the people I grew up with. Pushing hard on whoever wouldn't push back. Why do you think I ended up out here? There's those sorts, all over.
~01~~panel_015~1_npc2=All you've told me, and all I can divine about you... You'll always be needed elsewhere. Good folks are needed everywhere.
~01~~panel_016~4_npc2=Yes, and answer that call if you can. When you can. Just don't underestimate the value of having a place to come home to.
~01~~panel_017~1_npc2=Oh, the...!
~01~~panel_017~2_action=POP!!
~01~~panel_017~3_narration=The food in the pan complains. \n<npc2> scoots back to <npc2.mf:his/her/their> kitchen.
~01~~panel_019~1_hook2=Was a good thing, you know? And we managed it the right way. For all <legend.mf:his/her/their> faults, taking that <legend.mf:man/woman/person>'s life... will weigh on me.
~01~~panel_020~1_narration=Even in the throes of battle, <hook> and <hook2> were able to subdue <legend>'s underlings. The bandit leader <legend.mf:himself/herself/themself>, however, fought to the end. They killed <legend.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~~panel_021~2_hook=Others'll be alright, you think?
~01~~panel_022~1_hook2=They'll recover. <hook2.personality:If they've got any capacity for absorbing a lesson, they'll find a different path./If they... I mean, I [i]hope[] they seek safer careers. But...[face:interested]/[face:happy]Think they'll be embarrassed? Should've let me tattoo them./[face:talking]They'll come after us, someday. Or I mean, best to expect that. Guard our things, our people./[face:talking]Kind of wish we'd lingered, and... well, tried to help them towards a better path./[face:grim]Got their lives to live. They don't really deserve much more than that./They took us on; I did all I could trying not to deal permanent damage. Our mercy was in the right measure, I'd say./[face:neutral]If they've got some pain for the rest of their lives... oh well./Told them to open a tavern. Place a bad past can ferment, become bitter wisdom./A few scars don't hurt. Shows you're a survivor. <hook2.awm:Women/Men> find that intriguing. Alluring, even.[face:happy]/[face:skeptical]But I mean, who's ever [i]alright[]? I'm not alright. I'm less and less alright.>
~01~~panel_022~2_hook=We left them in good hands. Only fear is that the commoners will want their [i]own[] revenge.
~01~~panel_023~2_narration=<hook> unrolls the poster that pulled <hook.mf:him/her/them> across the world.\nThough creased and stained, old ink still gleams in the firelight.
~01~~panel_024~1_hook=Let's split our takings with this mill<npc2.mf: man/ woman/keeper>. <npc2>. Sure <npc2.mf:he/she/they> could use some supplies. Feel like robbers ourselves, otherwise.
~01~~panel_024~2_narration=<hook.mf:He wads/She wads/They wad> the paper into a ball...
~01~~panel_024~3_action=[actionSmall]...crmple...
~01~~panel_025~2_action=[actionSmall][brown]fwsh
~01~~panel_025~3_narration=...and <hook.mf:flicks/flicks/flick> it into the flames.
