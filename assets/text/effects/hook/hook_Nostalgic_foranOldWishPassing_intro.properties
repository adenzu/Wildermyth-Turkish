.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> go to pay their respects...
.longName=For an Old Wish Passing
.name=Opportunity
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=<hook> and <hook2> are called to a hill village, where an acquaintance of theirs has lost <npc.mf:his/her/their> <npc2.mf:husband/wife/partner>.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_hook2=<hook2.bookish/loner/romantic/60:After this rain comes, the farms will prosper again./Hope the rites are short. Looks like rain's on the way./It's the right kind of sky for a funeral./[face:interested]It's a hard thing. Death.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_hook=<hook2.bookish/loner/romantic/60:<hook.rfln.hook2:Is that the comfort you plan to give old <npc>?\n/Not if there's no farmers left./...Is that really what's on your mind right now?/-->/<hook.loner.60:Hm. Funeral weather./<hook.rfln.hook2:You're worse than heartless. \nYou're proud of it, aren't you?/Show some feeling, <hook2>./<hook2>, please. You sound heartless./-->>/<hook.rfln.hook2:You spend too much time with stories.[face:dubious]/I'm not certain there is a right sky./Yeah, I guess it kind of is.\nA depressing, awful sky./-->/<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]Very astute, <hook2>. [i]Very[] astute./We forget how quickly things can turn...\n/Yeah... yeah./-->>
~01~prompt~panel_002~4_hook2=<hook2.bookish/loner/romantic/60:It's been a dry <season>.\nThat's all I mean.///>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=The funerary rites are brief. The crowd that's gathered is impressive for such a small town.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_narration=As mourners disperse, <hook> and <hook2> spot <npc> standing by a flower-strung cart bearing a leaf-shrouded body.
~01~prompt~panel_005~5_hook=<npc>. We were sorry to hear about <npc2>.
~01~prompt~panel_005~6_hook2=A lot of folks came.
~01~prompt~panel_006~5_npc=Ah... friends. How many years has it been?
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_narration=They go with <npc.mf:him/her/them>, up the road to <npc.mf:his/her/their> home on the hill.
~01~prompt~panel_007~5_npc=You lose perspective sometimes. Easy enough to do, sadly. You think you'll have years together. Decades. From your first cake, to your middle years. Old age, then... and... but.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_narration=The two help <npc> transfer the shrouded body to a small, prepared clay room beside the house.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_narration=They settle inside and <npc.mf:he tells/she tells/they tell> them of <npc.mf:his/her/their> plan, and of the provincial custom <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> observing...
~01~prompt~panel_009~6_npc=Greenveiling, it's called. A woven shroud of dawnsward. Dawnsward grows thick around here, in the little woodlands, you'll see. It's a strong aroma. \nThe body stays fresh. Sometimes as long as four years, or five.
~01~prompt~panel_010~5_npc=We hillfolk will generally build a clay home for the departed, on the house's shady side. A [i]wadshan[], \nis the old word for it. It means "Memory House."
~01~prompt~panel_011~6_npc=And <npc2.mf:he/she/they>'d normally lie there for <npc2.mf:his/her/their> term. When the shroud of dawnsward turns black, <npc2.mf:he/she/they>'d be buried.
~01~prompt~panel_011~7_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/healer/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested]I'm familiar with the tradition. I'll admit, I wasn't positive I'd ever see it carried out./[face:skeptical]Sounds like the ideal neighbor.../[face:sad]I wonder about it... keeping the dead so close. Whether it's good for you./There's something... very silencing in that. I think it's a good tradition./I've got a lot of respect for the old ways. They're rooted in deep truths./[face:interested]It's... achingly sad, isn't it? A beautiful tradition./[face:dubious]Sounds like the ideal neighbor.../Can't say I'm familiar with the practice. But... alright. Interesting.>
~01~prompt~panel_012~6_npc=But I don't plan on waiting.
~01~prompt~panel_013~6_npc=No. My <npc2.mf:husband/wife/partner> <npc2> and I will be going on a journey. And I hoped you'd come along.
~01~prompt~panel_014~8_hook2=You don't plan to wait? So you plan to bury <npc2.mf:him/her/them> soon? Tonight, even?
~01~prompt~panel_015~6_action=Crack!
~01~prompt~panel_016~6_npc=Oh!
~01~prompt~panel_016~8_action=[dark]THRUMM....
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_narration=A hard sudden rain falls, chittering and droning like a swarm.
~01~prompt~panel_018~6_npc=Yes, I hoped you'd come. Be our escort. It's a dangerous world, and you're both strong. Stronger even than I remembered.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook2=Well, <hook.rfln.hook2:<hook> might say no, but I'll go with you.../we're here, now. I'll come along with you, if you need protection./we're here to help. You're in favor, right, <hook>?/--->
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:I'm in, too./Me, too./Yep. Right./--->
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=I think we have some other things to take care of. Will we have time to come back...?
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
