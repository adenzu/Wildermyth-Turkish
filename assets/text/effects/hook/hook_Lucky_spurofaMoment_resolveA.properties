~01~~panel_001~2_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/romantic/60: Some association, perhaps? Between this castle and them?/[face:happy]Mm, bone-in ham. [i]That's[] what I'm craving./My lid-flipping fingers are [i]aching[].../Sometimes I wish we could talk to them... or [i]can[] we?/[face:joke]Tell him that's what happens when you <hook.weaponType:try to meet my blade./step in front of my axe./match blows with me./test my spear./charge my arrow./step in my path./let me draw my knife./cross my path./provoke me./get me riled up.>/[face:grim]No respect for the old places. No beauty in them at all./No unguarded chests. Typical, I suppose.>
~01~~panel_001~3_hook2=<hook2.bookish/poet/60:You wonder what motivates them. Or if anything does. What directive did they get, long ago, and from whom?/I hate seeing that light behind their eyes. Gives me the weird notion there's... something there./This guy's done.>
~01~~panel_002~1_hook=Oh, well. Time to see who [i]really[] won the bet!
~01~~panel_003~1_hook2=Must we?
~01~~panel_004~2_action=[gold]flip[]
~02~~panel_001~3_narration=A short while later...
~02~~panel_002~2_hook=Don't get what<hook.rfln.hook2:, <hook2.mf:Manberg/Womangrog/Personling>?/?/?/>
~02~~panel_003~1_hook2=I don't really get it.
~02~~panel_004~1_hook2=<hook2.personality:Is there some rational explanation...?/It freaks me out a little.../[face:skeptical]I mean really! How ludicrous!/[face:interested]I guess I should take you gambling more often./[face:neutral]I don't know how to say it./[face:angry]I'm [i]never[] that lucky.../[face:interested]No, it's a good thing. I'm just.../[face:grim]Hmph./[face:interested]Why? I don't understand [i]why[]?/[face:talking]It's just part of what makes you interesting./How can one person be just... [i]luckier[] than another?>
~02~~panel_006~2_hook=Since I don't know when... <hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]little things just tend to work out. For me. Often enough that... yeah. I sort of expect it. I realize it's obnoxious. /[face:talking]maybe all my life? Things tend to break my way. Not always, but I've recognized it's... abnormal? Little stuff, usually./[face:happy]well before we met, certainly. I've had tremendous fortune. Maybe it's the [i]reason[] we met at all./>
~02~~panel_007~2_hook=It's those small, spur of a moment kind of coincidences...
~02~~panel_007~3_hook2=That just slide perfectly into place?
~02~~panel_008~3_hook2=Right. <hook.rfln.hook2:Well, the bet wasn't serious, was it? \nI know [i]I[] wouldn't have held you to it./Well I owe you a pair of socks, I suppose./[face:happy]Well... I still owe you a favor, don't I?/>
~02~~panel_008~4_hook=Right.
~02~~panel_009~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:sad]//[face:joy]/>
~02~~panel_009~4_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]We can discuss it later, <hook2.mf:Manberg/Womangrog/Personling>. I need a bath./And they better be [i]new[] this time./[face:happy]And I'll let you know when I'm feeling [i]lucky[]./>
