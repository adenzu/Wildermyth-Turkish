~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_004~2_narration=Silence spills on every head, wavery and clinging as the light of these candles.
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_006~4_legend=But... and you'd really let us walk out of here?
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_006~7_hook=Sure. Disarmed.
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_007~3_npc=Uh, boss, we... It's not that we're disloyal, or...
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_007~5_npc3=Yeah, we just...
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_008~1_legend=It's fine. Do as they say.
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_008~2_narration=<legend> lays <legend.mf:his/her/their> weapons down carefully, watchfully.
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_009~6_legend=I don't know how you intend to stop us from coming back. Everything I see about you says you're not sticking around. But I suppose that's not for today. Today, you'll pat yourselves on the back. And why not? You did such good heroing.
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_010~1_legend=Sure. Flaunt your virtues all you want. Truth? You just got born the right place.
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_011~1_hook2=We [i]will[] return here. We [i]won't[] resort to words, then. And unlike you, what we say can be taken for truth.
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_012~3_hook2=Hm.
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_012~4_narration=<hook> and <hook2> watch the outlaws file from the room.
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_013~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]Hey, uh. Thanks. For having my back./[face:interested]That sort of went better than I expected./[face:interested]Thanks for riding that out with me. Gave me strength. Conviction./==> Let's collect these weapons. Give them to the locals, maybe? Or...
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_014~1_npc4=<npc4.goofball/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:[face:talking]So where we headed?/[face:talking]Take me with you./[face:grim]A moment, please./[face:neutral]I'm <npc4>./Hey. Uh, hey strongfolk.../Sorry. Um, excuse me.>
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_015~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Didn't have to squint very hard to see a rat./<hook>, what [i]will[] we do? To make sure of... I mean, [i]is[] there any way to...?/You know, I'd be extremely happy if you never tried anything like that again./===>
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_017~1_npc4=I'm <npc4.fullname>. Uh, so... <npc4.personality:[face:talking]From what I've comprehended thus far, you two are [i]actual[] heroes. Right? Your gear, your bearing, the way you came in here and dismantled <legend>'s whole thing? I'm [i]aching[] to learn from you./[face:skeptical]Umm. Here's what I want to say, I guess. I, uh, followed along with them because, well... my <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling> joined and I kind of just did whatever <npc3.mf:he/she/they> did./[face:joke]Yeah, hi. Didn't expect the statuesque young warrior in the back to come asking, did you? But here I am!/[face:sad]I'll be straight with you... I did my share of bad things, here. I even knew it was wrong. Felt like... we had to find a way to survive, and this was one./Apologies for if I'm unwelcome, or... Okay, it's just, I've only been here a short time. And I've already seen some things I can't unsee, and I... I'm failing at this, aren't I?/[face:grim]Kill me now if you think I'm false: my <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling>, <npc3>, and I, we joined believing that <legend.mf:man/woman/creep>'s lies. The fact we weren't the ones to speak up first is going to be a nail in my chest forever./[face:grim]I've never been proud of the work we did, here. My <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling>, <npc3>, and I, we joined believing the lies of that <legend.mf:man/woman/monster>. And we should've left earlier, and that's on us./[face:skeptical]Hey, my <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling>'s been wanting to leave, a while now. Be a wood<npc3.mf:sman/swoman/walker>, or I don't know. But I.../[face:sad]Perhaps you see me as the termite, asking you to let me into your house. I get that. And I understand if the things I've done, and my associations, leave such a stain on me that you can't believe my words./[face:grim]I... listen, I've done some things since I got here. I don't want to pretend I haven't. Stuff I'm not proud of./[face:skeptical]Yeah, so listen. I'm not about to pretend I'm blameless. I've done enough to earn my place here. But you guys look like... hm. What'm I trying to say?>
~05~player_chose_no.test_pass~panel_018~1_npc4=<npc4.personality:[face:interested]I've got book-knowledge, I can tangle with weapons, and, or I'm decent with manual labor if you need that. So... Can I follow you?/[face:interested]But... I want to be like [i]you[], not them. Not <npc3.mf:him, my brother,/her, my sister,/<npc3>> either... I'd just... love to have the courage. And. Please help me find it?/[face:interested]I can fight. I make pancakes better than... like. [i]Some[] people, at least. And so... do I qualify? To join you? Don't leave me stuck here, I'm [i]useful[]!/[face:interested]But I want a better way. I'm not [i]just[] trying to live. I'm trying to live well. Have the kind of wealth, glory, comfort... that lasts, you know? A hero life. A good life. Can I get that... with you?/[face:grim]The thing is, I want to change. Build a life the [i]right[] way. Make amends. Make [i]better[] than amends. So, do you... take on apprentices?/[face:joy]But I'm going to make it up! To the world, to the people! Let me join you, I'll [i]do[] my part. Times two!/[face:talking]But now... me, I want to be something greater. A hero like you? Maybe. I just want to contribute. So I'm asking, would you take me on, and show me how?/Anyway, I want to get away from here, too. My skills are just kind of specific though. But, so could [i]you[] use a.... One of me? Whatever I am? I'm someone who's mostly quiet. With an axe.[face:talking]/[face:talking]But if there's any truth in me, it's this: I [i]want[] to be better. Please. Bring me with you. Teach me./[face:happy]But I want to be better. I do. There's so much I want to [i]say[] I fight for. For love. For the future. For people all over this world. I [i]could[]. If you'd have me, I [i]could[] be a hero like you./Well, yeah, I just mean, if there's a way to earn a living like this, I mean with my axe, and without being evil... I think [i]anyone[][face:interested] would prefer the good route. Can I join you?>
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.coward/greedy/hothead/loner/poet/60:[face:interested]I get it. You're afraid to stop. You think you can't stop.../I've been hard up, before.

But every dream ends./A crab may be tyrant of <legend.mf:his/her/their> tidepool. Until the otter comes along./You're a reasonable <legend.mf:man/woman/person>.

~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_004~2_narration=Silence is all that follows. Stubborn, still, and dangerous.
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_005~1_legend=You're not dealing with children, here, little <hook.whm:pig-fighter./trail-pup./grass-charmer.> Our weapons are blooded, and there's more of us than there are of you.
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_006~6_legend=So thanks for your hero lesson. It was adorable. But we're not really interested.
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_007~1_npc4=Well [i]I[] am.
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_008~2_npc3=<npc4>...!
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_009~2_npc4=Look, I don't know about the rest of you but... this <hook.mf:guy/lady/person>'s right. What are we doing? We're hurting people... We've lost sight of... Just, [i]everything[]. Right? I wanted to be a... I...
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_009~3_npc=Shut your <npc4.mf:brother/sister/sibling> up, <npc3>.
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_010~1_npc4=Well, yeah. Of [i]course[]. That's what everyone wanted, once, isn't it?
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_011~1_legend=Oh, please. Let <npc4.mf:him/her/them> talk. You wanted to be what, <npc4>? A hero?
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_012~3_npc4=Come on, <npc3>! We always played as [i]knights[]. Never as bandits, bullies...
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_013~1_npc3=Get out of here, <npc4>.[face:sad]
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_014~4_legend=No. No, why don't you stay? <npc>, show <npc4> what happens to heroes.
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_015~1_narration=<npc> obeys, without warning or word of any kind. Unslings <npc.mf:his/her/their> spear and skewers the young <npc4.mf:man/woman/disobedient>.
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_015~2_npc3=No, n--!
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_015~3_action=[cherry]slrt!!
~06~player_chose_no.test_fail~panel_017~5_hook=Just threw away your chance of survival.
