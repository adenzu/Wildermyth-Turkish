~01~~panel_001~2_hook=So passes... [i]who?[]
~01~~panel_001~3_hook2=Vulten, wasn't it? Volter?
~01~~panel_004~4_hook2=<hook2.personality:Little unfortunate. I think there was some interesting history coming out of that <legend.mf:man/woman/character>. An interesting version of things, anyway./[face:interested]Shouldn't I [i]feel[] something? My heart unshackled? Or something like that?/[face:happy]I guess we can fix a curse the same way we solve all our problems: with pointy objects./I don't [i]feel[] any different.[face:skeptical]/That's an odd feeling. I feel completely [i]justified.[] Maybe I shouldn't?/I don't know. Kind of dull. I don't [i]feel[] different. \nIf that's cursebreaking, it's heatless./Thank you for taking this weird road with me. I'm good calling it done. Even if the curse isn't broken. I'm tired, and you're tired./That wasn't satisfying.[face:neutral]/A fish'll forget it was hooked, folks say. Drawn into breathless space, before escaping, or being let loose. And so it'll be hooked again. Let's have long memories, you and me./[face:grim]I've worried all my life over that curse. Was this all? Was it just a strange <legend.mf:man/woman/person>'s whimsical plot? I feel like the fool in the story./[face:skeptical]I'm going to start telling people I'm the \nreincarnated <hook2.mf:King/Queen/Emperor> of Bellybutton Hill.>
~01~~panel_004~5_hook=[small]<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]Oh, be quiet./[face:skeptical]Mm. Well./[face:grim]Mm. Well./==>
~01~~panel_005~4_hook2=<hook.goofball/hothead/80:[face:interested]/[face:dubious]/>
~01~~panel_005~5_hook=<hook.goofball/hothead/80:Want to burn the house?[face:happy]/Hey, but now, let's burn the house down.[face:neutral]/Do we burn the house?>
~01~~panel_005~6_narration=They don't.
~01~~panel_005~7_narration=They leave it like a gravemarker and go.
~01~~panel_006~6_narration=And peace follows with a turning year. \nDeaf sleep where once a voice pecked and burrowed.
~01~~panel_006~7_narration=<hook2> will find that <hook2.mf:he knows/she knows/they know> it for sure, one day: \nthat the curse, whatever weight it might have carried, is gone.
~01~~panel_007~6_narration=And somehow, in the wild, twenty long seasons later...
~01~~panel_007~7_action=gasp!
~01~~panel_008~8_legend=[light]Mm? Mm.
~01~~panel_009~8_legend=[light]<random:Beh. It actually went better that time./Krff. Seagull-heads./Blrk. That was the best one yet./Fwoo. I'm [i]hungry...[]>
~01~~panel_011~8_legend=[light]Suppose we must try again.
