~01~~panel_001~4_narration=The things turn to mush as they die. They puddle, then seep into the ground.
~01~~panel_001~6_hook2=Well... I don't know what that was, but...
~01~~panel_002~1_speech=[darkGray]It was disease! And now it's gone!
~01~~panel_002~2_hook=I'm already feeling so much better at digesting.\nSo. The remedy must've worked.
~01~~panel_003~6_hook2=Come on, <hook>, this's obviously some absolutely bizarre trick... The pig's a god or a lostling or something.
~01~~panel_003~7_hook=Well... I mean, I'm pretty sure the pig's my [i]conscience.[]
~01~~panel_004~1_speech=[darkGray]It also doesn't matter.
~01~~panel_005~6_hook2=[i]Huh?[]
~01~~panel_005~7_hook=Yeah, and that's the other thing. You can't really argue with results.
~01~~panel_005~8_speech=[darkGray]Goodbye...! [brown]*gool* *gool* [darkGray]Goodbye...
~01~~panel_006~4_narration=It's several weeks before they're home again.
~01~~panel_006~5_hook2=Can smell that half across town.
~01~~panel_007~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:talking]Hey, you're raising a stink. Actually it smells good./Hey, here's the mushrooms you wanted./Hey, my mighty honeybear. Came for a cuddle./==> What book you got, now? A cookbook?
~01~~panel_008~2_hook="Simmer the onions and garlic til they look like glass and maggots. Heap it up and give it a good sniff. Ah, how nice! Now throw it away, because it's time for the rice..."
~01~~panel_009~2_hook=Oh, it's the same one as before. The back two thirds, it just becomes Doctor <npc.lastname>'s "Culinary Vulneraries." <npc.mf:He was/She was/They were> also an ambitious and wonderful chef, it seems.
~01~~panel_010~3_hook2=Hm. That's... Well, but listen, <hook>... I've been thinking some more, and... Doesn't it [i]still[] make the most sense if that wasn't a disease at all? I mean, it seems like some kind of... illusory... thing?
~01~~panel_011~3_hook2=Right, well... that's the other part of the...
~01~~panel_012~2_hook=An illusory [i]thing?[] Why would it be inside my body, then?
~01~~panel_013~5_hook2=Of the...
~01~~panel_014~5_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:neutral]That's just the other leg of the ham, I guess. \nDon't they say that? Someone says that./But you [i]are[] feeling better?/[face:talking]I guess you [i]feel[] better, love?/==>
~01~~panel_014~6_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:No one does. Of that much I'm certain./Yeah, <hook.greedy/healer/hothead/loner/romantic:my fingers feel eager again, for counting/my heartbeat doesn't have bees in it/my appetite's returned/I've got control of my words more/this tongue's kiss-ready again>. <hook.bookish/coward/goofball/leader/snark:My mind's mostly unmurked./My inner passages are clear./I've got my great laugh back./I'm whistling tuneful as a bird./My mouth's got it's regular rosepeach taste.>/Yeah, <hook.greedy/healer/hothead/loner/romantic:my fingers feel eager again, for counting/my heartbeat doesn't have bees in it/my appetite's returned/I've got control of my words more/this tongue's kiss-ready again>. <hook.bookish/coward/goofball/leader/snark:My mind's mostly unmurked./My inner passages are clear./I've got my great laugh back./I'm whistling tuneful as a bird./My mouth's got it's regular rosepeach taste.>/==>
~01~~panel_015~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Right. Well. I'll just quit arguing. Hey, what're you making, though? The smell's what drew me here./[face:interested]Okay, well, maybe it [i]is[] true. You can't argue with results. So what's the thing you're making?/Well then, I know better than to keep questioning it. I do. I [i]know better[]. So, uh. What're you making? That our dinner?/==>
~01~~panel_015~4_hook=It's crawdads, ultimately. The recipe's just [i]very[] circuitous.
~01~~panel_016~3_hook2=Oh! Crawdads!?
~01~~panel_017~4_hook=<hook.coward/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Mhmm... Spooky crawdads.../[face:joy]Yep! Hot fresh crawdads!/[face:talking]Yep!
