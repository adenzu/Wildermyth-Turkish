.name=Result
~01~~panel_001~1_narration=Blood runs black in the ashy dust.
~01~~panel_002~2_npc=I'm sorry... I wish you hadn't been here for this.
~01~~panel_003~3_hook2=<hook2.coward/greedy/healer/poet/romantic/60:[face:interested]Who [i]are[] they? Or were they, I guess...? \nPlease tell me there's not more coming./You can consider our debt paid, I think. \nBut who... uh, you know. Who was that?/[face:grim]It's alright. Do you need to go inside? \nCan you say who they were?/[face:grim]We're glad we were. Though it's a bitter night when peace is bought with human blood. Tell me... who were they?/[face:interested]What do you mean? If we hadn't... \nwell, but who were these people?/No, it's good we [i]were[]. Who were these people?>
~01~~panel_004~4_npc=Just bandits, really. They were called the Latchlifters.
~01~~panel_005~4_npc=That <legend.mf:man/woman/person>, <legend>, founded <legend.mf:his/her/their> crew when <legend.mf:he was/she was/they were> run out of <town> for killing <legend.mf:his wife/her husband/their partner>. <legend.mf:He was/She was/They were> set up, as it turned out. But truth too often arrives late.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=They spend the greater part of the remaining night burying their assailants in decent graves.
~01~~panel_007~7_npc=I knew <legend.mf:him/her/them> from back then. Never thought I'd... Anyway, <legend.mf:he/she/they> came to me for weapons, couple seasons back. Didn't give me much choice. And despite what they all said, I handed them fine work. Better than I should've done.
~01~~panel_008~7_npc=<town>'s fisherfolk say something like: "Release a bad catch and you only pass ill luck to another." I should've refused them. Even if they killed me.
~01~~panel_008~8_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/hothead/goofball/healer/romantic/snark/60:[face:skeptical]Your miscalculation was in not telling us weeks ago, when we first met./[face:sad]You can't just... I mean, no one knows what would've happened. Right?/[face:angry]Why? Why should you have died? Is that bravery, you think?/[face:skeptical]Weird comparison. A bad fish doesn't murder you and jump back in the river./[face:talking]You did what you could. And now it's all turned out for the best. Alright?/Tragic, but this poor <legend.mf:man/woman/person>... the fault was <legend.mf:his/hers/theirs>. Your death wouldn't stop it./[face:dubious]Right, because that would've stopped them./That's nonsense. Who can say what other grief they might've caused?>
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=The toil eventually demands silence.
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=They return in the predawn hour.
~01~~panel_010~8_hook=It's alright. We need sleep.
~01~~panel_010~9_npc=Consider any cost now settled with me.\nI'm sorry, once more. I have to say it.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=The next few days, <hook> and <npc> work together to finish the task.
~01~~panel_011~2_narration=<hook2> prepares a cart full of the weapons they'll take home.
~01~~panel_012~2_narration=The smith continues to give <hook> pointers, even down to the final night.
~01~~panel_012~7_npc=You have the talent, you know?\nYou could make a living at this.
~01~~panel_013~4_narration=In the morning, they're on their way.
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=They travel the long quiet forest road...
~01~~panel_015~1_hook=...and camp close to sunset.
~01~~panel_015~7_narration=They stand digesting their meals, listening to twilight birds and chirps of the fire.
~01~~panel_016~5_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Clouds from earlier have cleared./Stars should be plentiful, tonight. No moon./You're in another world, tonight.>
~01~~panel_016~6_hook=Hm?
~01~~panel_017~6_hook=Oh.
~01~~panel_018~6_hook=Know what I've been thinking?
~01~~panel_018~7_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:No./What?/What is it?/>
~01~~panel_019~2_hook=<hook.snark/loner/60:That was alright./That was alright./I really enjoyed that.> Making things. Making [i]good[] things. <hook.bookish/snark/60:Acquiring those skills and lessons. And using them to conjure something of myself out of the materials./Like, yeah, I was still terrible at it. But by the end, I could at least suggest forms to the metal, and it would sometimes listen./Building the skills. Being able to have an idea, and then express it in solid form.>

~01~~panel_020~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]/[face:happy]/-->
~01~~panel_021~1_hook=Maybe someday, I'll take up my own thing. Metalwork, or clay, or wood. I'll be an artisan myself. Maybe I'll get that chance...
~01~~panel_022~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]Hm. Probably not, though./[face:skeptical]Sure. I bet you could./<hook2.greedy.60:I mean... yeah. I'd run a little shop with you, if you wanted./[face:happy]If you want to, you'll do it.>/-->
