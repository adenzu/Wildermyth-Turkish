~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook2=<Town> seems to drift in the night, a haunted ship slicing still seas in silence. The village languishes in the grips of an awful disease: many lives taken, many more taken ill.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook2=Is that <hook>?
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_hook=<hook2><hook.rfln.hook2:. I thought you'd left town./. You look well enough./. You're beautiful./--->
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook2=No one is on the streets but them. The stink of disease curls out each window. Only crickets and the occasional owlsong are there to remember the world won't end tonight.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/leader/loner/poet:I guess the logical thing to conclude would be... fate brought you./Then fate sends me much-needed aid.../Fate has chosen you to accompany me, then./Is this also fate?/Fate is a <hook.rfln.hook2:veiled stranger/twinned sail/sealed rose/--->, tonight.> <hook.rfln.hook2:/<hook.loner/romantic/60:I thought I'd walk alone.../Do you find yourself guided by this same star?/I can't say I'm sorry to see you.>/<hook.loner/romantic/60:I'm glad it's <hook2.mf:him,her,them>, if it was anyone.../Your star and mine so often spiral close./I'm glad you're here.>/--->
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Is fate what we're talking about?/<hook.loner/romantic/60:So you often think. Where are you going?/<hook2.snark.50:Um... do I find myself guided by things/Talking about stars again>?/You feel something happening?>/<hook.loner/romantic/60:/<hook2.romantic.50:[face:sad]And rarely touch, I'm sorry to say.../Yeah. True.>/Seems like... you're planning on leaving?>/--->
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=[white]It hangs over me, <hook2>: a brilliant lodestar. <hook.rfln.hook2:I set out tonight, to follow it. And you must join me./I'm setting out tonight. I think you're supposed to come./The road will be long. I feel the morning I was born for soon may dawn./--->
~01~prompt~panel_008.(hook_and_hook2_are_rivals)~1_hook2=<hook.poet/goofball/romantic/60:Don't you think you're taking it a little far this time?/This is strange theater, <hook>, if that's what it is./This is strange theater, <hook>, if that's what it is./Are you okay? You don't sound like yourself.>
~01~prompt~panel_009.(hook_and_hook2_are_friends)~1_hook2=<hook.poet/goofball/romantic/60:Don't you think you're taking it a little far this time?/This is strange theater, <hook>, if that's what it is./This is strange theater, <hook>, if that's what it is./Are you okay? You don't sound like yourself.>
~01~prompt~panel_010.(hook_and_hook2_are_lovers)~1_hook2=The morning you were born for...?
~01~prompt~panel_011.(hook_and_hook2_are_lovers)~1_hook2=<hook2.healer/hothead/romantic:I'll be there when it comes. Count on me./Well whatever it brings, I'll stand by you./Which horizon should I look to?>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook=We go to a wild place that appeared to me in a dream. There's a poison in this town that was born somewhere distant.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:interested]/--->
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook2=I don't suppose there's a chance this was just a dream? Just like any other dream...?
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hook=No. <hook.coward/poet/leader/snark:I can't explain it, but... I've been living under the shadow of this doom my whole life./There's muckish dreams, sleepweeds... and then there's true ones. Seeds that always flower true. I've learned to tell the difference./<hook.rfln.hook2:I know you don't always believe me. But/You trust me, don't you? Well,/If you trust me,/---> just know that there are things that happen to me that are meant to happen. This is one of them./I mean, I understand why you... Look, it sounds ludicrous, I know. If I'm wrong, at least we'll know I was wrong. And in that case, I'm also probably crazy. >
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_darken=The journey begins at the dawnward tip of the year's longest night.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_darken=Perhaps it's merely coincidence...
~01~prompt~panel_015~3_darken=...or perhaps destiny's hand has touched the scales.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook=Truly there is no solider thing than fate.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=Hold up... We can't leave tonight. Look at the shape of the moon.
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
