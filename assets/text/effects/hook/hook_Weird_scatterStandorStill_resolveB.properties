~01~~panel_003~2_hook="Simmer the onions and garlic til they look like glass and maggots. Heap it up and give it a good sniff. Ah, how nice! Now throw it away, because it's time for the rice..."
~01~~panel_004~2_hook=Oh, it's the same one as before. The back two thirds, it just becomes Doctor <npc.lastname>'s "Culinary Vulneraries." <npc.mf:He was/She was/They were> also an ambitious and wonderful chef, it seems.
~01~~panel_005~3_hook2=Hm.

And it's valuable, and full of [i]insight.[]/My inner world is a little more vibrant, but it's become a welcoming place to me, again./I've got my great laugh back, and it's full of a multitude of tiny voices./I'm whistling tuneful as a bird, and I hear them also. In me, these harmonies./My mouth's got it's regular rosepeach taste, but my throat's stronger, kind of, you know? Hard to explain, maybe.>
~01~~panel_009~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Well. Stop. Instead, tell me what you're making./Yeah, alright you can stop describing it. And just, as an aside, maybe don't go on about it to other people either. Um, but what's that you're making?/Well, it's your innards, so I won't argue. Just... Actually let's talk about what you're making, how about that? Dinner?/==>
~01~~panel_009~4_hook=Crawdads, ultimately. The recipe is [i]very[] circuitous.
