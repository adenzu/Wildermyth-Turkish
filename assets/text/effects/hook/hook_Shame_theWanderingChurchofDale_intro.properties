~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=Trekking the narrow <season> roads of nowhere, a sudden illness clogs <hook>'s chest, shoots barbs through <hook.mf:his/her/their> veins, rouses <hook.mf:him/her/them> in the night to kneel heaving in the dark outside the tent.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=So far, <hook.mf:he's/she's/they've> pushed through, hoping it would ebb.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_action=[pink]Grk!!
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:sad]/-->
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_narration=Instead, it's worsening.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]<hook2.healer/leader/60:Alright, since I know you won't ask me to stop, I'll do it. Can we stop? We'll camp here. Drink some water and try to eat something if you can keep it down./You know, I'll say it. You've got an impressive amount of determination inside you. But now I think it's time we camp. Long camp, if we have to./<hook.personality:Hey, aren't you supposed to be the smart one? Stop your feet and give me your stuff./Hey, alright. Who're we running from that we have to keep marching on like this? You scared? It's fine./Okay, if this is all an elaborate prank, I [i]will[] kill you. But.../You know, you always look out for yourself, first. Why're you holding out now? Here./Annoying. You try to take care of everyone, but when it's you... well, look at you!/Look, yell at me if you want, but if you die, everyone'll blame me./Alright, champion, you're flagging pretty hard at this point./You're unbelievable, you know that? You'd never ask to stop, even if it killed you. Well.../Ugly face. But I get the point./Hey, hero, you've done it: I [i]believe[] you./Spare me your barbs and listen.> We're camping here. Sit down and drink some water.>/[face:sad]<hook2.personality:Nothing I've read about illness tells me you should keep walking when you're on the brink of collapse./Yeesh, <hook> slow down, you'll collapse./[face:happy]Was that a 'Grk' of affection, or are you about to fall?/Hey, I want to get home as fast as you do, but you're pushing too hard./That's enough of that. You need rest./[face:angry]Hey, you trying to kill yourself?/[face:grim]Hey, <hook>. Let's rest a while, I'm worn out. In fact.../Idiot./Look at you. The color of blighted moss./Yes, you're being brave, <hook>. But enough's enough./Sounding real healthy there, <hook>. 'Grk'ing up a storm.> Here, let's camp in this spot. Looks defensible./[face:grim]<hook>, <hook.personality:don't tell me all that study's left you dull? You have to stop./you're trying to run from it and you can't./no laughing it off this time./I know you want your bed, but.../if you won't rest for your own good, do it for [i]mine[]./you ox-head, quit pushing yourself!/you know better than this. Time to stop./this is why I can't let you be alone. Stop, please./are you completely lost in your head? Stop, please./I need you to live, love. Stop being a hero./you don't have to keep putting up a front. Please.> We'll set up a long camp here. <hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/snark/60:Exertion's the worst thing. Give me a chance to forage and concoct some tonics./Honestly, you look terrible, and I'm... I'm scared./[face:interested]And if you're going to be sick, at least let me feed you gross medicines./[face:skeptical]Might be bad at it, but let me take care of you./I can take care of you, if you'll let me.>/-->
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_narration=<hook.rfln.hook2:As <hook2> goes to gather firewood for the night and morning, <hook> eases down, cradling <hook.mf:himself/herself/themself>, sipping from <hook.mf:his/her/their> canteen./<hook2> sets <hook> down, then goes off for firewood, enough to last the night and the following morning. <hook> sips from <hook.mf:his/her/their> canteen.

Sunset's not yet close./--->
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=And, odd enough, that's when a faith-called pilgrim comes down the road.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc=You're bad off, aren't you, earth<hook.mf:son/daughter/child>? You look it.\nDo you mind if I stoop down and listen to your signs?
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=I'm <npc.fullname>. No one worth fearing. Pilgrim of an order that's never been popular, a god who'd never ask to be.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=...whoever you... are, I...[gray] *huff*
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_narration=The pilgrim bends down and places fingers on <hook>'s pulse. Holds a coin before <hook.mf:his/her/their> mouth, then an ear to <hook.mf:his/her/their> upper chest.
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_npc=Hm.
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/snark/60:You know... medicine?/Hm? Is that... bad?/Hm. Right. That's helpful./>
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_npc=I've seen symptoms like these, certainly. Your <hook.human_eyepatch:eye's/<hook.themePiece_gorgon_headCrust:eye's/eyes are>> still clear. That's good. How long've you...?
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_hook2=Three days. Just three.\nWho're you?
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_npc=You <hook.mf:his/her/their> friend?<hook.rfln.hook2: More than that, maybe?// Or more, maybe?/---> Well... That <hook.mf:man/woman/poor one>'s suffering from [i]Igochorra[]. Rare disease. Folks get it in <season>, a wayward spore. I can treat it, but to cure it is impossible. Or nearly, I suppose I should say.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_narration=<npc>'s administered a small elixir made from water and wild barrowbell, as well as some burnt, crushed mushrooms. <npc.mf:He/She/They> told <hook> to sleep, and <hook.mf:he's/she's/they've> been in the tent ever since.
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_narration=A while later...
~01~prompt~panel_014~3_hook2=<hook2.personality:You know your plants./[face:skeptical]<hook>'ll be alright?/[face:happy]So... what other potions you do?/[face:skeptical]What're you after, though?/Precious thing, sleep./[face:angry]Kept telling <hook.mf:him/her/them> to slow down..../You have our gratitude./Your potion actually worked./A holy healer's hands.../[face:happy]You're a good <npc.mf:man/woman/person>./[face:skeptical]You sure came along fortuitously.>
~01~prompt~panel_015~4_npc=<hook.mf:He/She/They>'ll need more of this elixir. The rest of <hook.mf:his/her/their> life, <hook.mf:he/she/they>'ll need it. [i]Igochorra[] leaves husks where happiness was. It's a brutal way to go.
~01~prompt~panel_015~5_hook2=You mentioned a cure.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_npc=And I shouldn't have. It's one of those convenient stories about a miraculous heal-all, I... Once, long ago, I tried to find it. The journey cost my <npc2.mf:brother his/sister her/sibling their> life. By the time I'd returned, empty-handed, the man it would've healed had already passed.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_npc=Desperate hearts are reckless. Treat the disease patiently, and <hook.mf:he/she/they>'ll live longer.
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_hook=<hook.personality:[face:skeptical]Timidity is an enemy of wisdom, just as surely as undue haste./[face:sad]You're saying I'm doomed, aren't you? That it's only a matter of time?/[face:happy]Sounds like I've got a lot to look forward to./Think [i]I'll[] be the one to decide how my heartbeats are spent./[face:happy]You mix good medicine. Not a pleasant conversation to wake to, however.../[i]No one's[] deciding how long I live but me. What's the other side of this story?/[face:skeptical]What exactly are the risks?/Talking about [i]me[]?/[face:talking]You know that worry wakes an ailing body, don't you?/[face:happy]Would it help if I told you I'm \n<hook.fullname>?/[face:dubious]Well that's a [i]pleasant[] thing to wake up to.>
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_npc=Oh! You're already looking better. \nSome constitution, you must have.
~01~prompt~panel_019~3_hook=Feel a lot stronger, and I thank you. But so tell me. Tell us both. About this cure...
~01~prompt~panel_019~4_hook2=<hook>...
~01~prompt~panel_020~6_npc=O, Dale, my goddess, my god.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_npc=[gray]Is this the purpose my wandering feet follow? If it is, and it must be... I'll trust my feet. I will.
~01~prompt~panel_021~2_narration=<npc.mf:He mumbles/She mumbles/They mumble> into the fire, a moment.
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_narration=Then meets their eyes again.
~01~prompt~panel_022~6_npc=Our paths brought us all here.\nWho am I to deny my place?
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_npc=...and in summary... since you seem set on seeking it out....
~01~prompt~panel_023~2_narration=They huddle close to the flames as the pilgrim, <npc.fullname> reluctantly describes a distant place, a harrowing guardian, a legendary restorative.
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_npc=Please. Let me accompany you. It's clear to me that I was put in your path for [i]this[] holy duty. You'll need the elixir, regardless, and I can teach you to make it.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_narration=So they sleep there, that night, and set out the next day.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_narration=Before all this...
~03~choice_no~panel_001~2_hook2=A <season> journey's the last thing on my mind! Everyone's talking about a bridge.
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
