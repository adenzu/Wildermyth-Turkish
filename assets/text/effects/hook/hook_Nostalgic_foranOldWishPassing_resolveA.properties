~01~~panel_002~1_hook=<hook.loner/snark/60:[face:grim]The last light lingers, this time of year./[face:skeptical]I guess the fading light's a symbol, sometimes?/We've managed to catch the very last of the light.>
~01~~panel_003~2_npc=Do you think we upset her? The goddess?
~01~~panel_004~3_hook2=<hook2.personality:Gods aren't like us. Their judgment isn't easy to sway, but they do accept appeasement. Speaking from all I've read, anyway./[face:skeptical]After that, you're unsure? Tell you what, \n[i]I[] wouldn't ever go back there./[face:joy]She'll get over it.../I wouldn't [i]over[]-worry. She won't stop wanting what she couldn't \nhave today. That's greed. Gods get it harder than we do, I bet./[face:happy]Gods may be slow to forget, but I imagine they're amenable to gifts. Citrus. Coffees. Something nice./[face:skeptical]What right does [i]she[] have to get upset? \nIf anything, we let her off easy.../You can't worry about that. The people who don't want the best for you shouldn't be your concern. That includes gods./[face:grim]Why? You don't [i]owe[] her anything.\nNo sense dwelling on it./If we never upset the gods, we wouldn't be human. Life's mostly about changing your mind, I think./[face:happy]It's another chapter in your lovestory. Drawn by the lurid deathful promise of a greedy god, you defied her, at the last.../[face:dubious]Of course we did. And you know how much it matters? Not a bit. What's best for [i]you[] isn't what she was offering.>
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=It's a thoughtful journey back to the farm \n<npc> and <npc2> once built.
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=<npc> seems to be developing\na habit for silence.
~01~~panel_006~2_narration=But then <npc.mf:he sighs/she sighs/they sigh> ..
~01~~panel_007~7_hook=At least one of us should be getting back.\nBut one of us could stay.
~01~~panel_008~6_npc=I think... I [i]will[] bury <npc2.mf:him/her/them>. Here, on the farm.\nAnd I'll... stay. A little longer. Long as I can.
~01~~panel_009~6_npc=I'm very grateful to you... I'll keep in touch, and I'll... well. What can I really promise?
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=So <hook> and <hook2> go, with well-wishes and word that they'll drop by as\nseasons pass. Words of love for <npc>, who'll need them in <npc.mf:his/her/their> dark hours.
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=<npc.mf:He sends/She sends/They send> them on with gifts, some of what <npc.mf:he/she/they> and <npc2> stockpiled, over the years.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=Day by day, <npc.mf:he/she/they>'ll return to <npc.mf:his/her/their> normal life, and though <npc.mf:his/her/their> heart won't ever stop honoring <npc2>, <npc> will find something to love again...

Your annoying attitude [i]helped[] <npc.mf:him/her/them>, I think./You know, I don't think of you as a particularly [i]generous[] person.../You're pretty generous, I guess. You don't know <npc> as well as I do, but.../You know, for such a rough-talking ass, you did well back there./I'm not big on your whole attitude, mostly. But the assurance seemed to help <npc> feel better.../You know, that's not usually your style, is it? \nYou're normally colder.../It's not often I like what you say... but it\nhelped <npc> to hear it, I think./You know, you talk a lot of nonsense. But I think you helped <npc>, back there.../Surprisingly sincere, <hook2>. That's what I'd say. I'm a little shocked.>/[face:grim]It's hard to let the good things go./I don't know if I could ever let you go./-->
~01~~panel_013~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]<npc.mf:He/She/They> needed strong friends. \nYou did well yourself./<hook2.greedy/loner/snark/60:[face:talking]We undervalue our friendships, sometimes.

All the knowledge in the world can't save you from despair./[face:interested]I'll admit... I'd hide in a thick-walled house, never come out again. Without you all./[face:joy]And that's when you dig your heels in. Really make them drag you. That's love!/[face:skeptical]And you owe it to them to return the favor. Wonder if <npc>'ll ever pay us back, someway./[face:happy]Gives me hope, really. There's no one beyond our help./[face:skeptical]People are so flakey and fragile. It's a good thing there's us, isn't it?/[face:happy]True enough. It takes all of us, for any of us to matter. To keep going. To [i]change[] things./[face:grim]I wouldn't have said so. But... I haven't reached the end, I suppose./[face:grim]The trees sway for the rain. Roses flare for the sun. We weep, exalt, slay and die... for love./[face:sad]<hook.npcRomance:Oh, my love, wherever you are... not even death will part us. I promise you. Not even death./You know... I'd still wish to experience a love like theirs. Even if only to lose it in a week.>/[face:skeptical]But I'm not sure what it means, really. We're clinging creatures. That's what we are.>>//-->
