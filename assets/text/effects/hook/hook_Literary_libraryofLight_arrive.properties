.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> have arrived at the location on their map..
.longName=Library of Light
.name=Event
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.goofball/healer/poet:There's no correct version of this story... But that's why it's <hook.goofball.65:fun!/interesting.>/I've heard many versions of this story. I used to collect them, try to piece them together... /Old Pen-Shope <npc.firstname>, a wise <npc.mf:man/woman/person> who lived in Skybarrow, told me this: every worthy legend has a hundred good variations...>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=According to most tellings, the [forest]Library of Light[] was <hook.hothead/leader/romantic:mortared together with magic, built from bricks cut off the moon.../built out of peat-clay, all dug and wheeled load by load out of the monstered deeps.../carved whole, shaped from a single limb that fell off the tree of stars...>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook=Most say the <hook.hothead/leader/romantic:Emberwold/Morningstar/Watersong> <legend.mf:Sorceror/Sorceress/Sorceror>, <legend.fullname>, brought the Library into being. Some storytellers have it that <hook.hothead/leader/romantic:a great many mystics helped <legend.mf:him/her/them>, and <legend.mf:he/she/they> promptly chained them all to a volcano afterwards and sent them into space. And that is now the comet Amestitus./<legend.mf:he/she/they> enlisted the aid of dreamweavers and morthificers. When it was built, the monsters destroyed each other in their greed, as monsters will./<legend.mf:he/she/they> beguiled a great <legend.mf:goddess/god/god> and tricked <legend.mf:her/him/them> into performing the labors. Then bound <legend.mf:her/him/them> in a wineflask and cast it out upon the Eternal Sea.>
~01~prompt~panel_004.(hook_is_coward)~1_hook=[light]One version has <legend.mf:him/her/them> using <legend.mf:his/her/their> own life to complete the casting... Yuck.
~01~prompt~panel_005.(hook_is_greedy)~1_hook=[light]In some stories, <legend.mf:he ends/she ends/they end> up \nshouldering an eternal debt to \nsome Lostling or Netherbeast...
~01~prompt~panel_006.(hook_is_snark)~1_hook=[light]One version has <legend.mf:him/her/them> drinking Mulnish Mead... in literally every scene.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=<hook.coward/greedy/snark:That one's gross./That comes with awful interest, I'm sure./I suspect advertisers are behind that one.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook=There's the one where <legend.mf:he visits/she visits/they visit> the Spirit Realm...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=[light]I don't remember why. I don't think anything happens. Maybe <legend.mf:he/she/they> just wanted to visit.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/poet:The consensus is that <legend.mf:he was/she was/they were> a seeker of wisdom, someone who saw knowledge itself as the greatest treasure, highest goal./[face:happy]Honestly, it was <legend.mf:his/her/their> name that first intrigued me: <legend.fullname>! There's a mystery there, right?/There's many versions of <legend>, but I prefer the stories that paint <legend.mf:him/her/them> human.>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=<hook.hothead/poet:Of course, half of history never happened. So.../The stories have always been like starlight. Scattered and small and uncertain...>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook=<hook.hothead/poet:<legend.mf:His/Her/Their> name and the deeds that went with it might be one more easy fiction. If the library [i]is[] real.../...but bound with this magnetic gram that draws the fragments together. Becomes this single childish hope. This enduring, embarrassing sense of... [i]what if[]?>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook=Can you imagine it? A limitless and ever-growing trove of books? Every volume that's been written? Every scroll? Every epic?
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_self=They'll arrive the next day.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_self=How should they spend the night?
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:joy]/[face:happy]/>
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~3_narration=Fire and conversation.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=Pensive stargazing.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~1_narration=The fire is high, and their <hook.rfln.hook2:differences seem tonight like strengths./friendship deepens./love deepens./>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~3_narration=The night gives them courage.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~1_narration=But the next morning, they'll reach their goal...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_007~1_narration=...and find it guarded!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]You ever going to sleep?/[face:interested]You going to wander off?/[face:happy]You wishing for something?/>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~3_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Eventually.../Just thinking about my youth./Wishing for everything, I guess./>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~1_narration=The stars get swept away in clouds.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~2_narration=But there's a momentous feeling in the air, in the minds of <hook> and <hook2>, that gives them dreams and wakes them with purpose.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~1_narration=In the morning, they'll reach their goal...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~1_narration=...and find it guarded!
