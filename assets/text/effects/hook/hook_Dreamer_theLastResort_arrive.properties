.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> have arrived at <site>.
.longName=The Last Resort
.name=Event
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook2=A thickgrown woodland seems to invite them under its boughs. Wood and damp and the <season> herbs that grow here all combine for a heady fragrant zest in the air.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hook2=<hook2.coward/greedy/healer/loner/romantic/snark/60:I'm usually on edge in places like this. But it's nice here./I'd like to make this place my own, one day. Good for a seasonal getaway./Now when I think of a quiet peaceful place to go... this is what I'll think of./Something lives here. Lives alone./You could imagine lovers might come here. Caught up in some blazing forbidden tryst./Good spot for a spirit-type encounter./It's a pleasant place, I won't say it isn't.> Standing stones are kind of unusual.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_npc=[light]Hey, who're you dingots? Setting up camp on my doorstep? Get away from my omenstones.
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_hook2=This place yours?
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_hook=[gray]Ask <npc.mf:his/her/their> name.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_npc=[light]Hey, no need for the... I didn't see you had weapons.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=[light]You outlaws? You don't have to kill me...
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hook=We were startled, that's all.
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_hook2=<npc.mf:He's/She's/They're> old.
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_hook=My name's <hook>, this's <hook2>. We're from far away...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_npc=[light]<hook>? But... You're the <hook.whm:grisly fighter/wilderness <hook.mf:man/woman/person>/strange <hook.mf:sorcerer/sorceress/sorcerer>> from my dream.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_npc=[light]My name is <npc.fullname>. <npc> of Omens, is how I'm known in <town>. And now, it seems...
~01~prompt~panel_013~4_npc=[light]Please, come with me.
~01~prompt~panel_013~5_hook2=[gray]<hook>...
~01~prompt~panel_014~4_hook2=[gray]<hook2.coward/healer/leader/loner/60:<npc.mf:He creeps/She creeps/They creep> me out. Be ready to run./I want to trust <npc.mf:him/her/them>. But we don't know <npc.mf:him/her/them>. Be wise./I'll be on my guard. You should be, too./<npc.mf:He/She/They> may not [i]want[] visitors./Let's stay wary, that's all.>
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hook2=The woodland <npc.mf:fellow/woman/person> leads them among the trees...
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hook2=...to the door of <npc.mf:his/her/their> secluded home.
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_npc=[light]Be welcome. There's barkcheese and brined pork. Also upon my table, please find [i]enlightenment[].
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_hook2=<hook2.bookish/healer/loner/60:An idyllic existence out here.../This cheese is perfect.../Just you out here?/You keep a nice table...>
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_npc=[light]These old beams have stood me well. I chose a lucky spot, but I had the advantage of dreaming it. See, I've had dreams since I was a small <npc.mf:boy/girl/child>.
~01~prompt~panel_020~3_hook=Dreams. <hook.personality:Dreams of a prophetic nature, I assume you mean?/Dreams that... frighten you? How real they seem?/Random, weird sometimes. But true-turning./True ones. You feel you should be able to profit from them./But more than dreams, right? I'm sorry./Drive you crazy, don't they? So real.../True ones. Chances to change the future./No one understands your dreams but you./Windows to tomorrow. Visions./But never the amorous kind. Future-telling ones./Even dogs have dreams. But you mean...>
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_npc=[light]Dreams that portend what may come. My grandmother was a seer also. Something some folks get born with, I suppose.
~01~prompt~panel_021~2_action=[actionSmall]whisk!
~01~prompt~panel_022~2_action=[actionSmall][maroon]thoop!
~01~prompt~panel_022~3_narration=<npc.mf:He swigs/She swigs/They swig> bright blackberry wine.
~01~prompt~panel_023~3_hook=<hook.coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:I know what fear does to people./[face:interested]I know that feeling. Came after you, didn't they?/Poor <npc.mf:man/woman/you>. They didn't understand./I were you, I'd have fought about it.../As they will. You didn't try to change their minds?/People are only well-shorn beasts./[face:dubious]I wish I found that surprising./In <town>, huh?>
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_npc=[light]I was a young <npc.mf:man/woman/person> when I got run out of town. <npc> of Omens, they called me. I'd told them the stores would burn, and so they did. It was a stray cinder. Folks blamed me.
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_npc=[light]But I knew it would happen. I told my mother and ailing father, and left before the drunks showed up. My parents got to stay, and live happily, and visited me often in the later years.
~01~prompt~panel_025~2_action=[actionSmall]slosh
~01~prompt~panel_026~3_npc=[light]Life out here has been lonely sometimes, yeah. But rewarding in many ways. Time to time, folks come, and they drink from the well of sights my dreams have filled in me...
~01~prompt~panel_027~2_hook2=<hook>...
~01~prompt~panel_027~3_hook=The next Woodland Seer...?
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_npc=[light]And now you've come, <hook>. I'm creaking through my final years. But you've got the gift to be the next Woodland Seer.
~01~prompt~panel_029~3_npc=[light]Yes, it would be the birth of a tradition, which will only strengthen the magic. In the many years I see left for you, you can help keep this world safe, though not in the way you've done. I'll teach you. We [i]do[] have time for that.

~02~choice_yes~panel_001~3_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook.leader/loner/60:[face:grim]My first responsibility is my friends... I can't let them down./[face:grim]Being rid of <hook2> and the rest? I'd like it. But I can't./[face:skeptical]Just stay here while the others fight? I can't do that...>/<hook.goofball/loner/snark/60:[face:joy]Nice to be wanted. But my journeying's not over./[face:grim]I'd wish to live here... but something calls me back./[face:skeptical]Call me a shirker, but I don't want that kind of responsibility./My work is out [i]there[]. My calling is <hook.whm:to the field, the battle./to the track and the battle./to the world that needs my hands.>>/[face:happy]I'm sorry, but, <hook2> and I... we have other plans, don't we?/--->
~03~choice_no~panel_001~3_darken=[pink]Lose <hook>, thwart many future incursions.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~1_npc=[light]I understand.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~2_hook=<hook.personality:There're so many variables that govern our actions, our outcomes. Once, I would've accepted your offer gladly. But now.../I'm a born worrier, you see. As much as I hate going to battle with my friends, worse is not going. It would drive me crazy to sit here.../[face:joke]I think if you spent time with me, you'd realize I'm not meant for this kind of thing. I'm... well. I'm kind of silly, most of the time./There're too many things I still want to do. Places to go, food to try, stories I want to be able to tell./The idea appeals to me, and if I knew I could do real good here, then perhaps... but I know my worth to my friends./I couldn't sit still here, to be honest with you. [i]Especially[] if I knew my old friends were facing danger.../Please understand, I'm honored. But there's a role I play, and people look to me. I have to do what I know I can do./It sounds strange to hear myself say this, but... I'm not ready to leave my company behind./The owl wears the mask of a dreamer, but by night <hook.mf:she glides/he glides/they glide> awake and watchful. My vigil is on the wing, not within the perch./A life of living awaits me out there. You know that sense you get, that something grand awaits you beyond the next turn in the path...?/[face:happy]I know I'm an idiot for saying so, but I guess I'd just rather face the danger myself. If I die, not as big a loss, right?>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~1_hook2=<hook>, [i]your[] dream led us here. Do you think this...?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~1_npc=[light]What I don't understand is... why you've come. It seems you have some other purpose.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~1_narration=From outside, a tremendous roar erupts, shaking the stones of the house!

~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~1_hook=Stay here. I dreamed this place would be devoured by flames. \nI've been given the chance to stop that happening, and I will.

~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~1_hook2=<hook>, I just thought about...[i]your[] dream led us here, right? Do you think...?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~1_npc=[light]It's a busy life, in fact, and it can be draining. But you'll be able to make of it what you want.
