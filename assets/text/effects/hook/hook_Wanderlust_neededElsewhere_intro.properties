~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=Distant clouds of dust or rain drift in the late sky.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=Wind drags on <hook>'s clothes \nand the windmill roars.
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_action=[tan]...robble...!
~01~prompt~panel_001~4_action=[brown]...whoom...!
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=<hook.personality:It's nothing unseasonal, <hook>. The idea that weather patterns would warp to discourage the whims of a single <hook.mf:man/woman/person> is ludicrous. You [i]know[] that./[face:interested]Am I on a doomed journey, and I don't know it? Am I closing my eyes to the omens of a wiser world?/[face:skeptical]Look at that weird bird. It's flying backwards. That's definitely a thing to see.../What'd I do to deserve this weather? Don't go sending me signs [i]now[], universe./This's going to be pretty rough on <hook2>, huh? Maybe I should send <hook2.mf:him/her/them> home.../[face:happy]Wretched trip already! But... Naw, face it. You love this, <hook>./Everyone'll get on okay. They will. Sometimes you have to know when to let them go./Out here's the wide world I was born to roam. Mm, yes. This feels right./Go ahead, rowdy weather. Blast my path with your salty wind. I won't be deterred./Hm. Yes. Nothing looks cooler than me in this moment. I wonder if I could explain it to a painter./[face:dubious]Typical world. Getting all bitter and mean when I decide on a journey. >
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_action=[actionSmall][brown]...swshh...

~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=With a last look at fading day, <hook.mf:he goes/she goes/they go> in. An especially vicious gust fights <hook.mf:him/her/them> all the way to the entrance.

~01~prompt~panel_006~1_action=[actionSmall][tan]thmp!
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_narration=<hook> pulls the door closed. The millkeeper's a <npc2.mf:man/woman/person> named <npc2>. A stranger to them, <npc2.mf:he's/she's/they've> provided shelter anyway, and now comes from <npc2.mf:his/her/their> cellar with a jug of cool dandelion tea and cups.
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_npc2=What a wind! And wouldn't you know it, no grain to grind.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_npc2=At least it's quieter. You should hear it when the big wheel's gnawing.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_hook2=[small]<hook2.personality:Used to have this book that was the accounts of a windmill builder. Built about seven, in different spots, and wrote through the experiences of each one. Where [i]is[] that book?/[face:interested][i]Gnawing[]? That's a creepy word for it./[face:happy]Dandelion tea! Reminds me of falltime. Foraging for the roots. Pushing kids into mud-ruts. Songs for banishing badgers...!/[face:skeptical]Seems risky, a place like this, alone. Hard to imagine committing to it. And being [i]generous[], on top of it all.../Admirable. Being so willing to welcome us. Remember to ask what needs fixing, moving, or anything else we can help with./[face:skeptical]Make this with roasted dandelion roots, huh? Strange idea. Wonder if <npc2.mf:he's/she's/they've> got anything with a [i]kick[].../[face:grim]World needs people like <npc2.mf:him/her/them>. Someday, I hope, that'll be [i]all[] it needs. We'll be sitting home with wine, peace, and remembering./Times like these, I'd like owning a mill. But when the farmers bring their grain, that's the part I'd find taxing./Windmills of the world stand and hold their sailing arms to the seasons. An example for [i]us[], maybe. Meeting force with productivity./Could see a story like this...

~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc2=I'm fine. I'm happy for the company. Stories <hook2> here's told are already worth whatever hospitality I've given. But are you two still set on staying just the night?
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_narration=<hook> pulls out the poster <hook.mf:he/she/they>'d found pinned to a taverndoor in <town>.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_actionHuge=[dark]Think you're a hero? \nDreaming of glory?

That we're needed elsewhere./[face:happy]Can't really explain it. Just think\nwe're needed elsewhere./[face:grim]I'm needed elsewhere./[face:skeptical]I've just got this weird notion.\nLike I'm needed elsewhere.../Think we're needed elsewhere.>
