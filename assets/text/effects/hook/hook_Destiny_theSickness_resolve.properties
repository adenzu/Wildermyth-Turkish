~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The Gorgon dead and the <hook.bookish/healer/poet/snark:glasswork edifice/fume-throwing glass assemblage/strange spellshrine/glowing orb-thing> destroyed, for a moment they can only <hook.2nd/bookish/healer/poet/snark:look and ponder their deed/breathe clean air/stare at the twin wrecks/tongue dry mouths>, and hope this will be enough to stem the sickness.\n\n<hook.rfln.hook2:///--->
~01~~panel_002.(hook_and_hook2_are_rivals)~1_hook2=<hook2.coward/goofball/healer/leader/poet/snark:And now what? Can that really be it?/Alright, that went pretty smoothly. Which... is bizarre./I've certainly never heard of this working. I mean I've never heard of this at all./Well, I'll give it to you, <hook>. That took some courage./Will the weather inside sick bodies turn clear, like the air of this grove?/Wow, way to trust your instinct, <hook>. And of course, I do mean [b]instinct[], not fate.>
~01~~panel_003.(hook_and_hook2_are_friends)~1_hook2=<hook2.coward/goofball/healer/leader/poet/snark:We killed it, right? Is everything fine now? Hard to believe, I guess, but.../Well hollow me out and call me a whiskey-sack...!/For some reason, I feel like laughing!/Well, I'll give it to you, <hook>. That took some courage!/At least the stink is gone. Perhaps the gloom will be banished everywhere?/Alright, <hook>. Fate, or whatever it is. Seems like it worked out in this case!>
~01~~panel_004.(hook_and_hook2_are_lovers)~1_hook2=<hook2.coward/goofball/healer/leader/poet/snark:We're sure that's it? I mean, is there something else? More of them?/Well blow in my ear and tell me it's winter...! We did it?/If this really does work... I mean I've never heard of it before, and it strictly doesn't make sense, but.../Trusting you has always been my best decision, <hook>./You always find the way to go, <hook>. Even when no one sees a path./Alright, <hook>. Fate. [b]Whatever[] is working in your favor. Count me in.>
~01~~panel_005~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook.bookish/healer/poet/snark:How strange. It feels like when you finish a book, you snap the cover closed and hold it to your chest. It's like a firewarm stone. /If that [b]is[] it... Years of my life brooding. It seems like the weight is gone./The sky breathes, the trees are well. I do sense a [i]wholeness[] coming in around us./Yep, I guess that [b]must[] be it, huh <hook2>? The future is solved.>/<hook.bookish/healer/poet/snark:Do you feel that? It feels like when you finish a book, you snap the cover closed and hold it to your chest. It's a firewarm stone. /If that [b]is[] it... Years of my life brooding. It seems like the weight is gone./The sky breathes, the trees are well. I do sense a [i]wholeness[] coming in around us./Yep, I guess that [b]must[] be it, huh <hook2>? The future is solved.>/<hook.bookish/healer/poet/snark:This moment. It feels like when you finish a book, you snap the cover closed and hold it to your chest.

~01~~panel_018~1_hook=The sun begins to rise, and the world awakens. In the course of a few moments, the dark cloud of the Gorgon spell has blown apart, faded into memory. <hook> and <hook2> find no more reason to linger. They head home, where they will find the wasting illness that threatened to overwhelm their town has mysteriously vanished.
~01~~panel_019~1_hook=I don't know why. But I have the feeling something's over. That I don't know what's next.\n\n<hook.rfln.hook2:///--->
~01~~panel_023~1_hook=I've always had a... <hook.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark:a bewildering proof in my mind, knowledge of a higher meaning./a sometimes dreadful certainty about how things would turn out./the sense I was playing with a fixed deck. That I knew next card./the sense that all I gained was given to me for a reason./the knowledge I was put here to serve something bigger./the courage to rush in, knowing fate would handle the rest./a sense of clear purpose, a mission./a star I sailed by that nobody else saw./an insistent breath, blowing at my back, sending me forward./a proud yearning, a sense I was meant for something great./a quest or omen or something, pulling me on.> And sometimes I wished I didn't. But now <hook.2nd/bookish/coward/greedy/healer/hothead/loner/romantic:I understand. It's been my pillar./I'm kind of anxious. Is it gone?/I want it back./I realize I leaned on that./there's this... emptiness?/there's a... loneliness? Different than normal./I don't know. I'm a little cold inside.>\n\n<hook.rfln.hook2:///--->

~01~~panel_028~1_hook=<hook.leader.55:So I have to decide, I guess... I have to take charge, and.../So I mean... what do I [b]do[] now?>
~01~~panel_030~1_hook2=Look. <hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2.bookish/healer/leader/loner/poet/snark:I'm not sure who gives you your magic destiny. But you have to figure that, if you [b]are[] in the hands of fate, you probably won't be cast away after one [b]successful[] quest. Right?/I get it. Well, kind of. But remember? We're all doing this together. Even if you're a fool, you're at least a talented one. We're going to keep needing you./I understand you're used to having some kind of... I don't know, compass? The rest of us, we choose our own direction. And live with the surprises./Think of it as an excuse to just get away from things. That's what I'd do, at least. That can be nice, right?/Rains come without you wishing them to. Suns rise and fall. It's not about you at all. That might be hard to know, but it's also kind of comforting, right?/I don't know what your deal totally is, but a break can be nice. Why don't you just stop thinking and enjoy it?>/<hook2.goofball/healer/leader/loner/poet/snark:Probably the spirits of your ancestors will appear to you before season's end. Give you a new impending doom. Just enjoy the break while it lasts./Something always comes up. Just enjoy the rare moment you can say you're... what do you call it? Simply drifting./There's always another storm on the way. For a lot of us, we don't necessarily feel called, we just... you know. Take our rests between rains./Now you get to enjoy some quiet. Take that as your reward, because it's absolutely precious./Stillness is a mirror. You'll learn about yourself by gazing in its depths. But it soon shatters. A new day brings new weather./Don't worry. I'm sure you'll come up with a new undeniable destiny. And sooner than we all hope. But you can't rush fate, can you?>/<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/poet/romantic/snark:Trust me when I say that doing things without knowing exactly why, it drives me crazy too. But the best things are sometimes like that. For instance... love./I never know what's coming, and it's often terrifying. But surprises [b]can[] be nice... like when you fall in love with someone you once thought was a crazy babbling dope./We're just animals. Anything we do beyond snore through winter, scarf our food, and hawoo at each other is a miracle, right? Just enjoy it for a while. See what happens./Lots of us have no clue what we're supposed to do. Even when we wake up in time for breakfast, we struggle between eggs or fruit. Maybe it's time you got to see that side of it?/Most of us are moths chasing glimmers through darkness. We run risks, but we run them together. Think of it as... I don't know. Getting your wings. Joining the hunt./You've always surprised me, and I... I want to do the same for you. So I'm actually happy you feel this way. Let's go do something completely crazy./You'll probably have a new sacred destiny by dinnertime. But until then... this is how everyone else lives. So don't worry. We're all mostly doing okay.>/--->\n\n<hook.rfln.hook2:///--->
