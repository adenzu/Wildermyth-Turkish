.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> have arrived at <site>.
.longName=The Geometry of Magic
.name=Event
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Over generations, a modest compound has grown near <site>.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_hook=Some folks have come here to gain wisdom and strength, while others grew up \ninside its protection. It's a place of relative seclusion, inhabited by an order of \nknights focused on peacefully honing their bodies and minds to work in concert.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hook=<hook.healer/hothead/loner/60:Are we disturbing you?\nPlease, pardon us./[face:talking]Hey, you. You know how to use that <npc.weaponType>?/[face:grim]We don't want to disturb you./You from around here? Know about this place?>
~01~prompt~panel_003~5_hook2=<hook2.hothead/leader/loner/60:Pretty slow, I guess./Oh. Really?/Oh. You mean the daylight?/Oh. Alright.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~4_npc=<hook2.hothead/leader/loner/60:Do you know the slowness with which a blade of grass rises to match its cousins?/Every sword is three swords./Moment to moment, the sun's not the same. The world is cast new in each blade of light./If you wish to speak to the dead, you'll find it easy enough. If you wish to listen to them...! That's the real trick.>
~01~prompt~panel_005~4_npc=<hook2.hothead/leader/loner/60:Somewhat slow, right? But what are we expressing? In a way, we're only illuminating our own expectation of speed. Can this be any true measure of the slowness of grass?/There is the sword of intention, the sword you balance and swing, and the sword of consequence. When all three are aligned in purpose and decision... only then may your strike be true./Do I? Surely I could mean any flame, any beam out of the sky. Fire and light are manifestations of chaos, and it is from the glow and shadow of chaos that all understanding cascades onto our senses, or misses us entirely./I could talk to a butterfly, a blade of grass, an angled shadow in the corner. But to hear these things, to really attend to what they say or sing, I must assemble a codex within my own body for interpreting all I sense.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~5_npc=Want some nutbread?
~01~prompt~panel_007~6_hook=Yeah.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_narration=Without another word, <npc.mf:he turns/she turns/they turn> and leads them down a hillpath...
~01~prompt~panel_009~7_narration=...darkened and dappled by the sun-threaded cloudcover...
~01~prompt~panel_010~7_narration=...into a sparsely treed field, rolling greenstrewn land marked by low gentle walls.
~01~prompt~panel_011~8_npc=There it is. A nice nutloaf.
~01~prompt~panel_012~9_hook2=<hook2.poet.60:I do appreciate your solemnity and thoughtfulness... but I'm here for some kind of... Well,/Hey, listen, <hook> here convinced me we were going to do some kind of... Well,> there's apparently a group of philosopher-knights making their home around here? Is that you?
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook=Yeah.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_hook2=Uh.
~01~prompt~panel_014~10_npc=You mean the Warless Order?
~01~prompt~panel_015~10_npc=That [i]is[] us. You want training, then? I see. The wise seeker doesn't ask for bread, but for the skill of baking.
~01~prompt~panel_016.(hook_is_hothead)~1_npc=You really think you're worthy? To train with an ancient order of still quite youthful-looking knights?
~01~prompt~panel_017.(hook_is_romantic)~1_npc=Still... Are you prepared for how sweaty it gets?
~01~prompt~panel_018.(hook_is_snark)~1_npc=Is that really what you're planning on wearing, though?
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_hook=Yeah.
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_hook2=Nn...yes?
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_npc=Oh, alright. <hook.hothead/romantic/snark:It always works best with the worthy ones./We do our own laundry every day. It's part of being tough./Those are good training-outfits.>
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_npc=Well then, pleased to meet you. I'm <npc.fullname>. Bringing the thought-self and the meat-self together begins with your name. But it's only the beginning!
~01~prompt~panel_022~10_npc=Together, we'll make the metaphysical \nmuch less meta and a lot more physical.
~01~prompt~panel_023~2_narration=Over the next week, they train, eat, and sleep on a schedule.
~01~prompt~panel_023~3_narration=<npc>'s style is...
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~3_narration=+Health, +Speed
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~4_narration=Grueling and relentless.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~3_narration=+Accuracy, +Potency
~03~choice_no~panel_001~4_narration=Exploratory and unsteadying.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~1_hook=It's a week full of anvil lifts...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~2_hook=...table hops...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~2_hook=...and hog dodging.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~1_hook=Sunset approaches on their final day of training.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~1_hook=<npc> leads them into the closeness of a nearby wood.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~1_hook=<npc.mf:He halts/She halts/They halt>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~2_hook=The resinous air sparkles.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_007~1_npc=You have to understand. A body is magical, and magic is limitless. Observing you, I see you're restrained by your inability to access it: the geometry inside.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_008~1_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/poet/60:Geometries inside us. Hm. Interesting./[face:happy]Is that what I've got, all banging around in there?/You're speaking in metaphor?/When you say that...>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~2_hook2=Geometry?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~3_npc=The shape you make.\nYour muscles and bones.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_011~1_npc=What folks think of as magic, an ethereal energy, is present within your own inner alignment. You can channel and enact it through your body, if you're conscious and practiced enough. That is the meaning of uniting the thought-self and the meat-self. That makes you powerful.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_012~1_hook=<hook.whm:Well. But what about biceps? They're meaningless now?/Well, but how important would you say the core is? Shouldn't I blast it?/But shouldn't magic be from reading? You can't be magic AND muscular.>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_013~1_npc=<hook.whm:[face:surprised]Are you kidding? Biceps [i]definitely[] matter!/[face:interested]Oh, do! A well-sculpted core is [i]very[] attractive./>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_014~1_npc=Uh oh! Random encounter!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_014~2_narration=Out of a sudden shadowy knot of smoke comes an ambush!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~1_hook=It's a week full of \nexperimental astrologies...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~2_hook=...prolonged discomfort...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~2_hook=...and the recalibration\nof sense and reflex.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~1_hook=Sunset approaches on their final day of training.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~1_hook=<npc> leads them into the closeness of a nearby wood.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~1_hook=<npc.mf:He halts/She halts/They halt>.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~2_hook=The resinous air sparkles.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~1_npc=Exertion is that way by which body and mind are exhausted, and from exhaustion springs growth. Exerting mind and body together, we access the geometry inside ourselves.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~1_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/poet/60:Geometries inside us. Hm. Interesting./[face:happy]Is that what I've got, all banging around in there?/You're speaking in metaphor?/When you say that...>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~2_hook2=Geometry?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_010~3_npc=The shape you make, your\nspirit, meat, and bones.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_011~1_npc=Didn't you know that's the basis for magic? It's not an ethereal energy, it's present in the alignment of every physical thing. You can channel and direct it, if you're conscious and practiced enough. Sensing and manipulating that geometry makes you powerful.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_012~1_hook=<hook.whm:Well. But what about biceps? They're meaningless now?/Well, but how important would you say the core is? Shouldn't I blast it?/But shouldn't magic be from reading? You can't be magic AND muscular.>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_013~1_npc=<hook.whm:[face:surprised]Are you kidding? Biceps [i]definitely[] matter!/[face:interested]Oh, do! A well-sculpted core is [i]very[] attractive./>
