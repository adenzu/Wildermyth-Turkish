.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> resolved the issue.
.longName=The Geometry of Magic
.name=Result
~01~~panel_001~1_hook=Where did they come from?
~01~~panel_001~2_hook2=Were we betrayed?
~01~~panel_002~1_npc3=No, no, that was just <npc> and <npc2>! Stand up, you rascals!
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=The ostensibly dead cultists rise sheepishly to their feet and tug off their disguises...
~01~~panel_004~1_npc=Hi, <hook.mf:<hook2.mf:fellas/there/there>/<hook2.mf:there/ladies/there>/there>!
~01~~panel_004~2_npc2=<npc3>, take it seriously!
~01~~panel_005~1_legend=This <npc.mf:cool guy/cool lady/cool person>'s <npc> and that <npc2.mf:soggy vindictive ogre/ploppy humorless ogre/ploppy humorless ogre> is <npc2>. Think of it as a final test. An easy one, perhaps, given your abilities. But one you've certainly passed.
~01~~panel_007~2_npc2=I prefer to think of it as philosophical knighting...
~01~~panel_008~1_npc=I guess we'll go back to our knightly philosophizing!
~01~~panel_010~5_npc3=Am I right? Phew, I'm glad they're gone.
~01~~panel_011~5_npc3=But anyway. What was I saying about enlightenment?
~01~~panel_012~1_npc3=Ah, yes. Surpassing our limits always takes a refiguring. \nWe're redrawing the lines inside ourselves...
~01~~panel_013~1_npc3=If we do it with carefulness and wisdom, the new shapes inside us grow more aligned. To the Geometry of Magic. The Geometry of All Things.
~01~~panel_014~2_narration=They leave the woods, a small silent procession.
~01~~panel_015~1_hook=Bidding their instructor farewell...
~01~~panel_015~2_hook=...they embark on a journey across the night.
~01~~panel_016~2_hook=They walk long enough that all the stars have sprouted.
~01~~panel_017~3_hook=<hook.personality:Hm. I have esteem for old math of course. Perhaps it's our error, that we divide these things: arithmetic and art, study and dance, medicine and magic./It's hard to keep simple focus on things. Let alone whatever [i]<npc.mf:he/she/they>[] meant. This arcane awareness. Fundamental shapes. When it's life or death? I don't know./So which shape is best? Does triangle always win? And what am I? I'd like to say I've got some hard lines, <hook.mf:but I'm [i]definitely[] huggable./but the right curves, too./but I'm [i]definitely[] huggable.>/It's interesting. I've always seen things as very cause and effect. Chaotic, in how they play out, but easy to understand, taken event by event. Maybe it's related to that, but I don't know. The order of things./It's strange. Flesh, blood, muscle. These are base things, not magical. But they bind themselves together when they break. They [i]know[] their proper forms, and work by nature to assume them. Hm./It makes no sense, of course. But this kind of talk rarely does. I'll let it be. I think my own muscles know better than I do./We all have to trust in something besides ourselves. Could that thing be...? I don't know. I prefer looking for it in others. In the heat of a moment, we might lose our shape. Or our reason fails. All we have then is friends./It makes a little sense to me. When you're by yourself, breathing, clear-headed. When you close your eyes. Shapes [i]do[] form. Hm.../It's like learning a new language, maybe. Never a single summit. Fluency improves by dawns and delays. You train towards naturalness./I think about how two lovers find some sort of physical oneness... and maybe I'm just crude. But there is an essential geometry, at the primitive level, isn't there?/I don't know, really. Part of me wants to believe it, and part of me thinks it's another false trail. Nothing can explain everything. You know?> Anyway. We got some good exercise in.
~01~~panel_018~4_hook2=<hook2.whm:There's [i]something[] in our movements. When I've mastered a skill or a motion, that's when I've felt it. Some call it grace. Think it's that simple?/You sense [i]something[], looking at the figures of trees. Trunks, boughs, patterns. My body recognizes it. Molds to it, when I walk unseen. I wonder if it's the same./There's always [i]been[] that place inside. From which I reach out, and at which the invisible arms of the world can reach me. But to think of it as something physical... I don't know.>
~01~~panel_019~1_hook=Mist takes form.
~01~~panel_020~1_hook=But they keep marching...
~01~~panel_021~1_hook=...to the verge of dawn.
~01~~panel_022~6_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]Surprised, I guess. But glad you dragged me off my drinking-stool./Thinking back... I'm glad you dragged me out of that tavern./Thanks for dragging me out here, love. Off my drinking-stool./-->
~01~~panel_022~7_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]//[face:happy]/-->So return the favor and drag me back [i]to[] it.
