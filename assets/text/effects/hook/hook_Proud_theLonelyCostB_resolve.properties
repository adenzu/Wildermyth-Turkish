~01~~panel_060~6_hook2=<legend>, [i]what...[] did you just [i]do...?[]
~01~~panel_061~5_legend=[light]It's wonderful news! You need no more call me <legend.fullname>!\nI will never need to wear so coarse a name again!

~01~~panel_063~1_legend=[light]Oh, but you were so [i]easily[] fooled, I might even believe you had \ndesired this! Does the spirit of my servant reside in you?\nNo, for I would've certainly felt it, I'd say. When you were young.
~01~~panel_064~8_legend=[light]But how pleasing that you will finally understand.
~01~~panel_065~7_hook2=[i]Yours...[] is the voice...
~01~~panel_066~3_narration=How many times, on a night of no moon, had <hook2> woken with a murmur in <hook2.mf:his/her/their> ear? The whispering of an absent <legend.mf:man/woman/person>'s lips.

~01~~panel_070~8_hook2=[small]Mm.

~01~~panel_079~12_hook2=It does.
~01~~panel_081~11_hook=I'm sure it's... we'll find a way to\nundo... whatever we did.
