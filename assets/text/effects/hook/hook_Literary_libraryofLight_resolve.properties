~01~~panel_002~2_hook=<hook2.bookish/romantic/snark:Is that a good sign?/<hook.rfln.hook2:Got it. I'll mark it on this stone.

~01~~panel_004~1_hook=Oh!
~01~~panel_005~1_hook=<legend.fullname> rather famously recorded that there were two ways a traveler would be able to locate <legend.mf:his/her/their> library.
~01~~panel_006~1_hook2=<hook.coward/healer/goofball/poet:Mm, right. A lot of [i]O's[]./That's not very helpful./<hook2.snark.60:Sure, or like  Poop Mountain./A mountain made of bacon? Good.>/Right, good, so the standard gibberish.> What's the second way?
~01~~panel_007~1_hook=<hook.coward/healer/goofball/poet:There was <legend.mf:his/her/their> line: "Fools fear the wise, and the wise fear fools." Which, I heard if you rearrange the letters, it gives you a clue. I could never unscramble it./The first way would be that it might appear to them when they most needed knowledge. "For if knowledge alone were what they sought, a star might guide them, shining even by day."/One is you turn yourself into a vaguerbeast, the creature who so loves to devour lies. That many books would give off a great ripe aroma like a... I don't know. Mount Bacon./There's <legend.mf:his/her/their> saying: "Ever a north-pointing compass tells you its own truth. Ever a stranger tells you hers and an enemy someone else's. But ever a good friend lies.">
~01~~panel_008~1_hook=Just how big it is!
~01~~panel_009~1_hook=[small]<hook.healer/hothead/poet:The air is so fresh, \nbut so old.../Careful what you touch.\nIt's all precious./Look at the carvings on \nthe wood...>[]
~01~~panel_009~2_narration=The interior of the library is a symphony of sunlight playing for a frozen ballet of crammed shelves.
~01~~panel_009~3_narration=Every space is crowded with volumes...
~01~~panel_010~1_hook2=<hook2.bookish/coward/greedy/loner/poet/romantic/snark:Those beams are the size of redwoods.../Don't get lost. We'll never find our way out./How do you begin to pay for all of it...?/Could get lost forever in here.../Where old words gather, young hearts bloom./<hook.rfln.hook2:I can see why this place called to you.../Takes your breath, doesn't it?/This counts as your birthday present, right?/--->/This is impossible...>
~01~~panel_011~1_hook=<hook.snark.60:I never thought I'd have this feeling... I'm doubting my own eyes. Worried I'm dreaming./This is what dreams look like...>
~01~~panel_011~2_hook2=Could you even dream this?
~01~~panel_013~1_thought=[white]The library was a dream. That's how it began.
~01~~panel_013~2_thought=[white]Why I studied magic all my life? Same as every magician!
~01~~panel_013~3_hook2=[white]I wanted to make my dreams real.
~01~~panel_014~2_thought=[white]I didn't understand, then.
~01~~panel_015~1_hook=[white]When dreams come true, <hook.coward/greedy/healer/leader/loner/romantic/snark:you become more clutching, not less./you miss dreaming them./people have a way of turning inward./the burden is on you to let them go./you may find yourself buried in them./the heart that was soft for seeds.../the dreamer loses purpose.>
~01~~panel_015~2_thought=[white]<hook.coward/greedy/healer/leader/loner/romantic/snark:You fear sleeping./Satisfaction lasts a while.../It's hard not to curl around.../No dream nests one place for long./More than ever, you begin.../...hardens against anything.../Or <hook.mf:he begins/she begins/they begin> to dream of other things.>
~01~~panel_015~3_thought=[white]<hook.coward/greedy/healer/leader/loner/romantic/snark:Because you fear waking up./...but ever breeds its opposite./...the thing you most wanted./Enjoy it. Release it. Journey on./...to long for sleep./...that might awaken it./Just ask my <hook.mf:husband./wife./partner.>>
~01~~panel_016~1_legend=[white]The library was a dream. And that's what it must remain.
~01~~panel_017~1_legend=[white]Those who leave it...
~01~~panel_018~1_legend=[white]...will never find their way back.
~01~~panel_020~1_hook2=<hook>?
~01~~panel_020~2_narration=Many days later...
~01~~panel_021~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Don't be stubborn, you old.../No, we need to leave./Wow, you took that really well./--->
~01~~panel_022~1_hook=We need to leave, <hook2>.
~01~~panel_023~1_hook2=Oh...
~01~~panel_024~1_hook2=Urm...
~01~~panel_025~1_hook=Something I realized, I guess. I'm not sure when.
~01~~panel_026~1_hook=<hook.leader.60:Maybe it was when I thought of this journey we authored together. In fact all of it. Not just this journey, but the many others./A long time ago, maybe. Grand times I've spent with books. Times I was alone with a novel and a window and a rainstorm...>
~01~~panel_027~1_hook=I'm glad we came here. Glad we found it. Saw it all.
~01~~panel_029~1_hook=I've always been afraid to write my own stories. Afraid they'd end up nowhere, and matter to no one.
~01~~panel_030~2_hook=But I think that could be the next dream for me.
~01~~panel_031~1_hook2=<hook>? What if you can't go back?
~01~~panel_034~1_hook2=In stories, isn't that the rule? That you can only visit it once?
~01~~panel_036~2_hook=You know... I've been reading since I was small.\nBooks by heroes and half-crazies. Fiction of all \nkind and quality. What I'm thinking now, is...
~01~~panel_037~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:happy]/>
~01~~panel_037~3_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:talking]/[face:happy]/[face:joy]/>It's time I start putting life into my own words.
