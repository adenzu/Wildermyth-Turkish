.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> resolved the issue.
.longName=Needed Elsewhere
.name=Result
~01~~panel_001~1_npc2=Farmers coming? Naw, no cart.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=A long week later, on a windless afternoon...
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=<npc2> the millkeeper squints as distant shadows resolve into shapes, some familiar, some not.
~01~~panel_003~1_npc2=Back with visitors? They'd love if I broke out the beer, I expect.
~01~~panel_004~1_npc2=And why wouldn't I?
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=<hook> and <hook2> bring the young <npc4> and <npc4.mf:his/her/their> <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling>, <npc3>, into the millkeeper's home. They drink, and talk about what may lie ahead.
~01~~panel_005~3_narration=It's good having the sky off them.
~01~~panel_005~4_narration=It's good smelling dry buildingstones and fresh flour.
~01~~panel_006~3_npc4=<npc3>, you [i]sure[]? Why don't you come with me?
~01~~panel_007~3_npc3=Be a what? Justice-fighter? Monster-slayer? Naw. I'm good.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=Explaining <npc4.mf:his/her/their> decision to <npc4.mf:his/her/their> older <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling>, <npc4> convinced <npc3> to come along the road. At least until it was safe to split.
~01~~panel_009~3_npc3=Got our old lodge waiting for me, now. I'll sweep the spiders out. Honestly, it'll be good knowing you're where you belong. I never had the... but wouldn't have felt good, either, isolating you. That's what [i]I[] want. My own time and solitude.
~01~~panel_010~3_npc3=And hey... that armor [i]suits[] you. You'll do well.
~01~~panel_011~4_npc2=Got potatoes and market sausage frying up.
~01~~panel_012~5_hook2=You're doing too much.
~01~~panel_012~6_hook=Thanks, but...
~01~~panel_013~1_npc2=All you've told me, and all I can divine about you... You'll always be needed elsewhere; good folks are needed everywhere. I only help. I can clearly afford it.
~01~~panel_014~1_npc2=Oh, the...!
~01~~panel_014~2_action=POP!!
~01~~panel_014~3_narration=The food in the pan complains. \n<npc2> scoots back to <npc2.mf:his/her/their> kitchen.
~01~~panel_015~2_narration=<npc3> sets down <npc3.mf:his/her/their> cup, slipping from the fireside and opening the door.
~01~~panel_016~1_npc3=I'll avoid that meal, if none of you mind. \nDon't like ground meat.
~01~~panel_017~1_npc4=Yeah, you... <npc3>..?
~01~~panel_018~1_npc4=I'll... at least see <npc3.mf:him/her/them> on <npc3.mf:his/her/their> way, I guess. Sorry.
~01~~panel_018~2_hook=It's fine. Take your time.
~01~~panel_019~1_action=[tan]thmp!
~01~~panel_021~2_hook=What's wrinkling [i]you[]?
~01~~panel_022~2_hook2=Said you were leaving the company. For good. Guess that's still got me thinking.
~01~~panel_023~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Really didn't expect to be coming back./I was talking about starting fresh, \nwasn't I? Some other place?/Would you have gone with me? If... I mean, at this point it would be.../==>
~01~~panel_024~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]Yeah? I was going to ask, but I also didn't want to./[face:interested]Decided against it, though?/You're [i]not[] planning on going away now, are you?/==>
~01~~panel_025~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:neutral]You [i]went[]. Now you're coming back. Wasn't like you found anything worth staying for./[face:neutral]It's your old thing, I know. They call it roamingwant. Travel-longing. Or also.../[face:interested]I know, love. It's your traveling heart. \nAnd yes. I'd stay with you./==>
~01~~panel_025~2_hook=I was going [i]somewhere[], I thought. But really, I just wanted to go anywhere. Anywhere new. It's my...
~01~~panel_026~4_npc2=Any of you not like pepper?\nOh, oops. Did they leave?
~01~~panel_026~5_hook2=Stepped outside.
~01~~panel_026~6_hook=Seems like one plate less, though.
~01~~panel_027~4_npc2=Hm.
~01~~panel_028~1_npc2=You know, I grew up in a hard place. People that'd steal whatever they thought they could. Why do you think I ended up out here? There's those sorts, all over.
~01~~panel_029~4_npc2=Don't take it for granted, having a place to come home to. Having a community you've got faith in. That's what those people are missing.
~01~~panel_030~3_npc4=Sorry, I...
~01~~panel_031~1_action=[tan][actionSmall]thmp
~01~~panel_031~2_npc4=Oh. Yeah. Sorry, <npc3> says thanks for everything. \nThink <npc3.mf:he/she/they> felt guilty. Like <npc3.mf:he/she/they> didn't deserve to stay.
~01~~panel_032~4_npc2=Hm. Well, <npc3.mf:he probably knows/she probably knows/they probably know> better than we do, if that's true.\nI'll go finish up. Be another while to get things crispy.
~01~~panel_033~1_narration=They stand around in thoughtful quiet. The sounds and smells of the millkeeper's cooking are impossible to ignore.
~01~~panel_033~2_narration=Stomachs roar. <hook2> plops a new log on the fire.
~01~~panel_034~2_narration=<hook> unrolls the poster that pulled <hook.mf:him/her/them> across the world.\nThough creased and stained, old ink still gleams in the firelight.
~01~~panel_035~1_hook=If we're lucky, none of us'll ever see <legend.fullname> again. Or <legend.mf:his/her/their> lackey. But if we do...
~01~~panel_035~2_narration=<hook.mf:He wads/She wads/They wad> the paper into a ball...
~01~~panel_035~3_action=[actionSmall]...crmple...
~01~~panel_036~2_action=[actionSmall][brown]fwsh
~01~~panel_036~3_narration=...and <hook.mf:flicks/flicks/flick> it into the flames.
~01~~panel_037~1_hook=Anyway... <hook.coward/goofball/healer/poet/romantic/80:[face:interested]Being honest, <legend> doesn't come close. Not to the scariest things [i]we've[] stood in front of. Just hope you're ready. I know [i]I[] wasn't.../[face:happy]We've had a lot of serious talks, I guess. A lot of pondering and blathering and bleating over what we [i]ought[] to do. Just have fun, <npc4>. Enjoy the ride. You only get to be a hero once./[face:happy]You're going to be alright, <npc4>. I see it in your face. You stretch forward, you seek better things. But you hold onto what matters, in your heart. Yeah. You'll [i]need[] to be brave. But you'll be alright./Suns and moons go by in our lives. We'll never remember them all. The only moment you need to be a hero? It's the moment that opens in front of you. Keep thinking that. Living it. And you'll be alright./[face:happy]World's full of wonders and endless yonderings. Monsters, magic, foul weather and fine. Beauties and heartbreakers. Being a hero means you reach for them all. Welcome to the fold./It's more fearsome things than <legend>, out there. \nThat's the test that awaits you. Hope you can handle it.>
