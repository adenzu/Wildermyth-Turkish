~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook2=Hm.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=Fog descends sometime after dark. It casts an unhealthy shade over everything.

~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook=<hook.greedy/healer/poet/snark:The sooner we deal with it, the sooner it can stop weighing on my heart./The sooner we stop it, the less people will suffer./I can't put it into words quite perfectly. I just know it has to be this way. The knowledge lives in my blood./What, you think bad hearts are stronger at night for some reason?> Really, I don't think it's my choice at all...

~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=As they approach <site>, an unfamiliar odor comes to them. Chemical and thick, coating the insides of their cheeks, turning mealy in their mouths.

Nightmare is the word I'd use./Yeah, someone built an evil stink-fountain in the woods./There's a ghostly allure to that odd glow it gives./Something evil./Yes. The unearthliest of things. The poisoned tooth pumping evil into our world./All creatures who craft are creatures who desire.> It's clearly not here for any friendly purpose.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook=Look inside that sphere.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_speech=You can see our town. Suffering.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/healer/hothead/leader/poet/snark:I'd say we should figure out what destroying it would do, but... no. There's little time, and little choice./I think we have to destroy it. Though I'm not sure what effect it'll have./The only thing I can see to do... is destroy it. My gut tells me that's right./I've always been the kind to kick the anthill./We must destroy it. That's why we were brought here./To destroy the destroyer is what all meek must learn to do, or succumb./Kind of obvious, I guess, but... let's knock it to pieces.>

~01~prompt~panel_019~2_narration=As they move to destroy the strange edifice, a hiss slices the air at their backs...
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_hook2=<hook2.snark/leader/poet:Big surprise, I guess. It's guarded./We have to move fast./The motherbird guards her nest.>
