~01~~panel_011.(hook2_is_goofball)~1_hook2=It calls me master...
~01~~panel_012.(hook2_is_greedy)~1_hook2=Hey, I think this thing could be useful.
~01~~panel_013.(hook2_is_loner)~1_hook2=I really hope you don't mean to keep this thing around.
~01~~panel_014.(hook2_is_poet)~1_hook2=This thing gives me an odd feeling. A sad feeling.
~01~~panel_016.(hook2_is_goofball)~1_hook2=It's kind of cute.

After I put my own body on the line?/If you'll recall, [i]dear <hook2>[], it's my flesh and marrow inside that thing./--->
~01~~panel_021.(hook2_is_goofball)~1_hook2=Well, but what's our other choice? You want Gary Deepist to have him?
~01~~panel_022.(hook2_is_greedy)~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]If me and my severed arm are useful to [i]you[] \nthen it was all worth it.../How long do you expect it to last? I don't know much about them... it must eventually run down, though, right?/<hook2>, it's an abomination. I mean yeah, it dug us out of here, but the thing's got my blood in it.../--->
~01~~panel_023.(hook2_is_greedy)~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Yeah, yeah. But now it's done, better to not waste it, right?/Until it does, why not see what it can do?/So you're saying it's like your child?/--->
~01~~panel_024.(hook2_is_loner)~1_hook=<hook.goofball/snark/romantic/60:[face:joy]Well, yeah! Soon I'll have a whole army of these little suckers. They'll carry me place to place, an imperious torso with a grinning head./[face:joke]Will it bother you if I do?/The thing has my own blood in it, my own tissue. It's basically my child. You want me to abandon my child?/It may not have cost and arm [i]and[] a leg, but an arm was enough.>
~01~~panel_025.(hook2_is_loner)~1_hook2=[face:grim]Be serious.
~01~~panel_026.(hook2_is_poet)~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Anyway, no matter what we might feel, we have a responsiblity now./But it's already served us once. Sometimes all the monster needs is a chance./But... perhaps we'll be able to turn this all to a good purpose? Shouldn't we try?/--->
~01~~panel_027.(hook2_is_poet)~1_hook2=I agree, <hook.rfln.hook2:for once./though I can't say I find the concept comforting./love. As long as you're okay.../--->
~01~~panel_028~1_hook=<hook2.goofball/greedy/loner/poet:[face:interested]I don't know. I'd put money on it either breaking down, or killing us in our sleep. But you're right./[face:skeptical]Sure, I don't know. Let's take it with us./[face:skeptical]I mean, yeah... And I guess maybe it kills us in our sleep, huh? But.../We may come to regret it, I guess.
