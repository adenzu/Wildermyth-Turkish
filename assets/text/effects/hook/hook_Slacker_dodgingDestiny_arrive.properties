~01~prompt~panel_017~7_npc2=Best I can tell, they're roamers from the west.
~01~prompt~panel_017~8_hook2=Brigands? That what they're called out here?
~01~prompt~panel_018~6_npc2=Came in and won't leave. Drinking us dry, eating all we can supply. My poor <npc.mf:brother/sister/sibling>'s serving them, getting all kinds of mistreatment and abuse. I ran to look for help.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_npc2=And... well. What about you folks? You pry those brigands out, we'd reward you the best we could.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_hook2=[gray]Opposite of where we're headed.
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_hook=[gray]And we've been gone a long time already.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_npc2=Maybe a week's travel south, is all it is. That's not so far. I can cook, though I don't have much food left on me.
~01~prompt~panel_022~7_hook=[gray][face:dubious]Never seem able to leave the work behind.

~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_hook=Let's get it over with, then. South we go, the enders of all brigandry.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_hook=Not this time. Sorry.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_narration=The road south is vacant, the glowing fields stretch forever.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~2_narration=Hunting yields hillfowl, foraging rewards them with wild peppers.

~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_narration=<npc.mf:He climbs/She climbs/They climb> nervously into the room.

~04~player_chose_one~panel_014~4_monster=Maybe I'll explain. See, we've got a thing going. I'm <monster>, I run things. We're good people. <npc3> tells stories. <npc4>'ll cook and sew.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_015~5_monster=We live the easy life, me and my crew. Place like this lasts us a few months. We can kind of hop from one to the next.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_016~6_monster=And you know what? We always could use more strong hands. You in? \nI'll grab some cups. We'll toast to the weak ones who set our table!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_017~5_hook=<hook.personality:Your operation is simplistic and unsustainable. Honestly surprises me you haven't lost some limbs, doing that kind of thing.

You clear out, or we make you. Got it?/I was born into this world with a love for living. And a love for living things. But when I see maggots like you, scrounging in a wound... it's disgusting, I'll say [i]that[]. Clear out of here. If you value your maggot life./Soup, too. Get me and <hook2> some soup.
