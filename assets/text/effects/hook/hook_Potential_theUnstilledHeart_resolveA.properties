~01~~panel_001~4_hook=<hook.coward/goofball/60:[face:interested]Think there's more of them?/[face:skeptical]Kind of random. Kind of weird./[face:interested]I'm surprised they tried that.>
~01~~panel_001~5_hook2=<hook2.bookish/coward/leader/60:[face:skeptical]Strange behavior. They didn't gauge \nour strength well at all, did they?/Let's get our mushrooms and go. \nQuicker the better./Let's get what we came for. \nNo reason to linger.[face:grim]/They might've been scouts. \nLet's not waste time.[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=They collect the gweldercaps and set out again for the smith's house.
~01~~panel_002~6_hook=You know, if we were ordinary folks foraging the woods, we'd most likely have died back there.
~01~~panel_003~8_hook2=<hook2.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:Yeah... I mean, [i]I[] don't feel safe, and I'm actually capable of defending myself. Can only guess how anyone else gets to sleep./[face:happy]That's a weird thing to think about. If we were ordinary folks, I doubt we'd be out here at all./Suppose that's true. But we [i]were[] ordinary folks, once. We were willing to work and become more./[face:grim]Makes you want to go find more of those rat-lizards, doesn't it? Teach [i]them[] a lesson in fear.../[face:grim]I keep that in mind, when I question my path. There's things and places in the world that [i]ordinary[] folks will never see./What's your point? That's why ordinary folks don't go foraging the woods in twos or threes. Not this deep, anyway./[face:grim]That's why what we're doing is important. These are dangerous lands, dangerous times. Few can afford to be meek or poorly armed.>
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=A roaring forge welcomes them back.
~01~~panel_004~4_npc=Let's see your haul!
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=That night, the <npc.mf:man/woman/person> sautees these rare mushrooms in butter and garlic. \nThe whole house fills with the aroma, first acrid, then nutty.
~01~~panel_005~5_npc=There's truly nothing better!
~01~~panel_006~5_npc=Cooking them does make them easier on the tummy. In case you were worried about sleeping in close quarters.
~01~~panel_007~4_narration=Soon enough, the work is done. <hook> and <hook2> bid the smith farewell, and go on their way with new weapons in tow.
~01~~panel_009~5_hook2=Don't tell me you're thinking about the stars again...
~01~~panel_009~6_hook=Hm?
~01~~panel_010~6_hook=No.
~01~~panel_011~6_hook=Thinking about my friends. <hook.loner/snark/60:[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]/>
~01~~panel_012~1_hook2=<hook.loner/snark/60:[i]You[] are? Your friends?/[face:skeptical]Oh. Uh, really?/That's... alright, why?>
~01~~panel_013~6_hook=Just that... for a long time I felt like there was something expected of me. A lot of it came from my own thing. My vision of the... Anyway. I was supposed to make some kind of [i]breakthrough[], one day. I thought. Have a moment of truth.
~01~~panel_014~7_hook=But it's [i]never[] like that, is it? Changes aren't so sudden in people.
~01~~panel_015~2_hook2=<hook2.personality:[face:interested]Our impulse is to think of our lives as arcs. As narratives./[face:interested]And you were afraid it would never happen? I get it./[face:happy]A moment of truth...!?/[face:skeptical]That would be nice./[face:interested]Alright. Well, don't give up. You still might./[face:skeptical]Where you just magically turn into a perfect version of yourself. Yeah./[face:interested]Well, you know. We always want to be our best. And get better./That's the lie we get told./That out-of-body, transcendent experience that will send us on the right path./[face:interested]Well, sure. That makes sense. Heroes in stories reach a turning point./[face:dubious]Define moment of truth.>
~01~~panel_016~6_hook=And growth's not for us to accomplish alone. So I'm glad for my friends. Helped me become what I was supposed to become. Walked with me, guarded my life, taught me when they could, and accepted my own correction. Learned with me.
~01~~panel_017~6_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook.loner/snark/60:[face:interested]It's weird saying so, of course. But anyway. Thank you, too./[face:interested]And I suppose I even mean... you, <hook2>. Thank you./Even you, <hook2>. I'm grateful.>/<hook.loner/snark/60:[face:interested]So I... wow, this is weird, isn't it? Thanks, is all I'm trying to say./[face:interested]So I... wow, this is weird, isn't it? Thanks, is all I'm trying to say./So... thank you.>/<hook.loner/snark/60:[face:sad]Sorry, I sound so... anyway, I was thinking about that. And, uh... thank [i]you[], most of all./[face:scared]Oh no, I sound way too cute, don't I? All I mean is thank you. Thank [i]you[] most of all./You most of all, <hook2>... You're the reason I can't fail. So thank you.>/-->
~01~~panel_018~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]How generous./<hook.loner/snark/60:[face:interested]That's it? Well, you're welcome./[face:interested]Can you put it in writing? I want to show everyone./[face:happy]Don't mention it.>/<hook.loner/snark/60:[face:joy]Oh, love... It's my joy, being by you. [i]I'm[] grateful./[face:joke]I wonder if I'll ever hear you sound so sincere again. Adorable./[face:dubious]You can still fail, darling. Don't get [i]too[] comfortable.>/-->

~01~~panel_020~4_narration=Their return to <town> is looked for, and warmly celebrated.
~01~~panel_020~5_narration=The gear they bring will help inspire uncertain hearts to action.
