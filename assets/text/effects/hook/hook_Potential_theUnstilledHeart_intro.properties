~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook2=See what I mean? <hook2.personality:The standard has to rise with \nthe resources and methodologies at our disposal./Not trying to give anyone a hard time,\nbut if [i]I[] had to use one of these... I'd drop it and run. [face:interested]/These weapons could probably \nscatter a dinner-salad. Not much else.[face:joy]/My eye is thoroughly [i]un[]caught. By any of it./[face:talking]We ask too much. Courage can't cut hides, \nand wisdom can't turn blades./[face:angry]Most of it's garbage. Worse \nthan useless because it takes up space!/We're who people look to. But it's also on us to bring people up, to give them the ability and the tools to fight on their own./And I know, I don't want a crowd of hopefuls. \nBut this little collection's kind of sad.../If you were growing grapes, you'd want to provide a trellis. For a crop of young heroes, you'd probably provide some decent weaponry.../For young dreamers, would-be heroes, an attractive weapon means a lot. It helps them imagine more. Their story, their [i]legacy[] someday./These are scarecrow weapons. Honestly, \na [i]crow[] would probably laugh at most of them.>
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Well.../You know, <hook2>.../[face:talking]Love, listen.../-->
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:...I actually agree./...you might be right./...you're right.[face:happy]/-->
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=<company> keep a storeroom full of used, cast-off, and recovered equipment.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_narration=It's what they assign to new members and volunteers.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook=[face:interested]Not an inspiring assortment at all.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:talking]Even if we do agree, what's the remedy?\nDig holes and hope for treasure?/[face:talking]So you think we can enlist some help?\nAnd you know where to find it?/So this <npc.mf:man/woman/person>, this smith... \nCan we find <npc.mf:him/her/them>?/-->
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]/[face:interested]/[face:neutral]/-->
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]That sounds like one of your ideas. No, that's why I'm saying we find this <npc.mf:man/woman/person>. This smith./[face:interested]The <npc.mf:man/woman/person> I have in mind is famous enough./[face:talking]I doubt it'll be much trouble./-->
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook2=<npc.fullname> keeps mostly to <npc.mf:himself/herself/themself>, sure. But you're not a famous bladesmith if no one knows where you are. Certainly the metal merchants know.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook2=<hook2.greedy/hothead/loner/60:[face:skeptical]Plus... I bet <npc.mf:he/she/they>'d at least give [i]our[] gear a going over./If a reputation means anything these days, then <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> exactly who we need./I don't know. May be a waste of time. People don't often live up to what's said about them. Still.../[face:skeptical]If you need blades, a bladesmith's who you ask. Am I wrong?>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hook=Thinking back to my first battle... <hook.whm:no techniques, no experience, no armor or even a real weapon/clumsy feet, no armor, little actual skill and not even a real weapon/no knowledge of the magic I could wield, no armor, no real weapon>... how did I find the nerve?
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]/[face:interested]/[face:happy]/-->
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:talking]/[face:happy]/-->Leave tomorrow and we'll be back all the sooner.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:interested]/[face:happy]/[face:joy]/-->
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]/[face:joke]/-->I hope we've sorted out how we're paying for this...?
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~3_narration=Embark.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=[face:skeptical]Hmm... is it that urgent?
~03~choice_no~panel_001~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:angry]/[face:grim]/[face:sad]/-->
~03~choice_no~panel_001~4_narration=Delay.
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
