~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.coward/loner/romantic/snark/60:I wanted the wisdom to release my fears. But they burned like blue flame, they roared out of depths to claim me./All I hoped for was some peace and quiet, you know? Live my own way and place. But always I wind up among <hook.whm:warriors, and start wandering/rogues, and start roaming/thinkers, and start thinking>. The baleful flame continues to writhe.../In my heart, I hoped only for love. Since I was little I dreamed of weddings. But the blue flame called me, and some fragment of my twisted soul called back.../You can guess can't you? I'm about to say something drifty, dreamy, dramatic. That's what's great about blue fire is it sets a spooky whatever. Atmos-thing./Since I was very small, one dream has returned to me again and again. Blue fire threads the darkness, heat and terror.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:It does me little good to tell you, <hook2>./I know I've spoken of it before, <hook2>./<hook2>, you remember. Those times I've woken in a burning sweat./--->
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_speech=I have nightmares that curl my soul. Of a place I've never been.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_speech=A torched house, the blue blaze eating bones. I feel dread.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2.snark.60:I have nightmares about you telling me about your nightmares. My dreams must be prophetic.../You're standing really close to that fire.>/<hook2.snark.60:Have you said that? Are you sure you weren't speaking to a different <hook2>?/And being you, you take those dreams ultra-seriously, I imagine.>/<hook2.snark.60:At least you're not dreaming of other <hook2.mf:guys/women/romances>?/I do worry about it, but...>/--->
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2.snark.60:You make me laugh. All the time./I'm imagining it blue, [i]<hook2>[]. It's easier,[i] <hook2>[], if I stand close.>/<hook2.snark.60:Are you being funny?/Well. I mean. Why are we here?>/<hook2.snark.60:Oh. What? No I don't!/But what? It's not serious?>/--->
~01~prompt~panel_007.(hook_and_hook2_are_rivals).(hook2_is_snark_>_60)~1_hook2=I know. I crack my own self up too. Almost constantly.
~01~prompt~panel_008.(hook_and_hook2_are_rivals).(hook2_NOT_snark)~1_hook2=Oh, so you're not considering roasting a bird? Cause I can [i]get[] a bird. It's not hard. Do you care what kind?
~01~prompt~panel_009.(hook_and_hook2_are_friends).(hook2_is_snark_>_60)~1_hook2=Absolutely not. Please continue.
~01~prompt~panel_010.(hook_and_hook2_are_friends).(hook2_NOT_snark)~1_hook2=Precisely my point.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook=When I asked you to come with me on a little trip... I didn't tell you how far we might be going. I didn't tell you our destination is a place I've dreamed of all my life, or that I worry death waits for us there.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hook=But you see... following a dream is a kind of last resort. For those who can't go back to sleep.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook2=<hook2.coward/healer/leader/loner:I'm not going to forgive you if this is how I die. Come on, then./Have you thought of just drinking warm tea? No? Fine, I guess I'm in./You're not exactly filling me with confidence... but alright. I'll go./And following a dreamer is a good way to get your head chopped. But I guess I'm in.>
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:That was a really bad sell-job, <hook>. I'm out on this one./Trouble sleeping? Have you tried mulemoss? I've got some here, so... No need for a journey./You've been sleeping fine, though. For bad dreams, I've heard that people burn gweldleaf?/--->
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
