~01~~panel_001~1_npc2=Farmers coming? Naw, no cart.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=A long week later, on a windless afternoon...
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=<npc2> the millkeeper squints as distant shadows resolve into shapes with remembered faces.
~01~~panel_003~1_npc2=Oh, them! They'd love if I broke out the beer, I expect.
~01~~panel_004~1_npc2=And why wouldn't I?
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=At the millkeeper's fire, <hook> and <hook2> drink a little.
~01~~panel_005~3_narration=Good having the sky off them. Good smelling dry buildingstones and breadgrain.
~01~~panel_007~2_hook=What's wrinkling [i]you[]?
~01~~panel_008~2_hook2=Said you were leaving the company. For good. Guess that's still got me thinking.
~01~~panel_009~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Really didn't expect to be coming back./I was talking about starting fresh, \nwasn't I? Some other place?/Would you have gone with me? If... I mean, at this point it would be.../==>
~01~~panel_010~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]Yeah? I was going to ask, but I also didn't want to./[face:interested]Decided against it, though?/You're [i]not[] planning on going away now, are you?/==>
~01~~panel_011~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:neutral]You [i]went[]. Now you're coming back. Wasn't like you found anything worth staying for./[face:neutral]It's your old thing, I know. They call it roamingwant. Travel-longing. Or also.../[face:interested]I know, love. It's your traveling heart. \nAnd yes. I'd stay with you./==>
~01~~panel_011~2_hook=I was going [i]somewhere[], I thought. But really, I just wanted to go anywhere. Anywhere new. It's my...
~01~~panel_012~4_npc2=Got potatoes and market sausage frying up.
~01~~panel_013~5_hook2=That'll be nice.
~01~~panel_013~6_hook=Thanks.
~01~~panel_014~4_npc2=You know, reminds me of the people I grew up with. Pushing hard on whoever wouldn't push back. Why do you think I ended up out here? There's those sorts, all over.
~01~~panel_015~1_npc2=All you've told me, and all I can divine about you... You'll always be needed elsewhere. Good folks are needed everywhere.
~01~~panel_016~4_npc2=Yes, and answer that call if you can. When you can. Just don't underestimate the value of having a place to come home to.
~01~~panel_017~1_npc2=Oh, the...!
~01~~panel_017~2_action=POP!!
~01~~panel_017~3_narration=The food in the pan complains. \n<npc2> scoots back to <npc2.mf:his/her/their> kitchen.
~01~~panel_019~1_hook2=Was a good thing, you know? And I'm glad with how we managed it. For all their faults, taking the lives of those two bandits... will weigh on me.
~01~~panel_019~2_hook=Glad. Yeah. Others'll be alright?
~01~~panel_020~1_narration=The young objector was run through.
~01~~panel_020~2_narration=<npc4.mf:He/She/They> fell back, a crimson smear painting the wall. \nBut <npc4.mf:he/she/they> fell into familiar arms.
~01~~panel_021~1_narration=<npc4.mf:His/Her/Their> <npc3.mf:brother/sister/sibling>, <npc3>, abandoned all else. Ran to staunch the wound.
~01~~panel_021~2_narration=Afterwards, the two were left with a pair of local healers, and the bloody inheritance of the bandits' takings.
~01~~panel_022~1_hook2=<npc4.mf:That brave boy/That brave girl/That brave kid>'ll recover. It was a near thing. <hook2.personality:If they've got any capacity for absorbing a lesson, they'll find a different path./If they... I mean, I [i]hope[] they seek safer careers. But...[face:interested]/[face:happy]And now back to [i]our[] boring lives, I guess. Right?/[face:skeptical]Still think we should've kept something for ourselves./[face:talking]Kind of wish we'd stayed, and... well, tried to help them on a better path./[face:grim]Got their lives to live, now. Don't really deserve much more than that./<npc3> said <npc3.mf:he/she/they>'d give as much back as <npc3.mf:he/she/they> could./[face:neutral]But oh well. /Told them to open a tavern. Place a bad past can ferment, become bitter wisdom./They'll have stories under their eyes, at least. <hook2.awm:Women/Men> find that alluring.[face:happy]/[face:skeptical]But I mean, who's ever [i]alright[]? I'm not alright. I'm less and less alright.>
~01~~panel_022~2_hook=Only fear is that the commoners won't be ready to forgive them.
~01~~panel_023~2_narration=<hook> unrolls the poster that pulled <hook.mf:him/her/them> across the world.\nThough creased and stained, old ink still gleams in the firelight.
~01~~panel_024~1_hook=Not everyone's meant to be heroes, I suppose.
~01~~panel_024~2_narration=<hook.mf:He wads/She wads/They wad> the paper into a ball...
~01~~panel_024~3_action=[actionSmall]...crmple...
~01~~panel_025~2_action=[actionSmall][brown]fwsh
~01~~panel_025~3_narration=...and <hook.mf:flicks/flicks/flick> it into the flames.
