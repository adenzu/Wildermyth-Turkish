And they'd teach me too. I mean, learning always goes both ways. Instill the virtues in them that they'll need./[face:interested]I don't know if I could handle it. You know, because I... tend to want to disappear sometimes. And that might be okay./[face:happy]I'd take my example from the moon. <hook.mf:He shines and veils his/She shines and veils her/They shine and veil their> face in turn, so <hook.mf:his/her/their> children learn to live with <hook.mf:him/her/them> and without./[face:happy]I wouldn't want to keep them swaddled in rules and restrictions their whole lives. Let them be free, find love./[face:joy]I'd raise them to be clever, obviously. Not like their <hook.mf:dad/mom/parent>.> But then...
