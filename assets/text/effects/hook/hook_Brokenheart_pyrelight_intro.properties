~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook2=Imagine finding <hook>, staring brokenly upon the river.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]Imagine <hook2>, snooping and snorting around for no reason./Was I supposed to be somewhere?/Looking for me?/--->
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2.snark.55:Now, <hook>. Long as you're around, I've always got a reason./[face:skeptical]I don't snort, do I? >/<hook2.healer.70:You've been withdrawn, lately. Felt like I should check on you./Nowhere particular. \nWhat's up?>/<hook2.romantic.75:[face:sad]In a lot of ways, I still am looking for you./Sort of. I mean I don't know. I usually am, I guess.>/--->
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Well, you won't need to spy anymore. I'm leaving./...I have to go away./I'm sorry. I think... I have to go away for a while./--->\n<hook.rfln.hook2:[hook2.face:dubious]/[hook2.face:interested]/[hook2.face:interested]/--->
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook=Can I tell you the truth? There was a <npc.mf:man/woman/person> named <npc>. It's hard for me to say it, but...
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]Okay... but.../[face:skeptical]Just like that, huh?/[face:sad]Can't pretend I didn't see it coming, I suppose.../>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:I've never gotten it out of my head. That I let <npc.mf:him/her/them> down./I can't help feeling responsible for what happened to <npc.mf:him/her/them>.../I had feelings for <npc.mf:him/her/them>. And... \nI couldn't save <npc.mf:him/her/them>./--->

~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]<hook2.bookish/healer/70:You seem to be speaking in vagaries as a way to stifle my interest. I'm afraid it's having the opposite effect./<hook>, I know we don't see eye-to-eye all that much, but I want you to know I understand. At least a little./And you're telling me this. Can I ask why?>/[face:talking]<hook2.goofball/leader/60:Yeah, that makes sense. Just like you're responsible for when it rained the other day, and <town> having an awful name like <town>. Is it more stuff like that...?/Of course you can't. That's how people like us respond when we lose the ones we care for./I'm sure you have your reasons... But... What are they? Can I ask you that?>/<hook2.hothead/loner/healer/snark/60:Were you expecting me to shout at you? Or just to let you abandon us here?/Everyone has a past, <hook>./Oh, <hook>. You don't give yourself enough credit. Or enough forgiveness./And I'm supposed to take this well, am I? Just accept it, and let you walk away?/Well, I'm glad we've got that out in the open.>/--->
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:I just want you to know, I guess... I'm not abandoning you all for no reason./It's one of those things... I can't put it to rest./Still... I love you, <hook2>, but I.../--->
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:But. Look, neither of us owes the other anything. So if you.../But if both of us leave.../You don't even know where this might lead! I don't even know where.../--->
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Alright, so you've got a reason. Still, I'll probably need to trail you. Might as well go together./Well I'm not letting you go alone. Not the way you look right now./<hook2.healer/hothead/romantic/snark:So let me come with you. We'll face whatever this is together./ If you're going, then I'm following. It's that simple./I'm tough to convince. But I am an awful romantic, so if you work on me, all journey through.../You [i]still[] love me? Grug. I'd better come with you. Let me get my boots and gear...>/--->
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]Who said anything about a debt? I just don't trust you, that's all it is./[face:skeptical]Then we each have a better chance of coming back./[face:skeptical]Yes you do./--->
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook=...fine. <hook.rfln.hook2:We leave, then. Try to keep up./Together, then./I only don't want you to get hurt./--->
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=...well. I'm not ready to go, yet. I'll tell you when the time is right.
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
