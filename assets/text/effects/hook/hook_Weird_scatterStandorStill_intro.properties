You alright?/[face:grim]What'd you want [i]me[] for?/They told me to come get you. Storytelling game they're doing.[face:skeptical]>/<hook2.bookish/goofball/loner/60:Ah, um, <hook>. I do hate being interrupted when I'm reading, but I wanted to ask...[face:interested]/[face:joy]Here you are. Rusting your eyes on a soggy book. How normal!/Came for your whetstone. I can just grab it, right?/<hook>? What'd you say to the bakerboy? He looked [i]rattled[].>/<hook2.bookish/greedy/romantic/60:[face:skeptical]Heard you were getting recitative, dear. What book is that?/[face:talking]Hey, love. Pig's on the spit. Don't have long. What is it?/I come on the night breeze, even before your voice calls out to me...[face:happy]/Hey, love, someone said you fell in the river? You okay?[face:interested]>/==>

~01~prompt~panel_006~4_hook=[face:neutral]A doctor's text. Doctor <npc.lastname>, <npc.mf:his/her/their> name is. <hook.bookish/hothead/60:Impressively turbid ideas.

~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=<hook.personality:Like a very obligated frog, yes. The question is what was it that did the frogprodding? Curiosity, a bookfond conscience, or a firmer, more foreign hand?/Imagine if I'd drowned. [ni]That[] can always happen. <hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2> would be grinning over my sodden body, I'm sure./<hook2> would probably be as sad as any of them. Good old <hook2>./<hook2> wouldn't forgive me for that./==>/[face:happy]I am the toad who doesn't bellow. I am the mustard that doesn't kick. I am <hook.fullname>, and I am never found dry of secrets./And there were other things on the streambed... glinting, sleeping articles, lost or thrown away./I hope that person wasn't planning to come back for it. I feel like it's a safe assumption, but maybe.../[face:grim]And it's a shame I didn't accost that person then and there. Throwing a book in the river is ratty behavior./What drives us to rescue what never did good for us? I suppose the idea that all things might, eventually or in an alternate version of the world... show us their worth...?/I am a [i]lot[] like a dog. The feral kind, who doesn't put up with the condescension of the common two-legs./What drives us to rescue what never did good for us? I suppose the idea that all things might, eventually or in an alternate version of the world... show us their worth...?/And can I help it if... maybe you swim down to bring the book back, you open it... and out spills a beautiful <hook.awm:woman/man>. Made of shadow and letters, and completely [i]sopping[].../[face:skeptical]Well, and plus, I figure a book that gets tossed in the water like that is probably magic. And probably dangerous.

It's somewhere else...[hook2.face:interested]/You look <hook2.whm:strong, but you've got weaknesses in your chest and brain, don't you?/like you drifted here, a dandelion seed./so wise when you're full of questions.

And I'm... I'm a...[hook2.face:interested]/You've got that look on your face. You'd fold up the sky to get your hands on a star. There's worms of wanting in the soil we build our homes on./I wonder how long it's been since you broke something. Just reached for something, no reason at all... and snapped it in two.[hook2.face:interested]/Sometimes, I'm not even sure why, [i]I[] wished to face death. Triumph over death is maybe how we prove we're alive. That's an icky marsh worth visiting./I get unmoored, and I drift sometimes. You don't seem like you're that way, or you don't let yourself seem it. That's another place we could go, I guess.[hook2.face:interested]/Did you think you wouldn't need to succumb to loneliness, if you were fighting on its side? We should visit that idea, maybe./There's two moons, basically. If you see more moons than that, you're being childish. But if you see fewer... you may need this more than I do./I see it behind [i]your[] eyes sometimes, too. Things going unexpressed will dig fortifications in you. And then they won't easily be removed./There's a ridge between honesty and deceit. A high narrow road of not quite lies and not full truths. You seem good at walking it.>
