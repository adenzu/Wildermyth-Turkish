The statue?>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_037~1_legend=An acne-scarred pinstrel is what <hero.mf:he was/she was/they were>! <hero.mf:Ansel Aristallas, his/Aria Anistallas, her/Ansel Aristallas, their> bad\nand cumbersome name! <hero.mf:He/She/They> played at paying me tribute!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_038~1_legend=[light]Came lowtailed under my perch like a strood. Only, as I looked in the gem <hero.mf:he/she/they> offered, <hero.mf:he/she/they> then dealt me a blow that would kill <legend.mf:mortal men/a mortal/a mortal>...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_040~1_legend=[light]So, by some power's hand, the great balance of my [i]self[]... poured from me. My essence. Was imprisoned within that jewel for eternity. And I began my wingless exile.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_041~3_legend=Cast clattering down the mountain, a marrowless bone. Little to no memory, thereafter of what I'd been. I had to remember [i]forcibly,[] through an embattling fog. Over [i]eons.[]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_041~4_hook=How [i]long[] ago are we meant to believe this all happened?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_041~5_hook2=[small]Ever heard something like this?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_042~3_legend=Hm? Oh. My body. This shell that prattles before you... it dies, but always resolves again. To life. Call it [i]my[] curse. I'm almost powerless, now. Over millenia, I've roaved. For untold stretches of time, I was so weak I could barely eat. But I did hunger. Hunger was all I had...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_043~5_hook2=Yet you found the strength to curse [i]me.[] Unless that's another lie.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_044~6_legend=Ah! Yes.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_045~2_legend=Yes, around the time you were a child, <hook2>, a mighty quake split the earth. The sealed chamber wherein <hero.mf:Aristallas/Anistallas/Aristallas> was buried with my powers must've broken open. This allowed some of my strength to seep back to me...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_047~3_legend=Unfortunately the hallowed tomb still repelled my gaze, my steps, my efforts to attack it. Believe it or not, a certain slant of the spell meant that only well-meaning hands could draw the stone from its place.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_048~1_legend=Ingeniously, then, I laid a curse on a child.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_049~6_hook2=On [i]me.[]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_049~7_legend=Right. The idea being, as demonstrated, to set in motion a pure-seeming quest that would serve my ultimate ends.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_050~7_legend=Once retrieved, I would bind the curse into the gem in place of my own... oh. The curse? Mm. Probably?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_050~8_hook=And it's really going to kill <hook2.mf:him/her/them>?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_051~7_legend=Unless the curse's caster is kil... um. Or. \nI guess I should stop, uh. Saying things.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_052~7_legend=Anyway, thanks for listening, my sadlings. You may \njourney on, if you wish! I... um. Won't. Stop you.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_narration=The pair of them dig in the <hook.bookish/goofball/loner/poet:grayblue soil and ash./dirt by the statue's feet./hard earth at the statue's feet./hallowed cold earth.>
~07~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_hero=The cave clouds up, their foreheads steam, and they don't speak. Chop and scuff of shovels, echoes, grunts, and heavy breaths.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_002~2_action=[actionSmall][tan]grnk!
~07~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_narration=Deeper and deeper, the hole widening. The soil rich-smelling, smoky and sharp.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_action=[actionSmall][darkGold]ptweh!
~07~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_narration=And then...

~07~player_chose_two~panel_016~4_hook=Hm?
~07~player_chose_two~panel_017~3_hook2=What do you figure this means?
~07~player_chose_two~panel_017~7_hook=Ohhh. [i]This?[] What does [i]this[] mean, you're asking?
