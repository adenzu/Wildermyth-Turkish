~01~~panel_004~4_hook2=<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/poet/60:[face:skeptical]Fascinating little creatures. But, as we often find, a bit on the aggressive side./Cavelings.

Kind of cute, but a little over-aggressive.[face:interested]/[face:talking]Nothing to worry about. \nYou both alright?/[face:grim]Strange beasts. Almost hate to kill them. But the earth takes everything back, eventually./[face:talking]Just a couple weird cave beasts. No match for [i]us[], when it came to it.>
~01~~panel_005~3_hook=<hook.greedy/leader/loner/60:Sure. But don't feel like that makes you indebted to me. Because.../[face:grim]Old magic healed you. Your <npc.mf:brother/sister/sibling>, who guided us here, <npc.mf:he/she/they> healed you. My part was small./[face:skeptical]Anybody would've. Don't overglow./Couldn't leave you out there like that, really. Anyway, just glad it worked.>
~01~~panel_005~4_npc2=<npc2.goofball/loner/snark/60:[face:happy]<hook>? You're my savior?/[face:skeptical]<hook>? Heard what you did. I.../[face:skeptical]<hook>? You're the one who... healed me?/You... your name is <hook>? You healed me?>

~01~~panel_006~5_hook2=<hook2.coward/loner/snark/60:Maybe let's move away from this place? While we talk?[face:interested]/[face:grim]This isn't the time for making words. Let's make distance./[face:dubious]Let's go before a [i]third[] sticky monster drops on our heads./[face:talking]Best thing now is to get away from here. Talk as you walk.>
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=They follow their own path out. Afternoon flares and begins to fail. Firs and wild herbs scent the trek.
~01~~panel_008~3_hook=<hook.personality:[face:talking]Did you remember? All those years, decades? Did you remember the final breath, or... does anything strike you now?/[face:interested]Can't imagine how terrifying it must've been. Did you feel anything, when you were... you know. Stone?/[face:happy]So tell me how a rock feels? I've never met one before./[face:skeptical]Probably don't have any belongings besides what you're wearing, right? Which, lucky it all got frozen [i]with[] you./[face:talking]Not to make you dwell on it, if it's uncomfortable, but... flesh, to stone, to flesh again? Are you feeling alright?/[face:grim]You must be angry. Stuck that way for so long, \nwithin sight of a remedy./Can't be easy. Coming back to a world and thirty years gone./All I mean is... I felt [i]forced[] to act. There was no real way to do anything different./To go to sleep for so long... have so much of what you loved pass you by... There can't be any comparison./[face:talking]It's still a beautiful world, you know? I've always... anyway, you'll find so much to love, to do. Your life is only now getting started./[face:dubious]Hey, <npc2>? Here's the thing. You have to use your life well, okay? Better than me. And I get half all your beers.>
~01~~panel_008~4_npc2=<hook.personality:<npc2.poet/snark/60:Kind of like falling asleep. Sometimes restless, surfacing to an unfamiliar consciousness. Darkness. Sometimes dreaming. But it didn't feel as long as it must've been./You thinking about writing a novel? No, I don't know. Dim ideas of who I was. Mostly nothing. Like when you sleep./Most of it was kind of... like when you're asleep, and you have a brief moment like, "Oh, I'm supposed to be awake, I think." But you don't wake up, and it goes away.>/<npc2.coward.60:[face:interested]Can't stop moving my fingers, elbows, neck. I doubt I'll ever be able to sit perfectly still again. Or it feels like that./What [i]did[] it feel like? There's not much of a memory, there. Hulking beast, burning eyes, I reached for an arrow... then nothing.>/<npc2.bookish/goofball/60:[face:interested]That's a good point, I wonder if all stones have a kind of consciousness in them. Floating through haze, dreaming long slow dreams. Hm.../[face:joy]What? I mean, kind of amazing. Also kind of dull. Feeling nothing, barely dreaming in an endless fog. Think I should introduce myself as <npc2> the Rock?/[face:skeptical]That's... wow. Feels like nothing, I guess. Or close to nothing. Endless sleeping with only the dimmest dreams.>/<npc2.greedy.60:[face:skeptical]Yeah, it's... I didn't ever own much to begin with. Wanted to sell clothes like my father. A tailor. But as I got older, I don't know. And now.../[face:interested]That's true, I guess. Being alive's the main thing I care about right now. But sure, there's... a lot more to consider, eventually.>/<npc2.bookish/coward/poet/60:[face:skeptical]You know, I'm really [i]intrigued[]. Yes, horrified, but I can't help thinking... what an unbelievable [i]experience[]. Right? Still processing it, I guess./[face:interested]Can't stop moving my fingers, elbows, neck. I doubt I'll ever be able to sit perfectly still again. Or it feels like that./Things are meant to change in seasons. Trees, stars, bodies, feelings. I've been [i]stuck[], as few or no people ever are. To me, that's both sad and... unique? Don't know yet./I'm fine, I guess. Weirdly fine. I know I should be older. I know the world has gone by, my father... But I'm here, alive. That's enough, for now.>/<npc2.hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:grim]Angry at [i]myself[], mostly. Rushed in all unprepared. Should've been dead forever. Could've got my <npc.mf:brother/sister/sibling> killed, too./Angry? Hm. It's not anger. Glad to be alive, but a little... well. How am I [i]supposed[] to feel?/[face:dubious]Would it surprise you to learn luck's never favored me?/[i]Angry's[] not the right word. I've lost so much. Father. Years with my <npc.mf:brother/sister/sibling>. But today... Suddenly have a whole life to live. Right? So...>/<npc2.goofball/hothead/60:[face:happy]It's [i]pretty[] easy. I can dance again! I bet I'll be dancing the rest of my life./[face:interested]What I [i]want[]... is to face that wretched thing again. Isn't that kind of crazy? Prove I can overcome what stopped me then. But.../[face:skeptical]Better than not coming back at all. But yeah. It'll take getting used to.>/<npc2.greedy/loner/poet/60:[face:skeptical]I can tell you... I wouldn't have done it, I don't think. So. You may not realize how [i]generous[] you are. But I do./I get it. But I think you... when it matters most, you're generous. Beyond what's normal. That's admirable./[face:talking]In my limited years, I felt... that a person who stands apart is one who cares [i]more[]. Cares never to hurt another, nor be hurt. The most generous hearts of all, perhaps, are the loneliest./[face:sad]No. [i]Thank you[]. Truly. Again, and a hundred times, and forever. And I'm sorry for what it cost you...>/<npc2.hothead/poet/snark/60:[face:skeptical]No, you're right, it's pretty crummy. But I'm alive, I'm healthy, I'm... [i]hungry[], actually. Those are great things to be, having been nothing for so long./[face:talking]Well... maybe not. But there's something [i]powerful[] in that. I want to find what it means to me. And maybe someday I'll be able to share it all. In a way that matters./[face:skeptical]Nice of you to remind me. But yes, you're right. And it's only thanks to your own sacrifice that I get to experience any of it. So.../I guess not, huh?[face:interested] Sleeping's not even a perfect way to say it. I was... [i]stuck[]. And that feeling will haunt me...>/<npc2.greedy/loner/romantic/snark/60:Oh, I plan on making the most of it, trust me. [face:skeptical]Mind's only now thinking of all the things I want to try, and do, and have, and.../Wondering where there is to go from here, I guess. I guess I don't need somewhere. Going anywhere's just as good./[face:happy]You don't have to worry about me. I've never backed down from getting the most out of my chances. Only wish.../[face:skeptical]Appreciate you saying so. I... it's going to take a while, discovering what to care about. But I guess... anyway, I'm grateful for the chance to do so./No, yeah, I know. Or I mean, I'd like to know. [face:skeptical]It'll just be tough that... that you had to give up so much. Won't lie, I'll think about it, and...>/Not a bad bargain. [face:happy]I accept your terms.>
~01~~panel_009~2_narration=Their return is faster and more eager.
~01~~panel_009~3_narration=<hook> and the <npc2.mf:boy/girl/child>, <npc2>, carry on a conversation, awkward but important to them both.

~01~~panel_012~5_npc=But the life <hook.mf:he's/she's/they've> brought back... that matters to <hook.mf:him/her/them>. Be kind about it. Be kind to them both, I must humbly ask you. Neither deserved their fates. But their paths crossed.
~01~~panel_014~2_narration=By the time stars appear, <hook2> and <npc> have a fire blazing, \na stew of wild onions and mushrooms to fill them all.

~01~~panel_017~6_npc2=<npc2.personality:There's so much I wish to learn, understand. Nowhere to go, though. Nowhere else than with you. That is, if you'll have me./I'll say right now, I'm pretty shaken. Like, I don't know how I'll ever close my eyes again. Maybe that's why I want to be like you. Stronger. Please. If you'll have me./[face:joy]Well yeah! Look at me! I'm flesh and warm again, I'm alive! It's heroes that give this to people, and I want to be one of you! I'd even excel, I think!/I don't know what else there is for me. Tailoring? My dad was a tailor. But I've been turned to stone. I want more out of life./Maybe it's naive, but... I want to [i]help[]. Somehow. Feel like I've lived nightmares, and I want to save others from having to do the same./[face:talking]Everything was over for me... until it wasn't. So I'm just going to live like I'm on fire. Part of that's living [i]for[] something./[face:talking]Listen, I'm capable of a lot. I'll learn, I'll do the work. Whatever's needed, and whoever I have to prove myself to, I'll do it./[face:skeptical]So... Listen, I guess I just can't be who I want to be, alone. Need training, support. At least for a while. This proved it to me, I guess. So.../[face:talking]They say when a fish is pulled from the pond they grew up in, placed in another, they'll die if they don't find other fish to swim with. My dad... Well he.../[face:happy]You need volunteers, don't you? Seems that way to me. [i]I[] need a livelihood, a place to belong, a way to impress <npc2.awm:women/men>. It's a perfect match!/[face:skeptical]Well, and yeah, I guess I lost the only battle I ever fought, which... maybe doesn't recommend me. But I'm not useless. I can at least do [i]laundry[] without becoming a stone.>
~01~~panel_018~7_narration=The sky deepens. A moonless sea of stars crossed by fast clouds.
~01~~panel_019~9_npc=Dad would be proud, <npc2>. And I'll always be. Whatever path you take.
~01~~panel_020~9_hook=<hook.personality2:They're not simple, the tasks we assign ourselves. We study, we learn, we [i]strive[] to be equal to them. Be prepared to seek answers most would rather not know./How many times have I wished to be at home? To know nothing of trailfood, shadowthings, gorgonry and all the rest? Just... hope you're ready./Listen, let me be serious, for a second. Heroing around isn't happy work. Takes a certain kind of person. Have to be able to find humor in sorrow.../I wouldn't be overquick deciding what to do. I'd weigh my options, is all. But I know, when I feel like [i]I[] need something, then.../You know, there's lots of ways to make a difference. But as long as you're sure... My friends'll be lucky to have you./I get it. You're probably just about ready to turn the whole world over. Wouldn't want to get in your way./It's not an easy life, or a safe one. But if you feel resolved on pursuing it... It really won't matter if we deny you./Who am I to question your reasons? My only advice is to think about it a while longer. Sometimes [i]I[] wish I'd gone off on my own./I wonder, sometimes, what draws us in. What makes us ask for a burden? Are we moths, lost to our homes, longing for warmth?/[face:interested]There are things about this life that always enticed me, too. But it's not all rose-thrown gallantry, as you can see. It's a lot of pain, mud, laughterless silence./You sure? Do you even have the potential in you? Look, I don't know... But if you die before I do, I [i]will[] be livid. Your grave will be a boot.>
