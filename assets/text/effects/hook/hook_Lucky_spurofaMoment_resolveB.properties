~01~~panel_001~1_hook2=<hook2.bookish/goofball/healer/loner/60:It's remarkable to find one alone like this. Up here? Would be curious what directed its decision. If decision is even the right word./Well, Big Boneclaw's tweezed <hook.mf:his/her/their> last soul, I'd say./If we could somehow [i]speak[] to them... I wonder what they'd say./All alone up here... you wonder what <hook2.mf:he was/she was/they were> [i]doing[]./Wonder what this thing was up to?>
~01~~panel_001~2_hook=<hook2.coward/greedy/poet/60:There's likely more. Let's get moving./Best collect our prize and go while we can./Let's not be the mice who play too long in the cat's garden./Let's not rouse more of them.>
~01~~panel_002~1_hook=Right, that's what I mean.\nThen back the way we came.
~01~~panel_002~2_hook2=We can grab some of these materials.
~01~~panel_003~3_narration=A short while later...
~01~~panel_004~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]//[face:happy]/>Seems you did.
~01~~panel_005~1_hook2=So... looks like I won the bet.
~01~~panel_006~3_hook=What do I owe you now? <hook.rfln.hook2:Something weird?[face:skeptical]/Socks?/[face:joy]Actually... I remember./>
~01~~panel_006~4_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:scheming]I get to rename you./[face:joke][i]New[] socks, let's be sure to mention./[face:happy]<hook.greedy/healer/hothead/60:[i]I[] didn't forget./It's okay, love./Don't play the forgetful card [i]now[]!/Do you?>/>
~01~~panel_007~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:joy]Nope!/[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/>
~01~~panel_007~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]Oh. I thought that was a joke./[face:joke]What you've failed to mention is a [i]size[]./[face:joke]Oh, don't worry. Some bets, you kind of hope to lose.../>
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=On the journey back, the weather turns.
~01~~panel_009~1_hook2=There's a teahouse. \nNot far.
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=They don't make it in time, and are soaked in the storm.
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=But the teahouse is dry, the fragrant teas, and later the mugs of mulled whiskey, are hot.
~01~~panel_011~1_hook=<hook.personality://////////>
~01~~panel_011~2_hook2=Here's one more round for you<hook.rfln.hook2:, Gawbawg././, <hook>./>
~01~~panel_012~1_hook=<hook.personality://////////>Just rain.
~01~~panel_012~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:neutral]/[face:interested]/>Thinking about something?
~01~~panel_012~4_action=[actionSmall][brown]*slosh*
~01~~panel_013~1_hook=<hook.personality:[face:interested]Rain and all these nigh-mystical phenomena that paint our lives. That we try to explain into mundanity. So we can take them for granted./[face:interested]We flee the rain, we fan the fire. We flee the fire, we wish for rain. It's not hypocrisy, I think it's just the laws of living. Sides of a scale, we balance away from trouble./Rain's complex. Sometimes you go out to feel it on your face, to laugh in it. Farmers wish it on their crops, but in the wrong season... it causes ruin./[face:skeptical]I used to like running in the rain. When I had nothing but my name, and... I guess I was freer, then. Sometimes you lose by gaining, or gain by losing./Season to season, rain to rain, festival to festival. We do these things over and over. But the meanings change. A rain on ripe crops, or a rain on hungry seeds. The first day of rain, or the sixth./I've never liked rain much. Keeps people inside, no games, stops the work. Makes tough stuff tougher. But then you smell it, or watch it... and you feel [i]lucky[] it's here./We get so busy sometimes, we don't think about the rain. It's one more obstacle. It's weather, it's worry. Right now... I think it shows how good luck might fly inside dark clouds./Rain. It's one of the only voices I love to listen to. It can cause ruin, it can come at bad times... Still, you can't judge a rain good or bad, until you've seen all it leads to./I know I talk about so many different... ideas. But rain is something else. It summons lives from the seeds, it drowns others. It's the perfect metaphor for luck. Unreliable, inscrutable, amazing./[face:interested]There's nothing more dramatic than a rainstorm. It can heighten any mood: love, longing, loss, and laziness... It hangs on the tilt of your perceptions, doesn't it? Luck's like that, I think./Rain's a bastard, a lot of the time. Havoc on houses, on travelers, drowning out crops and whatever. But there's times it comes as a kind of respite. Beyond our control. I don't know what to call that, but...>
~01~~panel_014~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Even here with you.../I don't know./This evening with you./> Think back to our journey's beginning. Fortune is the spur of a moment that strikes restless hearts and sparks an adventure. Luck is the people you share it with.

~01~~panel_015~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:grim]You've had too much./[face:joy]Guess I need another cup!/[face:happy]Hm. Those words are nice./>
~01~~panel_016~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]You just haven't had [i]enough[]!/[face:interested]Yeah?/[face:happy]I'm keeping tonight. I'll hold on to it forever./>
~01~~panel_017~2_action=<hook.rfln.hook2:One more, then./Just one more./Yeah. Me too./>
