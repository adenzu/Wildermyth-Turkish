The seeing, the looking./[face:joy]I used to imagine hopping stars, when I was scared. Or just anxious. Or I'd pissed someone off. Getting up there, jumping from one to the next. Getting away./Used to think about them as fireflies. The stars. I'd sweep them up in a net of blankets. Peel the blankets away, and there they'd be... Icybright. Crystal bellies./I would've gone to the stars if I could. I do believe that. Thinking back... Would've abandoned everything I cared about./Stars are annoying, aren't they? So removed from everything. So far away you can't tell... they're probably not perfect either./Imagine... you transcend your body when you die. You become a star. I used to think that was what happened to heroes./Used to envy the stars. Brilliant, distant, unreachable, unknowable. Nothing will ever touch them./Stars. Scattered and strange.

But I'm here, and there's more... more to... to do./I wish I could look up there and... I guess... I don't know. Not that wishing matters.[face:interested]/But... I know a few heroes now. Many more, I've known. I've seen what happens to them./[face:skeptical]I don't know why, but... I've begun... to pity them? Is that true, now?/I once wondered if... no, I believed I [i]would[] travel to them, when I was old enough to go. Once, I believed that./[i]My[] face's different.
