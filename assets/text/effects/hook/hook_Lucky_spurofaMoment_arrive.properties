~01~prompt~panel_001~2_hook2=So this forest [i]has[] an edge. That's nice.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hook=I see the edge of the forest.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook.coward/hothead/leader/snark/60:[face:interested]Well, what? You want to turn around?/[face:joke]Can't stick it out any farther?/[face:grim]You thinking of giving up?/[face:joke]Aha![i] Someone's[] getting tired.../[face:interested]You want to give up?>/<hook.healer/loner/poet/60:[face:happy]Come on, now. All things have an ending, somewhere./[face:grim]Everything has an edge./[face:interested]All things are bound to have limits./[face:skeptical]Of course it does. Everything has limits.>/<hook.romantic.60:Oh, please. Wandering the trees, far from anyone. Just you and me...? You [i]like[] it./I enjoy the time together. Don't you?>/>
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_hook2=<hook2.rfln.hook:We've been going for weeks./Including my patience./<hook2.coward/leader/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested]What's been going on while we were gone, though?/[face:skeptical]We're being irresponsible./[face:happy]I... alright, yes, I do./[face:happy]Yeah, I do. I like it too much./[face:skeptical]Eh, sure. It's good and all./[face:neutral]It's been a nice week or two.>/>
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Come on.../Look.../But, and...> it was a joke in the first place, wasn't it? \nKeep walking until we find a what? A magic item? \nWhat even [i]is[] that?
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:We had our little competition. Neither of us won, alright?/Nice to take a little trip. But the trip's no longer little. Come on, <hook>./We'll have plenty of time to go on plenty more journeys. For now, though.../>\nTime to go back to our lives.
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_hook=Alright. But can we at least check out that castle first?
~01~prompt~panel_011~nameTag_0=Where There's Presumably a Magic Item
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_hook=Follow me, <hook2>!
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.hothead/leader/loner/60:[face:talking]No sense being delicate./Keep things simple./[face:skeptical]Place is abandoned./Place seems abandoned.> I say we go in the front way.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook2=I'm thinking we climb in a window or something. My bones are on edge.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~2_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/greedy/romantic/60:[face:talking]Stonework isn't fancy, but it's solid. I'd say we're looking at two centuries of rough seasons these walls have withstood./[face:interested]Old castles aren't haunted, are they? Just generally?/Place has probably been looted a dozen times, I suppose./[face:happy]Think about the people who once lived here. Their loves, their wants, their battles and joys./[face:talking]Be honest, though. You thought this whole thing was crazy and overparticular.>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~3_hook2=<hook.bookish/coward/greedy/romantic/60:<hook2.bookish.60:And I appreciate that. But/Well> they're crumbling now./I don't think anything [i]generally[] is. But certain places.../[face:interested]Maybe? It's got a dry smell./I'm more focused on what might be living here [i]now[]./No, yeah, I absolutely did.>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~1_narration=The dim halls are broken and falling in. \nTheir steps scuff dust off the stones.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~2_hook2='Scuse me, mouse.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~2_hook2=Can see straight through the upper floor...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~1_hook=A-ha!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~1_hook=Hup!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~2_action=[tan]clnk!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~1_action=[purple][actionLarge]EMPTY [actionHuge]!!!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_007~1_hook2=Hey, that's life, isn't it?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_008~1_hook2=You know, I [i]am[] glad we stuck this out. Now about the bet...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:The winner gets to rename them./[face:joy]The loser buys them nice socks!/[face:joke]A special favor from the loser./> But I'll be lenient if...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~3_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:What happens to the loser?/What happens to the winner?/What does the winner get?/>
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_011~3_hook=Interesting! Well I'm afraid you spoke too soon, <hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2.mf:Manberg/Womangrog/Personling>./socksy!/love./>\nBecause there's [i]always[] a second chest!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_012~1_hook2=Why wouldn't there be?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_013~1_action=[cherry]Grk.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_014~1_hook=Oh.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_015~2_action=[actionLarge][cherry]GRRRK!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~1_hook=They climb through a crumbling window.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~2_hook=You certainly like to make things hard...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~1_hook2=<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/leader/snark/60:I'm thorough. Always start at the top of a problem, and work your way down. Goes for castles too./A little of [i]my[] caution coupled with [i]your[] good luck ought to serve us well./[face:joy]What!? Did you have to \nsay it like that?/[face:grim]What I'd like is to make you quiet./Always best to depend on more than just luck./[face:talking]Absolutely. This is all [i]my[] fault./I like to make things [i]safer[], where possible.>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~1_hook2=<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/leader/snark/60:<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]Yeah. It does./[face:interested]/[face:dubious]Flattered you think so, love./>/[face:skeptical]Uhh.../[face:joke]/[face:grim]/[face:interested]Huh?/[face:dubious]/<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]Maybe [i]you[] could've./[face:skeptical]I mean, you could fall climbing out of bed, <hook>./[face:skeptical]You could fall climbing out of bed, love. So what?/>>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~2_hook=<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/leader/snark/60:[face:skeptical]Well... fine, that makes some sense./[face:talking]But will it serve us dinner? \nNo. It won't./[face:dubious]/[face:skeptical]To what purpose, exactly?/[face:skeptical]<hook.bookish/leader/60:I think you're misconstruing the implications of a word like [i]luck[]./I agree. But being overcareful can be worse than being rash./Uh... like, give me an example.>/[face:skeptical]/[face:talking]We could've fallen climbing [i]up[] here.>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~1_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/loner/romantic/snark/60:Hard to tell the age. Those doubled beams are a hallmark of <npc> the Builder. <npc.mf:He's/She's/They're> two-hundred years dead./Be nice if the place was in a little better condition, though./Hm. People really lived here? [i]I[] wouldn't. How much would you have to invest, like, all the time, just to keep it standing?/Honestly, I'd like to patch the place up. [i]Someone[] could use it./These places are there, if you seek them out. Dark and cool. Away from prying eyes./[face:happy]Imagine we're alive and this castle is new. The longing looks we cast from these windows, over the lands where our loves bravely roam./[face:skeptical]You know who I keep thinking about? Whoever had to stack all these rocks up. And for what?/Rafters still look pretty solid. I wonder how long this place has been here.>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~3_hook2=<hook.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/loner/romantic/snark/60:<hook2.bookish.60:[face:interested]Oh, interesting! <hook.rfln.hook2:I saw that, of course.../Sharp eye, <hook>./How did I not notice that?/>/That's a pretty long time, huh?>/How long it's been here? It'll stand another day./True, but the benefit is... you have a castle./[face:dubious]I didn't realize you were a mason, <hook.rfln.hook2:<hook>/<hook>/love/>./<hook2.poet.60:It's a place for lost things./It's certainly private.>/<hook2.poet/romantic/60:[face:interested]I wonder who they were... these people. What they thought about./[face:happy]Mm./[face:dubious]Do I have to?>/It's a lot to think about./Longer than it has left, I'd say. Sagging inwards...>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~1_hook=There's a pretty big gap. You can see through to the lower level.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~3_hook2=<hook.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/loner/romantic/snark/60:Well this stuff's more recent./There's something here.../Of course, you might not [i]keep[] your castle. If.../Anyway, I think someone [i]is[]./<hook2.poet.60:And proof wells up before us./Or maybe not so private.>/Might not be abandoned, though./Other things to occupy our minds, though.../Apparently not abandoned, though.>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~1_hook=[face:happy]Does it look magical?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~1_hook2=Little trove. Collected from who knows where.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~1_hook2=Not even a [i]tiny[] bit.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_010~1_hook2=Hm?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_010~2_hook=Tell you what, though.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_011~2_hook=It [i]does[] look guarded!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_011~3_action=[gold]. . . clzzk . . .
