~01~~panel_001~1_narration=After the fighting's done, the grateful <npc> throws a small feast to thank them. \nThe woodland seer, it seems, never foresaw this possibility, this random raving monster that would've devastated all <npc.mf:he/she/they>'d built.

~01~~panel_005~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:joke]I knew we wouldn't be able to count on you for the long fight.../[face:happy]You're a good friend, <hook>. I hope this [i]is[] all you want it to be./[face:sad]You know I will come and visit. But we'll often be apart.../--->
~01~~panel_006~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:We had our disagreements. But you were always staunch when I needed you. And I appreciate that. I always will./Most things aren't. Or not exactly, right? <hook.personality:There's so much to know, so much to explore and understand. I'll be lost a lot, but I like that. The chance to discover my way out of the fog./[face:interested]But all my life, I've run from what my dreams might mean. It'll be nice to... I don't know. Face them. Understand them. [i]Change[] them./[face:joy]Do you think the provincials will believe me? I'm not exactly Sage Solemnsour... Anyway though./[face:joy]I [i]do[] plan to get a bit more enterprising with it than old <npc> seems to've gotten. So.../We get older, we carry as much of our strength with us as we can, but in the end... Anyway, here I can continue to do good. And not by spilling blood./[face:skeptical]Tell you the truth, I'm worried I'll get restless. But then I think about taking on all the challenges I'll face here, and.../[face:happy]Those days will dawn when I wish I was back helping you with my own hands. But I truly believe my place, my role, is here. And.../[face:happy]Still, I was meant for this sort of life. More secluded. And with the trees around./[face:interested]The moon changes <hook.mf:his/her/their> face, the seasons whirl by... I know some days I'll wish I was back with you all. But at the same time.../[face:happy]But the joy in chasing your desires isn't in claiming them, but in seeing where they take you. And into what company, right?/[face:dubious]Me, I can always find something to complain about. [i]That's[] my real talent. But...>/And the times we're together will grow sweeter. I'm not abandoning you, love. I never will. I'll look for you every day, and when you appear, I'll shower you in my eagerness, my affection./--->
