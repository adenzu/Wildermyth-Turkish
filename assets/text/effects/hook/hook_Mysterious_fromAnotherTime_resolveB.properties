.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> return.
.longName=From Another Time
.name=Result
~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The final blow lands and the <npc.mf:man/woman/person> leaks rank smoke from <npc.mf:his/her/their> pores, eyes, nose.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=The corpse collapses beside the water.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Tendrils flow from wounds, they coil. They touch the pool.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=And the blushing pool ripples. Eddies leap up like thirsty tongues. The water steams, bubbles, and begins to swallow the smoke into its strange depths.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Soon the water is pure again.
~01~~panel_003~2_narration=Pinkly sparkling.
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=Drifts of steam nudge their faces, warm, smelling of mineral.
~01~~panel_004~3_hook2=Dead?
~01~~panel_004~4_hook=If alive is what it was, then\nyeah. Let's call it dead.
~01~~panel_006~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Have you lost your head? Why are you grinning?/Are you alright? That was a bit much, wasn't it?/You don't know how good it is to see you smile./>
~01~~panel_007~1_hook2=You can see them? \nYou remember them?
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=<hook> glances into water. And it seems a vision does come to <hook.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~~panel_008~2_hook=My true parents...
~01~~panel_009~4_hook=I don't really remember. Just flashes. Images, now. Sounds. Smells. We lived in a lucky place. By the sea, the mountains, the forests.
~01~~panel_010~4_hook=I look like them.
~01~~panel_011~1_speech=Sound a little like them.
~01~~panel_012~1_speech=<hook.bookish.60:My interests might have been theirs./I remember <npc2.mf:his/her/their> face, mid-sentence.>
~01~~panel_018~3_hook2=<hook>? So we're clear... That thing we fought. It was something from before?
~01~~panel_019~1_speech=Trapped inside a tree, I suppose.\nI didn't mean to set it free.
~01~~panel_020~3_hook=I believe it was a Lostling. Breathing, roiling. \nFrom a storybook, only... It ended my parents' lives.
~01~~panel_020~4_hook=And mine too. Forced me to start new. Shedding the memories. The guilt.
~01~~panel_021~3_hook2=It's dead now. We finished it. <hook.rfln.hook2:Things like that... I'm sorry, anyway. You don't deserve to... have that in your past./And hey... don't feel responsible. You were just a kid./And <hook>, love, you're not to blame. Your parents would be so proud of you./>
~01~~panel_022~1_narration=They make their way from the canyon, to the mountains, to the hills and woods, and finally...
~01~~panel_023~1_hook=Home again.
~01~~panel_025~1_action=. . .
~01~~panel_026~1_hook=[gray]<hook2>...
~01~~panel_027~1_hook=[gray]<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:interested]You're a good <hook2.mf:man/woman/person>./Sleep well./Sleep well./>
