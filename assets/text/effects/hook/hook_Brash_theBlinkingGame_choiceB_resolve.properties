~01~~panel_001~1_hook2=<hook2.goofball/healer/leader/romantic:A wise bird, indeed. Wise-[i]cracking[], maybe./Oh, <hook2>. Clumsy fool./I forget if I'm supposed to add the salt now, or.../<hook.rfln.hook2:Scars can be sexy.../Scars can be sexy.../At least I've earned some pity-points.../===>>
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=By nightfall, <hook2>'s wound is staunched. A fire <hook2.goofball/healer/leader/romantic:tickles the belly of a tea-kettle, and somewhere an owl blows blue sounds through its beak.../growls pleasantly, heating a salve to help dull the pain./cooks dinner under <hook2.mf:his/her/their> tending eye./gnaws on logs. <hook2.mf:He gazes/She gazes/They gaze> into the flames.>
~01~~panel_002~1_hook2=Hmm? Didn't you say <legend.mf:he/she/they> wouldn't have stuck around?
~01~~panel_003~1_hook=I just did one more sweep of the area...
~01~~panel_004~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Uh... yeah./Alright... thanks, <hook>./Don't blame yourself.../--->
~01~~panel_004~2_hook=Well, sure, but... <hook.coward/leader/loner/snark:I'll still rest easier. And you will, right?/I've already gotten you hurt with my presumptions, haven't I?/Anyway. Just making sure./Years change a person. Unless, obviously, that person is me...>\n\n<hook.rfln.hook2:///--->
~01~~panel_006.(hook_and_hook2_are_rivals)~1_hook2=Hey, you don't have to feel bad. <hook2.healer/loner/snark:I'm the one who wasn't being careful. You know I hate admitting that./I'd rather you didn't./Or I mean... You don't have to [i]pretend[] to feel bad.>
~01~~panel_008.(hook_and_hook2_are_friends)~1_hook2=Come on now. I've gotten hurt worse. <hook2.bookish/hothead/poet:And for stupider reasons!/Hey, I'd be letting you know if I blamed you at all, you know that!/Who's more foolish, the fool, or the fool who follows <hook.mf:him/her/them>?>
~01~~panel_010.(hook_and_hook2_are_lovers)~1_hook2=Hey. It's okay. I'm alright. <hook2.greedy/loner/goofball:Just expect me to use this whenever I want something...!/You feeling bad about it only makes it worse./You know the more you act like this, the more I just want to tease you, right?>
~01~~panel_011~1_hook=Look, I don't know what comes next. It shouldn't be your price to pay, but... <legend.fullname> always put a lot of stock in fairness. <hook.bookish/leader/poet/snark:<legend.mf:His/Her/Their> own kind of honor, rectitude/Justice/Balance/I call it take for took, snit for snat>. So perhaps... perhaps it's over. Score settled.
~01~~panel_012~1_hook2=<hook2.greedy/healer/poet:And if it's not over...?/And by 'perhaps' you mean...?/It seems like a big question to live with.>
~01~~panel_013~1_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark:Well obviously, there's no way to be sure. However.../You never know, of course. But.../I don't want to trick myself./It's not a sure bet. But it's one I'd take./Old grudges are poisons. The toughest ones to quell./Well, I do hate to let <legend.mf:him/her/them> feel like <legend.mf:he's/she's/they've> won. But.../I'll be ready. But let's not live worrying./If <legend.mf:he doesn't/she doesn't/they don't> let it go.../I won't live in fear of shadows./I just have this feeling... Like it has to end./Just, like... >
~01~~panel_014~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Put it this way. If there is a next time, <hook.coward/hothead/loner:I don't like to think of it, but I'll see it ends there./I'll make sure it's the last time./I'll leave you out of it.>/You'll never be caught up in it again, <hook.coward/leader/snark:<hook2>, I'm sorry./I promise you that./<hook2>. I mean... I promise. Hopefully.>/I'll tell you this, <hook2>. <hook.leader/hothead/loner:I never thought you'd be the one at risk. I... can't live with that. So I'll do what I must, if it comes to it./I'll end that muckwad if <legend.mf:he/she/they> ever comes near you again. I won't let you get hurt./Today, we call it over. If <legend.mf:he disagrees/she disagrees/they disagree> ... Anyway, you don't have to worry about it.>/--->
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=<hook2.goofball/healer/leader/romantic:Out in the dark woods, a lone owl cracks its last joke, and wings off. The fire slowly dies,/The numbing salve congeals, it cools, and <hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2> applies it to <hook2.mf:his/her/their> wound./<hook2> applies it to <hook2.mf:his/her/their> wound./<hook> applies it to <hook2>'s wound./---> The fire goes out,/They eat a dinner of stewed lentils, garlic, and wild onions. They <hook.rfln.hook2:sit in silence/talk/reminisce and sing together/---> until the fire dies,/The fire shrinks until it's just small blooms of orange light, splitting the coals and quickly wilting. They lie <hook.rfln.hook2:on either side of it, and think separate thoughts,/on their backs and talk,/together in warmth,/--->> and later they sleep. Neither will ever hear from <legend.fullname> again.
