~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/loner/poet/60:[face:skeptical]Parts of these walls are naturally formed. Others seem to have been dug out./[face:interested]Think these walls might collapse? Tunnels feel kind of brittle, don't they?/[face:happy]In a greasy-dark tunnel, <hook> and <hook2> happily spelunk!/[face:skeptical]I don't smell anything. Whatever dug this place must be dead./[face:happy]You can imagine the wills of whatever dug this place. The seeking minds, the down-delving hands.../I'd imagine we're the first people down here since whoever dug it died.>

~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook=<hook.goofball/greedy/60:Who can tell what resplendent treasures await our bold heroes!/Think what we might find! Wealth? Artifacts of ancient power?/[face:talking]What do you think is down here, <hook2>?>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook2=Perhaps nothing at all. In fact, that is very likely.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook=And yet it doesn't [i]feel[] likely.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hook2=<hook2.hothead.60:These kinds of places can be invigorating, I'll admit that much. Whoever hollowed it out was hoping we wouldn't find it./You do kind of wonder, though. How many places like this echo beneath our feet? How many do we walk over in a day?>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hook=Oh! Dead end?
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=You bring a shovel?
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=They've come to a round chamber, deep beneath the earth. Their torchlight reveals uneven ground, the old marks of tools in the hard dirt.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook=Something must be down here!
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_narration=Something is.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_hook2=<hook2.bookish/coward/healer/hothead/leader/snark:[face:interested]Interesting... Why do you think this was buried here?/[face:interested]Seems to be. But for how long?/[face:interested]Careful now... What should we do with it?/These things can get [i]active[] real quick![face:angry]/This place is dangerous. We should come back here with more people.../>
~01~prompt~panel_015~3_hook=Seems... dead.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook=Well this old <hook.mf:guy/girl/thing> was probably meant as a security measure. So... let's dig up what <hook.mf:he was/she was/they were> guarding?
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook2=Let's dismantle the thing, first. Be methodical about it.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~1_hook2=...digging...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~1_hook=...and digging!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~1_hook=They keep digging...
