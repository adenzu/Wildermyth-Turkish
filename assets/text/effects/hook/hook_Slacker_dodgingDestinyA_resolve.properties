.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> complete a good deed.
.longName=Dodging Destiny
.name=Result
~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The brigand leader lies dead.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=<monster.mf:His/Her/Their> minions flee, to live or bleed cold, their bodies no longer whole.
~01~~panel_002~3_hook2=Hm.
~01~~panel_003~1_npc=That's an end to it, then. Thank you, strangers, [i]thank you[]!
~01~~panel_004~2_hook=We'll stay to bury the <monster.mf:man/woman/person>. Then we'll be gone. Unless you think there's more of them likely on their way?
~01~~panel_004~3_npc2=No, I...
~01~~panel_004~4_npc=In all the time they were here, it was just them. \nRan off whoever came up the road.
~01~~panel_005~4_npc2=Won't you stay? We'll clean up. There's still some untapped kegs. We owe you.
~01~~panel_005~5_npc=<npc2>...
~01~~panel_006~2_narration=<hook> takes a cursory look around. The damage of their fight mixes with the beerstained flotsam of the brigands' misuse.
~01~~panel_007~4_hook=Good solid building. Look into hiring a strong hand or two. Those brigands left some gear. Learn to use it.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=The burial is hasty, but not ill meaning.
~01~~panel_008~3_npc2=<monster.mf:He/She/They> deserved less from us, I'd say.
~01~~panel_008~4_npc=We [i]are[] grateful.
~01~~panel_009~1_hook2=<hook2.coward/goofball/greedy/loner/snark/60:I'll say this... [face:interested]You were brave to last through it./[face:skeptical]Alright, it's fine. I'm trying to find something funny to say. Just... Alright, just.../We'll be back this way, perhaps. Then, you can show your gratitude in a feast, and an endless tap. [i]Until[] then.../[face:skeptical]I'm not big on these sorts of things. It's grim work. Still, I'll say.../[face:skeptical]Look, it's not my style to trade praise and things of that nature. So, just.../You both did what you had to, to survive. You did well.> May good fortune fold over you, your business, your lives.
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=The road going home is easier than it was coming abroad.
~01~~panel_011~5_hook=<hook.personality:Recall the outset of this journey? The plan was to refresh our eyes, our thoughts./[face:interested]I didn't honestly want it to be like this. We were supposed to go and just relax./[face:joy]If you'd kicked me in the shins, and we'd never left town, we'd have been happier. Why'd we go, again?/This all started [face:skeptical]because I wanted to avoid work, you know that? We were supposed to just coast. Wouldn't that've been nice?/I keep thinking about... we were taking a trip to try and heal ourselves. Weren't we? Or at least have a moment of forgetfulness./Remember how we set out? Like a couple idiots, I guess./Yeah, you know, it's on me. It all has been. Trying to avoid work. Would've been nice, though./I would've liked it. Lucaria Valley. Isolated and green. Wouldn't you have liked it?/Destiny's something that enters my mind, every so often. Remember how we set out? Just a leisurely journey, it was supposed to be./[face:sad]Remember leaving? We were supposed to go somewhere beautiful. Lucaria Valley. I wanted to, anyway./[face:dubious]So what'd you think? Wasn't that a nice trip?> To take our minds off things?
~01~~panel_011~6_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:You wish we hadn't chosen to help?/[face:neutral]Yeah. Yep. /[face:happy]Ah, love.../==>
~01~~panel_012~5_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:neutral]No, that's not it. Just wish we... had more time./[face:interested]Oh well. <hook.personality2:Didn't work out, this time. Back to our studies and stills, and maybe, next <season>, we'll make the trip in full./Makes me think about retirement, until I realize... being one of those roadstop owners... that life'd frighten me [i]more[]./All my efforts at dodging destiny... \nstill it ends up punching my eye./Have to guard our hearts from too much caring. Too much giving. It all ends up in blood and dirt./Shattered bones, splintered lives, swollen eyes, sliced open skin. All wounds paid out are debts we someday must deliver on. Even death./[face:joy]Now I wish we'd asked for a keg-along. A smelly dark stout./I'd rather dodge destiny. But there's really only one true end. No one gets away from it./One more ugly star in the sky. An ox-shouldered star./This work that hurts us... it'll always draw us in, I suspect./I hope the legends are kind to us./What's more blood on our hands?>/[face:neutral]Sometimes I miss you. Across a campfire, and I miss you./==>

~01~~panel_014~2_narration=Toasts to the names <hook> and <hook2> are shared in warm light on a cold night, by those who know them, and those who never will.
