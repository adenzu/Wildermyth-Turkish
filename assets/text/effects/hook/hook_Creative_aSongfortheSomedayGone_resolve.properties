~01~~panel_001~2_hook2=To my eyes, it's all clear.
~01~~panel_001~3_hook=Same here. Nothing moving.
~01~~panel_002~1_hook=Well, that was sudden.
~01~~panel_003~1_hook=<hook2.personality:[face:skeptical]Yeah, I suppose these things don't surprise me much anymore./[face:joy]What, are you embarrassed they heard you sing?/[face:dubious]/[face:skeptical]Seems like we'll survive another night.../[face:happy]Nothing too serious./[face:dubious]You worry me sometimes.../[face:interested]Yeah, I suppose we should.../[face:joy]Too true.../[face:happy]Yeah... yeah./[face:skeptical]Seems like we'll survive another night.../[face:dubious]>
~01~~panel_004~1_hook2=<hook2.personality:[face:interested]Sudden, but not unexpected. Recall how far out we are./[face:skeptical]Yeah, wonder how long they were creeping around us?/[face:interested]I didn't think your singing was [i]that[] bad./[face:joy]/[face:interested]Sudden, but we handled it. You alright?/[face:joy]Bit of exercise before bed, that's all!/[face:skeptical]It's worrisome. We should pass on word to the locals, when we leave this place./[face:skeptical]Hard to have a quiet camp these days.../[face:interested]All things flock to fire./[face:joy]/[face:joke]I suppose you're still bored.>
~01~~panel_005~2_hook=You know, I am glad we came out here.
~01~~panel_006~1_hook=But let's be on the road at dawn.
~01~~panel_007~1_hook2=Yeah?
~01~~panel_008~1_hook=When you sang, and when I sang with you...
~01~~panel_009~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:...I was struck by how long it had been since we'd done something together. Just shared something, you and me./I started thinking that, really, the most powerful, most [i]original[] things... They're old, they grow with you./I considered that word I tend to think of all the time: [i]inspiration[]. It's like a well./---->
~01~~panel_010~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:joy]So I guess anything's still possible!/[face:happy]Like good friends, and songs remembered./[face:happy]This well inside you will always fill and empty. It's fine, but... I want to live for the lasting things. Like love. And old, well-worn songs./---->
~01~~panel_011~1_hook2=In the morning, they will simply start home.
