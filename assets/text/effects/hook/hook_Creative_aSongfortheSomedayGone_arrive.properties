.name=Event
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=So, what do you think of <site>?
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook2=<hook.poet.60:Why doesn't it surprise me you wanted to come to a place called <Site>?/Is that what this place is called?>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook=They say the brave who come here shall learn of themselves deepest truth.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook2=<hook2.coward/goofball/leader/romantic:The brave...? Why the brave? Don't you find that a little ominous?/Well, one thing I've learned is to mistrust your vacation ideas./Well. I guess I can get behind that./I admit, that's a beautiful idea. As long as the truth is what you'd like to know.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook2=<hook.hothead/healer/snark:I'm trying to stay upbeat about this, but.../It's alright. Maybe it just takes a while./So... found any deepest truth yet?>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook2=...the day dies, sun falls away, and in the night they build a fire...
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_hook2=<hook2.poet/romantic/60:I think I understand./I've done that kind of searching myself./Is that really something you can search for?>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=I don't know what I expected to find. I think I'm mostly looking for a feeling.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_hook2=<hook2.goofball/snark/60:There's a fire here. We could make something exciting happen./I guess we always come back to boredom, in the end./Hmm. >
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook=Remember when we were new at this? Everything was new. Each path we took, and every labor we put ourselves to? I'm... bored.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_hook2=[i]Tell me of sorrow, this rose that you kept, \nBy the bed in which last your poor <hook.awm:Isabel/Ansel> slept.[]
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hook=...that song...
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_hook=[i]<hook.awm:She/He> woke full of laughter and brightly <hook.awm:she/he> gazed,\nThe curve of <hook.awm:her/his> mouth in a kiss <hook.awm:she/he> upraised.[]
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_hook=[i]<hook.awm:She/He> sang 'Over the hills peeks a shy but sure dawn,\nAnd sure as the sunrise, I'll someday be gone.\nBut recall me in love, and our joy may live on,'\nAnd you do, and you do, and you dooo...[]
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_narration=The old love song is one <hook.mf:he's/she's/they've> sung a hundred times by a fire, a hundred times with a friend, and still...
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_hook=Tonight it feels new.
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_hook=How strange.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:joke]Are you kidding? Everyone knows that's my song. [i]I[] sing it best!/[face:happy]Me too. <hook2.healer/poet/hothead/snark:Whenever you sang it, I felt a little sad, but a little bit lighter, also./Songs don't need to be new. Like homes. A song can be a kind of home./Even if I don't quite get it./Even if it's a bit maudlin for my taste...>/[face:happy]I suppose we each thought of each other, and what it would be like to have to go on alone./--->
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]But I didn't know you knew that one./I always did love that song./[face:happy]Song always broke my heart a little, when we sang it together./--->
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_narration=A noise rises in the darkness. Not an echo of them, but the resonant call of something else.
~01~prompt~panel_024~2_hook=Did our voices wake the neighbors?
~02~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook2=Well, there's been some run-ins out here. Stick by the fire. Maybe it's nothing.
~03~choice_one~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.hothead.60:<hook.whm:If there's something out there, better to strike first./If we're being hunted, I say we turn the snare on our enemy./Only a fool waits in the open for lightning to strike...>/[face:grim]I don't like waiting to get ambushed. Let's look around.>
~03~choice_one~panel_001~2_self=[b]<hook.eventRoll:roll_one|difficulty_one>
~04~player_chose_no~panel_001~1_hook=They stand back to back, and at the rim of the firelight, a foe emerges...
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~1_hook=Leaving the firelight, they circle around through some trees. They spot their foes entering the camp, well-illuminated.
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_001~1_hook=They circle around, until they hear a noise in their camp, and return to find it looted. Then their foe closes in around them.
