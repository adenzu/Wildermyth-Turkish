~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=It's an awkward, quiet trek. Many of the shortcuts <legend> seems to know well are unfamiliar to <hook2>.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... <legend.mf:He's/She's/They're> hiding something. <legend>'s playing some other game of <legend.mf:his/her/their> own.../But think about it, doesn't something feel off? Like when <hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer:the exact book you're looking for was checked out the day before/you hear a sudden echo to your footsteps/the eggs are too chewy/your luck suddenly falls as the bid rises/a peppy old miser suddenly keels over>?

And it's daytime?>/<hook2.personality:Speaking hypothetically, would you say that what I don't know won't hurt me?/[face:sad]We met this way, didn't we? Journeys and completions? Finding courage in each other? I understand if.../[face:happy]You're cute, honestly. And I don't care if you have a wandering eye, I just want to... I don't know. Wander with you, maybe./[face:grim]I don't care if it makes me selfish. I'm not going to just let some other [i]<legend.mf:guy/woman/person>[] steal you from me./[face:happy]Look, I'm not mad, really. I just think you'll follow your eyes anywhere. And sometimes you need someone to watch where you step./[face:grim]I'll just say this, there's plenty of <hook2.awm:women/men> out there \nwho would [i]love[] to take a [i]trip[] with me./[face:happy]Look, you are who you are, <hook>. I knew that already. And I can handle whatever you throw at me, but.../[face:grim]I don't really know how to handle this./[face:interested]It's natural for us. <hook.mf:<hook2.mf:Men, even women./Women and men both./Everyone, people of all genders.>/<hook2.mf:Men and women./Women and men./Everyone, people of all genders.>> But honesty matters to me, <hook>, and trust. I'm not necessarily saying.../[face:sad]I just feel like... I want to be the one that gets your blood going. Even still. I don't want [i]us[] to lose [i]our[] fire./[face:dubious]Oh, really? All this time on the road? You and <legend.mf:he/she/they> would've been playing cards and discussing weather-patterns?>/--->

Well I wouldn't believe you./[face:joke]Perhaps you don't understand the chase, <hook2>.../[face:joke]The jealousy is fogging off you so thick it's giving me pimples./[face:talking]I don't think that's the case at all. <legend.mf:He's/She's/They're> just smitten with me. Nervous./[face:angry]Maybe you should focus on your own cold empty heart, [i]friend[]./[face:talking]Love is a war, didn't you know that, <hook2>? I'm a veteran of such fights.../[face:grim][i]You're[] the one I trust least./[face:joke]And the gray pigeon must slander the golden eagle's flight!/[face:joke]Passion and play. The [i]Chase[], <hook2>! You don't understand it./[face:joke]Because you're [i]exactly[] who I would trust to tell me about love.>/[face:grim]Because [i]you[] made it weird. [i]You[] did./<hook2.personality:Well... isn't that [i]hypothetically[] true?/[face:sad]<hook2>, I'm sorry. Please don't worry./[face:surprised]What do you mean by that?/[face:grim]<hook2>, it's not... [i]like[] that./[face:skeptical]Well... what do you mean?/[face:happy]Oh, I know. Especially when you get that look in your eye./[face:grim]You're taking it too seriously./[face:sad]<hook2>... There's nothing to handle. Just, I was a little shaken?/[face:grim]I know, I know. I honestly didn't have a plan to be... you know. To go [i]far[]./[face:happy]<hook2>, truly. I burn for you as strongly as I ever did. I'm just.../[face:skeptical]Might've played dice.

~01~prompt~panel_005~3_action=[red]cree, cree!
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_legend=We're here!
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_action=[actionSmall][red]creh
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_narration=The thick line of forest rises before them. Not clearly menacing, nor even remarkable. Birds and squirrels and the things inbetween make their sunset sounds.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_legend=They've got my brother in there. Better let me go on alone. I know these woods. You come when I call.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_action=[red][actionSmall]woosh.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook2=I'm not letting <legend.mf:him/her/them> out of my sight.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~2_narration=Follow <legend> into the forest.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~2_narration=Wait for <legend>'s signal.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~4_hook=I trust <legend.mf:him/her/them>. Come on, let's wait. Poke around the ruins.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~1_legend=...<hook> and <hook2> creep through the trunks, staying quiet as possible, shadowing <legend>'s winding course.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~1_hook=You really are ridiculous.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~2_hook2=Just... give it a moment.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~1_legend=Well? Hello? Anyone there?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~1_action=[actionSmall]swiff
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_004~2_action=[actionSmall]thwsh
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~2_legend=Don't tell me this was for nothing...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_005~3_hook2=[small][gray]Someone left a chest here...
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_006~2_speech=[gray]Ey. Sclrr. Oo lone?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_007~1_legend=Oh...!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_007~2_speech=[gray]Sclec.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_008~1_hook=Drau--!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_008~2_hook2=Shh! Watch.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~1_legend=Why are you sneaking up on [i]me?[]
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_009~2_speech=[gray]Sclac! Late comink. Deed oo brink. Sclac-ac! Slabes?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_010~1_legend=Yeah, there's <volunteer.exists:three/two> of them out by the near ruins. Don't pretend your bird didn't clock them. They're waiting for my signal, and won't expect an attack if you're fast. Hand over the coin.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_011~1_legend=That wasn't our agreement!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_012~1_speech=[gray]Disc-metal yers when capsherd they.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_013~1_legend=The Drauv slaps its own snout and splutters.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_013~2_speech=[gray]Sclac-slerc! Thass rait. Ar meestake. Sclerc. Ere's coin fer oo.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_014~1_narration=The silent one drops a dirty sack of money in <legend>'s palms. <legend.mf:He goes/She goes/They go> on <legend.mf:his/her/their> way.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_014~2_narration=<hook><volunteer.exists:, <hook2>, and <volunteer>/ and <hook2>> have just been sold to Drauven slavers!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_015~1_hook=Perfect.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_015~2_hook2=You okay?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_016~1_action=[maroon][actionSmall]creh?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_016~2_action=[actionSmall][maroon]fwoop.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_017~1_action=[actionLarge][maroon]cree!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_017~2_hook2=Get ready!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~1_hook2=I'm telling you, whatever you [i]think[] will happen, you're going to be disappointed.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~2_hook=Maybe.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~1_hook=Disappointment isn't the worst thing. Better to chase something and not catch it than to spend your life stagnant and wondering...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~1_hook2=<hook.personality:And that's your approach, is it?/For someone so prone to worry, you, well.../That explains a lot./And who cares what anyone thinks, right?/It's certainly an optimistic position./That's what you think? No wonder!/You believe that, huh?/For someone so quiet, you, well.../How much time did you spend on that little gem?/That sounds nice. I do wonder if it works out./You're being serious, aren't you?> <hook.rfln.hook2:[face:joy]You're a fool, but at least you know it./[face:dubious]So that's what this is, I guess?/[face:grim]Well what do you [i]really[] want? And does it include me?/--->
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~2_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:And I'm not sure that makes it better.../Yeah. If I thought about it that hard./Of course it does. But it also includes.../--->
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~2_hook=Oh! [i]There's[] something.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~1_action=[red][actionSmall]plick
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~2_hook=Hm?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~3_narration=<hook> stoops to pick up a small relic half-buried in the rubble.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_008~4_hook2=Uh, hey, <hook>. Here's a wild theory.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_009~1_hook=That's oddly specific.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_010~1_hook2=What if this was all a ploy to get us to stand out here defenseless, and <legend> was just going to sell us to some Drauven slavers, and they've each got swords?
