~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=[gray]...where am I?
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook=[gray]...am I blind?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook=Uh... Am I alone?

~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook=A flame flares. <hook2> carefully sets down a small copper lamp. The shock of the light is its own kind of blindness.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hook=As <hook>'s eyes adjust, <hook.mf:he sees/she sees/they see> the prison that surrounds them. Earthen walls, crude bars of barely shorn boughs...
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/snark/60:Now this's interesting. Who's responsible for it?/Tell me this isn't as bad as it looks./[face:joke]All to get me alone, huh?

~01~prompt~panel_007~4_hook2=Cultists. <random:[face:skeptical]Could've killed us, caged us instead./You know, the Deep-seeking ones./Plucked us up like a pair of grubs./Rock-scratchers, bull worshippers.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hook2=Left us with this lamp and a little oil. I guess they plan to let us waste away? Not sure what else.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook2=<hook2.bookish/hothead/poet/60:There's a simple, sadistic genius in the message./[face:angry]They're mocking us.

~01~prompt~panel_009~2_hook=Yeah.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hook=Well the bars are wood, so...
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_hook2=Tried it.
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_hook=You tried the...?
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook2=<hook2.bookish/goofball/healer/leader/snark/60:Cage is oddly impervious. I'm sure the explanation is dissatisfying./[face:neutral]Actually, it's kind of fun. You can beat against the cage and it won't even shiver./Hate to say it, but this has to be enchantment. Wood can't even be scarred./I had the same reaction. It looks flimsy. But the wood... I don't know./[face:dubious]It's the usual thing: unexplainable forces seal our prison. You know./I've never seen wood like this.

~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hook2=That's all I can think of is to dig. But without food, doubt we'll get anywhere.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_hook=And I guess these earth walls...?
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hook=Hm. Yeah. Uh, but our captors... Do they come by? Have they?
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_hook2=At least once, while I was awake. I slept some. Don't know how long.
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_hook=<hook.personality:I'd like a glimpse at them. Facets of this situation feel disjointed. Misaligned./[face:grim]We're doomed.

[i]You[] missing anything?/How're [i]you[] doing? Have you been alright?/[face:grim]They left us our weapons./Have any idea how long we've been down here?/[face:neutral]Oh. That's alright./[face:grim]The hopes of a caught hawk turn to its jailer. Hm./[face:grim]Wonder if they want me to marry their leader./[face:joke]Well... good job doing the exposition, at least.>
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_hook2=<hook.personality:Maybe. Or maybe it's not more complex than... uh. Wanting us dead?/Not [i]doomed[]. Maybe. Or we can't be sure, I mean./[face:dubious]I wonder... if I should've appreciated the quiet better.../[face:dubious]Sunlight. Fresh air. Hope? But aside from those things.../<hook.rfln.hook2:Uh, sure. You're the one that's been out./I'm mostly fine. You've been out, and that's really what I was worried about./No. I wasn't sure if you'd... besides, I'm just focusing on the situation. Take your time./==>/You feel insulted, don't you?/Not really. I've been conscious... maybe two days? At most?/[i]What's[] alright?/Oh. What do you mean?//[face:dubious]Thanks. This was a long one.>
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_hook=Well, and it's... <hook.personality2:I [i]am[] curious about the circumstances, the motivations, and.../I'm tired. It's, no, I'm [i]alive[], I guess, so there's... But.../[face:happy]It'll just be kind of funny if... I don't know. Sorry./We're here, we're armed and we have our stuff. We have [i]some[] time./I suppose, looking on the bright side, we're alive. Life gives us a chance./[face:happy]And then part of me's sort of excited. Is that stupid? Like we've been given a challenge./Alright, well, the main thing to do is probably to take stock, and make a plan./weird, though. Always thought I'd be good in circumstances like these.[face:grim]/humbling, isn't it? I think I'd begun to believe we were infallible./[face:grim]We don't die here. I feel that. It wouldn't make sense. So we just have to try and.../comical, in a way, I guess. Of all the wild nonsense in the world, this's how we die?> And there's nothing to eat?
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_hook2=Naw. <hook2.personality2:No sustenance has been forthcoming./[face:interested]That's what's making me the most anxious./Just each other, if you want to count that, but.../How much could they even have for themselves?/I know it's a lot to take in. But./[face:dubious]These cow-kissers don't have any honor./Makes me question why they kept us alive in the first place. But./[face:neutral]One of us could survive awhile, eating the other. But./Though the situation must be fluid.../Heroism can only support a heart for so long.../Dirt, if you like that? Might find some bugs?> Seems like we won't be fed.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_hook=Fine, okay. Uh. Any other prisoners? Or just us...?
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_hook2=<hook2.bookish/leader/poet:No... prisoners, per se. But there's this thing.../Us and this thing./No one else. Unless you want to count this ancient abomination.>
~01~prompt~panel_022~2_narration=It's nestled there like the body of a brass pill bug, joints crusted with dry earth...
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_narration=...a device of the old Mortificers, mostly intact, but clearly lacking the spark of animation.
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:You scared? Heh./Don't worry, though./Don't worry, love./> Just some old broken bone-a-maton. Long time since it's been working...
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_hook=But this's... this's not nothing. Look at its hands. <hook.bookish.60:Yes... you can see how the different bits were meant to articulate. It's compact, but it looks strong. This [i]isn't[] nothing. Hmm.../Did they plant this here? It looks like it hasn't moved in forever. I'm... getting a scary plan.>
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_narration=Minutes bleed to hours. Coagulate into unguessable chunks. Nights? Days? Dreary. [ni][b]Hungry[][]...

~01~prompt~panel_026~3_narration=<hook2> <hook2.bookish/hothead/leader/loner/romantic/60:scrapes the beginnings of schemes in the dirt. But they're far too elaborate./scars <hook2.mf:his/her/their> moods on the blank hard earth walls./goes between cage and cavewall, dissatisfied with inaction./muses quietly to <hook2.mf:himself/herself/themself>. At one point, finds a spider throwing lines between <hook2.mf:his/her/their> knees./often glances, doleful and curious, back at <hook>. Then tries to imagine how a story-hero would escape./listlessly walks the perimeter of their prison, clear solutions shy to strike <hook2.mf:him/her/them>.>
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_hook=Think I have something...
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_narration=Eventually, <hook2.mf:he comes/she comes/they come> to a conclusion. Fairly simple, but...
~01~prompt~panel_028~2_hook2=You want to talk?
~01~prompt~panel_029~2_hook2=Yeah? Well... <hook2.coward/leader/loner/60:[face:interested]Can I say what I've been thinking?/See what you think of my idea./[face:neutral]I'll come over there, I guess./[face:skeptical]My idea's not advanced, but it might work. >
~01~prompt~panel_030~2_hook2=<hook2.coward/leader/loner/60:Um, so.../And be honest if it sounds stupid, but.../[face:neutral]This's my dumb idea.../So here it is...> We play dead. [i]Very[] convincingly. <hook2.bookish/healer/snark/60:Logically, they've put us here for some purpose. Us being dead disrupts that./There's a fair chance they want us alive./And I don't know, maybe they don't want us to start stinking?/They have to check on us, right?> So when they come in to examine our corpses... we jump them.
~01~prompt~panel_031~3_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]That's all you came up with? It works/I could almost see it working, yeah,/[face:neutral]That's not bad, love. It works/==> as long as they care to remove us in a timely fashion. Which, I don't know.
~01~prompt~panel_032~3_hook=Here's what [i]I'm[] thinking. Look at this old thing's shovel hands.
~01~prompt~panel_034~1_hook=If we can repair it, we have a tool to dig us out. Forces them to either intervene, or let us go.
~01~prompt~panel_035~1_hook=Repairing it, the more I think on it, shouldn't be much harder than... replacing where the old sinew in it's rotted away. And feeding blood into its system.
~01~prompt~panel_037~2_hook2=What?
~01~prompt~panel_038~1_hook=I'm suggesting you cut off my left arm, and we use the tissues to get this old creature working. Then it digs us out.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hook=<hook> and <hook2> play dead and attempt to ambush their captors.

~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=<hook2> amputates <hook>'s arm, and they use the materials to fix the Morthagi digger.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~3_darken=<hook> will lose an arm.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~1_narration=They fall into dead positions and go still.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~2_narration=They let the lamp burn high.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_002~1_narration=The oil ends, the light dims and fails.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_003~1_narration=As agreed from the outset, they lie motionless as possible, shallowing their breaths. They don't speak, don't shift. Who knows how closely they're being watched?
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_003~2_narration=The wait is excruciating. Empty bellies seem to howl, shriek, echo. \nThe inclination to fall asleep grows powerful, spells doom.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_004~1_narration=Hips, spines, shoulders...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_004~2_narration=...ache and stiffen and bruise.

~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010~2_narration=Surely their bodies will betray the ruse?
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010~3_narration=They try not to tense, holding their breaths.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_011~1_narration=With a grunt, one cultist ties a tuft of purple moss to the bars, then lights it with flint and sword. Flaring up, the moss blazes, emits smoke that smells like scorched olives.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_012~1_narration=These unnatural flames burn a portal in the mystic prison.
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_013~2_hook2=Now, <hook>...
~04~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_013~3_narration=Their muscles resist, malnourished and abused. \nThey rise wobbling but brave-faced.
