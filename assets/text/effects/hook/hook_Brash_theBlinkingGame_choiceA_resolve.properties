~01~~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.bookish/greedy/hothead/poet:Well, reading's more annoying now. Books should really flip at the top.../Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry...//I... wonder what I should do when my patch gets sweaty.>
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=By nightfall, <hook>'s eye is patched. A fire <hook.bookish/greedy/hothead/poet:burns under a black iron kettle of perrywort tea, and a book is in <hook.mf:his/her/their> hand./heats a pan full of sizzling trout./blazes as <hook.mf:he/she/they> absently adds more branches./gnaws on logs. <hook.mf:He gazes/She gazes/They gaze> into the flames.>
~01~~panel_002~1_hook=Hmm? Oh, <hook.hothead/leader/snark:I already told you./well thanks for making sure./you didn't believe me?> <legend.mf:He/She/They> wouldn't have stuck around.
~01~~panel_003~1_hook2=I just did one more sweep of the area...
~01~~panel_004~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Alright./Right. Good./That's true./--->
~01~~panel_004~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Alright, next time I won't check./I know you said that, I'm just being sure./Doesn't hurt to be sure./--->
~01~~panel_006~1_hook=Look, I don't know what comes next. <legend> and I... We had our own kind of honor<hook.bookish/leader/poet/snark:, rectitude./. Justice./. Balance./. I call it take for took, snit for snat.> So perhaps... perhaps this was it.
~01~~panel_007~1_hook=<hook2.greedy/healer/poet:I don't know./I mean, if it wasn't... I get it./I'm used to it.> <hook.healer/poet/bookish/60:Things have consequences, you know? The things you do, or don't do.../Things have consequences, you know? The things you do, or don't do.../Things have consequences, you know? The things you do, or don't do.../I've done enough harm to know some's coming back to me.>
~01~~panel_008~1_hook2=<hook2.greedy/healer/poet:And if it wasn't...?/And by 'perhaps' you mean...?/It seems like a big question to live with.>\n\n<hook.rfln.hook2:///--->
~01~~panel_009.(hook_and_hook2_are_rivals)~2_hook2=<hook.healer/leader/60:Are you turning this into a life-lesson? How annoying./Yes, yes, and we all should learn from your example./You seem cool. Stop it.>
~01~~panel_010.(hook_and_hook2_are_friends)~2_hook2=<hook.healer/leader/60:Even I can say you're being way too reasonable about this./Look, I know you're making an effort to be... oh well. Good job./Am I supposed to start taking you seriously now?>
~01~~panel_011.(hook_and_hook2_are_lovers)~2_hook2=<hook.healer/leader/60:But, <hook>... Ah, nothing. You have this amazing spirit in you. I wish you could see it./You really are a surprising <hook.mf:man/woman/person>, aren't you?/Incredible... <hook>'s actually coming across as a mature adult.>
~01~~panel_012~1_hook=<hook.healer/leader/60:I'm handling this really well, aren't I? Is there a prize for that?/I mean, if you want to know the truth, I think I won the game. I didn't back down, did I?/Well, the eyepatch definitely helps, right?>\n\n<hook.rfln.hook2:\n/\n/\n/\n--->
~01~~panel_013.(hook_and_hook2_are_rivals)~1_hook2=<hook.healer/leader/60:There it is./Ock! Pathetic./It... does.>
~01~~panel_014.(hook_and_hook2_are_friends)~1_hook2=<hook.healer/leader/60:Oh. Like what? I don't think there's a stipend. Maybe a breakfast?/There's the <hook> I know.../Somehow, not really...>
~01~~panel_015.(hook_and_hook2_are_lovers)~1_hook2=<hook.healer/leader/60:Oh? There might be.../Alright, maybe not that surprising./It [i]is[] kind of sexy...>
~01~~panel_016~1_narration=<hook.bookish/greedy/hothead/poet:They drink perrywort tea as the night completes itself./They eat crispy-skinned trout and braised mushrooms./The highclimbing fire pours its heat into the night sky./Together they watch the flames dance, until the flames grow shy and shrink into the coals.> Later, they sleep. Neither will ever hear from <legend.fullname> again.
