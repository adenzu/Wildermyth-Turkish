~01~~panel_001~1_hook=Clear on this side.
~01~~panel_001~2_hook2=No movement here.
~01~~panel_002~1_hook=The Drauven? Think they were also here for...?
~01~~panel_002~2_hook2=So what's the story?
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=The spirit darts away again.
~01~~panel_004~2_hook2=<hook2.goofball/healer/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:happy]Kind of want to feed it, right? Looks like it would love crackers./[face:happy]Is it going to give us a seed? That'd be a perfect compromise./[face:dubious]We just keep chasing this little <hook2.mf:guy/lady/guy> around. More Drauven to swat?/[face:skeptical]I doubt it wants [i]us[] here either, you know.../[face:skeptical]What a [i]weird[] dog./[face:talking]You know, it'd be a pretty cute pet...>
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=It's not a long walk to the densest depth of the woods...
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=...where it appears something's been left for them to find.
~01~~panel_007~2_hook=A gift...?
~01~~panel_007~3_hook2=<hook2.greedy.60:[face:happy]Reward, you mean./[face:skeptical]Or an offering. Are we meant to just...?>
~01~~panel_010~2_hook=<hook.coward/greedy/healer/leader/snark/60:[face:skeptical]I hope this is what was meant.../[face:joy]You make a fine bargain, spirit.../Thank you. We'll use it well./[face:grim]We'll use it well./[face:neutral]Well, treeghost... thanks, I guess./[face:neutral]We'll leave you in peace.>
~01~~panel_011~4_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:So... that's it, then?/Well, <hook>, I... I mean I guess this all fine with you, right? \nAre you going to keep looking for...?/So, love, um. You're fine with this?/>
~01~~panel_012~2_hook=Why? Because we're leaving the trees untouched?
~01~~panel_012~3_hook2=Yeah.
~01~~panel_013~2_hook=We went looking for Havenbeams. We found them. But <hook.bookish/greedy/poet/romantic/60:ascertaining what the impact was... Anyway. Knowledge is [i]supposed[] to change your mind./sometimes you have to say no to yourself. I know that. Anyway, didn't leave empty-handed.../where old spirits roost, often you'll find the crux of some larger existence. In balance. You can't disrupt that./can you imagine tearing one of those trees down? I can't. I think we did the heroic thing.../the trees had stood there so long, I think... the spirit, the meaning of the place... anyway. I don't know.>
~01~~panel_014~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]How about <hook2.bookish/goofball/snark:your threat to reproduce/your future army/the coming clan of <hook>s>?/And your future children? You still thinking about that?/[face:skeptical]But... you still do [i]want[] a family?/>

~01~~panel_015~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:happy]They'll have good friends. \nGood friends like you, <hook2>.../Guess I'll have to do my best. And I trust my friends will help keep them safe./[face:skeptical]Well, [i]you[] want kids someday, right...?/>
~01~~panel_015~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]Don't [i]you[]?/>
