~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2.snark/60:It's not like everyone in the world is hoping for more <hook>-clones to be running around. <hook.whm:Swinging sharpened metal around./Shooting an arrow everyplace./Casting a spell on things.>/Want to keep your unborn children safe from everything? Don't have them.>/How're you going to prepare against every kind of bad thing that might happen? <hook.bookish/coward/leader/romantic:I'd be fascinated to know./Not that I haven't had the same thought.../It's a false prospect. More danger in the effort./I agree that if it were possible, I'd...>/Let's be real. Having a family could be a long way off, right? I mean, we just don't know. I'm certainly. I mean. I don't know./--->
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=It's not about that.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook=Call it due diligence. <hook.personality:The more problems you can solve before they sprout, the better./A way to lower my anxiety a little, when the time does come./I have popcorn for a brain. Better for me to do what I'm thinking about while I'm thinking about it./I'm not going to be anyone's ideal <hook.mf:dad/mom/parent>. I know that. But I can do this today.../Whatever I [i]can[] do now. Better to do it now, I think./<hook.mf:Papa/Mama/Mama> Bear's instinct. Even the thought of... just anything hurting my cubs...[face:grim]/When I see something to be done, I have to do it./Who knows if I'll be there to take care of... my kids./Even the cold-eyed birds line their nests in expectation.../A <hook.mf:father's/mother's/parent's> love doesn't have a start or an end./Or please don't, actually, that sounds so cold...>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook2=And Havenbeams... where'd you hear of that? What [i]is[] that?
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2://[face:interested]/>
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_hook=<hook.bookish/loner/poet/60:You keep track of particularly useful legends. Once you see them repeated, you pay more and more attention./Uhhh... A book? Or a person, some time./It's an old story. And there's a song about it, too, I think. These things come on the wind, if you're listening./It's a boring story, kind of. I was visiting someone living out north of <town>. An old acquaintance...>
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_hook=<hook.bookish/loner/poet/60:Havenbeam trees are said to grow in places untouched by fire. Or maybe it's that the trees are there warding off the flames? It's a lizard or egg thing. Well, because the wood of a Havenbeam is supposed to repel danger, according to myths./It's supposed to be a charm, a natural ward against harm. Timbers of havenbeam, built into your home. Oh, also... I think I slept in a grove of trees like that, once. Most peaceful sleep of my life./Yeah, I heard the word and it struck me. The lyrics written about Havenbeam trees say their wood is born with magic in its fibers. Protective magic./Thunderstorm starts up, we're listening to these bolts fall, and I'm lip-biting. It's a high house. But she says, "Don't worry." Points to the rafters. "Havenbeam," she calls the wood. It wards her house. >
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_hook=<hook.bookish/loner/poet/60:So when you build with it, you're essentially warding your home from unforeseen disaster./It might be hill legends. But then, there's often truth in those.../ Build a home with havenbeams, they say it's a powerful defense against ill luck and ill will./Coincidence or not, her house has stood there untouched, through fire, hail, wind, and other things.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_narration=A little woodland spirit decides to make itself known.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_action=[actionSmall][kelly]bree, \n bree!
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_hook=[gray]Shh, hold up!
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_hook2=[gray]I see it...
~01~prompt~panel_009~4_narration=The spirit stands motionless for a moment...
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_narration=...then scampers gone along corridors of root, shadow, and trunk.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hook=<hook.coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/70:[face:surprised]You don't think it's a trick, do you?/[face:joy]It wants us to chase it!/[face:happy]I think we're in luck./[face:angry]It's daring us to follow. Come on./[face:happy]It's leading the way./We following?>
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_hook2=<hook.coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/70:I... guess we follow?/Maybe?/Could be./[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/Uh, well, yeah?>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=They rush after it...
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_narration=...leaping rocks and snags and craggy treefeet...
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_narration=...deeper into the forest...
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_narration=...to arrive at an evergreen grove all combed through with mist.
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_narration=The spirit darts and dances among the skirts of these luminous, perfect trees.
~01~prompt~panel_016~4_hook=Those are them... Havenbeams...
~01~prompt~panel_016~5_hook2=We have to... [gray]cut one down?
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook=I don't know. <hook.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/poet/romantic/snark/60:Suddenly, I'm questioning.../I'd be kind of [i]afraid[] \nto raise an axe here./Much as they \ncall to me.../It's a home for spirits. We're not plunderers, are we?/These wild places... it doesn't feel right, does it?/For some reason my heart shudders and shies.../I don't often say this but... it [i]feels[] wrong./Easy enough to see we're someplace sacred...>
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=The spirit led us here. Sooo... \nWe must have its blessing?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.healer/hothead/loner/60:Apologies, little one./Alright, so tell us, then./Forestling, this place./Hey, so, little spirit.> We, uh... \nWhy did you lead us here?
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~1_action=[kelly]breeee!
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_003~2_narration=<hook>'s confusion won't last long.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.bookish/greedy/hothead/leader/snark/60:Why else would it take us here? The rational explanation is that we're being granted a gift. Right?/[face:talking]Here's the truth. People come first. And the people that [i]I[] care about, they come first to me./[face:angry]I didn't come all the way out here just to balk at the last unseemly step.../[face:talking]Look, you have to do things sometimes that you're not proud of. That's life, that's work, that's sacrifice./[face:talking]Hey, look, I'm not saying I take it lightly. But it's trees. We cut those down all the time, don't we?/I know what you're thinking, that it doesn't seem right to just... but we came all the way out here, didn't we?>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook.bookish/greedy/hothead/leader/snark/60:[face:dubious]You [i]would[] say that./[face:angry]Whatever's [i]yours[]. Don't we all know it./[face:skeptical]But our information's changed./[face:dubious]Yes, you're so noble./[face:dubious]Just your basic trees./[face:dubious]We certainly did.>/You're going to do this?/[face:sad]Love, I don't know.../>
~05~player_chose_no~panel_002~3_hook=Mmm... well.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~1_action=[kelly]breeee!
