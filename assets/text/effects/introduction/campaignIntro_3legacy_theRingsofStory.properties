~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=<town> was one of those places where Rings of Story tend to intersect.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=Or maybe its noteworthy reputation simply attracted noteworthy folk.
~01~prompt~panel_003.(hero_is_Bookish)~1_narration=<hero> soaked in the endless stream of curiosities and discoveries.
~01~prompt~panel_003.(hero_is_Bookish)~2_hero=He said he’d seen one, and the description checks out, but he could have read the book ahead of time...
~01~prompt~panel_004.(hero_is_Coward)~1_narration=<hero> kept a low profile, content to lose <hero.mf:himself/herself/themself> in listening and watching the characters who filled the streets.
~01~prompt~panel_005.(hero_is_Goofball)~1_narration=<hero> happily took the license to loosen <hero.mf:his/her/their> “filter” a bit, especially on slow nights when the square could use a song or two.
~01~prompt~panel_005.(hero_is_Goofball)~2_hero=Don't worry. You’d have to try [i]really hard[] to be the most obnoxious <hero.mf:fellow/lady/person> here.
~01~prompt~panel_006.(hero_is_Greedy)~1_narration=<hero> enjoyed the trinkets and artifacts that floated through town on a slow river of histories.
~01~prompt~panel_006.(hero_is_Greedy)~2_hero=You’re not going to find one of these anywhere else in the Yondering Lands.
~01~prompt~panel_007.(hero_is_Healer)~1_narration=<hero> believed that everyone had a tale worth sharing, and Market Days were the best for browsing and connecting.
~01~prompt~panel_007.(hero_is_Healer)~2_hero=You’d be amazed how quickly people open up when you show a little interest.
~01~prompt~panel_008.(hero_is_Hothead)~1_narration=<hero> took it as a personal challenge to be able to top any story that passed over <hero.mf:his/her/their> plate.
~01~prompt~panel_008.(hero_is_Hothead)~2_hero=Deepmice are annoying, maybe. But they’re hardly the worst thing you can find in the root cellar. This one time...
~01~prompt~panel_009.(hero_is_Leader)~1_narration=<hero> seemed to know everyone, to have their stories straight, and <hero.mf:he/she/they> had a knack for tying those threads together.
~01~prompt~panel_009.(hero_is_Leader)~2_hero=Funny, I was just talking to one of their temple builders last week. I’ll see if she’s still around.
~01~prompt~panel_010.(hero_is_Loner)~1_narration=<hero> took comfort in the anonymity it brought.
~01~prompt~panel_011.(hero_is_Poet)~1_narration=<hero> felt there were important lessons to be learned about humanity by feeling out the edges of so many different stories.
~01~prompt~panel_012.(hero_is_Romantic)~1_narration=<hero> imagined <hero.mf:himself/herself/themself> in the dramas spun out over rolls and roasted birds.
~01~prompt~panel_012.(hero_is_Romantic)~2_hero=All that effort, and you didn’t even [i]ask[] <npc4.awm:her/him/them> afterwards?
~01~prompt~panel_013.(hero_is_Snark)~1_narration=<hero> delighted in finding new rumors to smirk at from behind <hero.mf:his/her/their> mug.
~01~prompt~panel_013.(hero_is_Snark)~2_hero=Told you. Somebody that defensive about their pitchfork? Trouble.
~01~prompt~panel_014.(hero2_is_Bookish)~1_narration=<hero2> was just as content to browse the dense tomes that passed through town, somehow always through <hero2.mf:his,her,their> hands.
~01~prompt~panel_015.(hero2_is_Coward)~1_narration=<hero2> distracted <hero2.mf:himself/herself/themself> with keeping a tidy home and tried not to think too hard about any Rings of Story.
~01~prompt~panel_016.(hero2_is_Goofball)~1_narration=<hero2> liked to see how outlandish a tale <hero2.mf:he/she/they> could tell before somebody would call <hero2.mf:him/her/them> a liar.
~01~prompt~panel_016.(hero2_is_Goofball)~2_narration=Sometimes <hero2.mf:he/she/they> admitted to exaggerating, other times not.
~01~prompt~panel_017.(hero2_is_Greedy)~1_narration=<hero2> would gather interesting passers-through and impress them with extravagant parties.
~01~prompt~panel_017.(hero2_is_Greedy)~2_hero2=<hero2.fullname>’s place! Spread it far and wide!
~01~prompt~panel_018.(hero2_is_Healer)~1_narration=<hero2>’s house was a haven for any who felt adrift, overwhelmed, or needed an ear while they figured out their own life paths.
~01~prompt~panel_019.(hero2_is_Hothead)~1_narration=<hero2> had already gained a reputation for mettle beyond <hero2.mf:his/her/their> years and could be found at the center of <town>’s rowdier endeavors.
~01~prompt~panel_020.(hero2_is_Leader)~1_narration=Those who felt adrift would ask <hero2> for advice. Something about the way <hero2.mf:he/she/they> spoke made conflicts seem petty and solutions seem obvious.
~01~prompt~panel_021.(hero2_is_Loner)~1_narration=<hero2> passed most days in a stone cottage on the outskirts, figuring any necessary news would find its way to <hero2.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~prompt~panel_022.(hero2_is_Poet)~1_narration=<hero2> kept one eye above the rooftops, watching for hints of myths yet untold.
~01~prompt~panel_023.(hero2_is_Romantic)~1_narration=<hero2>, despite the goings-on, still dreamt of distant mountain views and ruin-wandering spirits.
~01~prompt~panel_024.(hero2_is_Snark)~1_narration=<hero2> noted that at least people kept busy enough that they weren't judging [b]<hero2.mf:him/her/them> []life choices all the time.
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_narration=<hero3.personality:And <hero3> stored away everything <hero3.mf:he/she/they> saw, hoping to turn it into <hero3.mf:his/her/their> own legend one day./<hero3>, on the other hand, wasn’t even sure how <hero3.mf:he/she/they> ended up here. But packing up and moving sounded like a lot of work./[hero3.face:happy]<hero3> always chuckled off any talk of destinies. <hero3.mf:He was/She was/They were> here for the sticky-bun stalls./And <hero3> knew deep down that if a path to legend could be found anywhere, it would start here./<hero3> felt a loyalty to the town, but <hero3> could probably develop loyalty to a garbage heap if you let <hero3.mf:him/her/them> think about it for a few minutes./And <hero3> knew deep down that if a path to legend could be found anywhere, it would start here./<hero3> felt a loyalty to the town, but <hero3.mf:he was/she was/they were> a loyal sort of person in general./And then there was <hero3>, whose thoughts wandered like vultures on the wind. If <hero3.mf:he/she/they> had opinions, they were hard to pin down./<hero3>, however... <hero3.mf:he was/she was/they were> waiting, sniffing destiny on the air./<hero3>, however... <hero3.mf:he was/she was/they were> waiting, sniffing destiny on the air./<hero3>, on the other hand, wasn’t even sure how <hero3.mf:he/she/they> ended up here.
