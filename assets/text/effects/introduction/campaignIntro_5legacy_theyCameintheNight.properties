Let's bite their legs off.>/I'll turn it our will, don't you worry. Now's the time to pick up our feet, though./They may not shine to our eyes, but there're stars behind the clouds and smoke. Let's go. No rest, now./A carrion-call goes up, even in the dark. Black eyes open. We should let our feet fly./Unless you want to see the black bones of another town, I suggest you move quick./<hothead.personality:[i]"Inimitable, the red smile of terror. Irrevocable, the vow that rose in <hothead.mf:his/her/their> chest, to strike it from Earth's face."[]/[face:sad]Always when we're tired, when we press hard, we're rewarded with waiting violence.../[face:interested]Don't suppose it's a welcoming party, do you? Maybe they've heard we're coming? Maybe there's bean-pie and brown beer.../By the time we get there, it'll just be charity work.

Let's be fast./[face:angry]<foes.cdgmt:Those deepwads got there first./Drauven. I'd bet my life on it./Gorgonbeasts, I'd wager.

Maybe [i]we[] bring the horrors with us./We'll get there and find out it's a festival, right? Two bonfires and a feast of boar? Oh well. I'm hungry, anyway.[face:skeptical]>>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=They come by the road in the glowless hours, five heroes journeying together. \nThis Yondering Land has fallen into trouble, boiling in its fear and grief and doubt.

~01~prompt~panel_004~1_narration=<randomA:A new legend will be born soon after.../Like planets plucked from disparate skies.../Now one mouth sings, now another joins in...>
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_narration=<randomA:...and season by season, new mysteries \nlike breath blow through it./...legends find cause to wander their paths together,\nbe strengthened, each in the other's gravity./...and voice by voice, a heroes' harmony takes shape.\nGains strength.

Isn't that the saying?/[face:skeptical]Look, I'm going to want a drink after this. We [i]all[] are. Let's make sure we have a place to find one./[face:talking]Look before you swing.

I'm going to find cover./[face:grim]Good guess when you find a town with a tavern this size... it's more than a drinking hall. It's their whole community. This's what we should protect./[face:happy]They'll know my name in this building, here. Not only for my deeds tonight, but for the cups I'll drain and kisses I'll win. All of us agree? We fight!/[face:skeptical]Not to be self-serving, but if we manage to pull through, we're going to be pretty annoyed if the beer's all spoiled.>/[face:neutral]This building looks the most defensible.

~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_coward=<coward.personality:Logic dictates that we keep the supply safe. Whatever damage the fire leaves, these materials will be essential in patching it over./[face:interested]Have to figure they won't all come here at once. We should have a better chance of fighting them off, right?/My mouth's dry. [face:interested]Why didn't we pick the tavern?/[face:skeptical]This stuff's necessary if they've got to rebuild. Plus, I mean, if the town burns, we can at least salvage what they had here.../It'll be no good saving a few buildings if no one's got the food and supply to last the rest of the season, or rebuild what they've lost.../[face:angry]I've been in a town that went hungry when their supplies burned. You don't want to see how ugly it gets./[face:grim]If we keep these materials safe, rebuilding will be that much easier. Disastrous if it all goes up, so stay watchful.../[face:neutral]Right. People become beasts when they're starving. The food is what will matter most to them./Best to fight the flames where they're hottest.[face:grim]/[face:angry]We stand against flame and foe, indomitable. Let's send the shadows back to their holes!/[face:skeptical]Weird place to make a stand, isn't it? But I guess if all this goes up, there'll be nothing to rebuild with...>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~2_volunteer=<volunteer.personality:Without their symbols, societies quickly crumble. Let's be certain they can rally here, find something to believe in, when the burning's abated./[face:interested]It feels like... if we let this burn, it would bode ill for everyone. Right?/[face:happy]It's such a cute little fir. You can't help but love it./[face:skeptical]Not that I believe in all the shrine-stuff we find, but these traditions [i]do[] matter. It's bad luck to let a spirit's home burn./It's hard to see now, maybe, but this little tree's survival will help a lot of sooty faces find smiles again.[face:talking]/Trust me, I've let down my share of spirits, and helped a few out in my time. A blessing will come of this./A symbol of enduring, a shrine to willful spirits. This little tree will help them rally, and bring blessings long after tonight./[face:neutral]Honestly, it's the most important thing here./[face:grim]These trees are the center of belief for towns like this, the roots from which, even in the face of destruction, new resolve springs./I'm not sure it's the right choice, but it feels like... symbols must survive. For belief to last, for the town to find its feet again. Let's protect it, if we can./[face:grim]If I die here, please tell my tree... that I loved it...>
