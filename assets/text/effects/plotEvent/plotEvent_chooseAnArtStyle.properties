~01~prompt~panel_002~1_bookish=I'm super interested in learning about 3D lighting and shadows.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_poet=I want to draw awesome monsters and heroes. And I hate working in 3D.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_bookish=I also want to stay married.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_poet=This takes a really long time to draw.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_bookish=I can't figure out how we're going to piece it together procedurally.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_snark=I want to write carefully crafted stories for our characters.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_bookish=But our characters are randomly generated... Each one might be male or female.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_bookish=ok I'll figure out how to make it work.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_narration=(context: now we have this system of tags that lets us control how text shows for various characters.)
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_snark=Awesome. Now can I put tags inside tags?
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_bookish=I'm not really an audio person, and I'm super-busy with all the programming.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_poet=Neither am I but we need some sounds, right? At least a few.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_bookish=If only there was some way we could exchange money for sound effects...
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_poet=Hey it's a beautiful day, wanna take a walk?
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_bookish=[b]I'M WORKING![]
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_narration=(context: should you build your own game engine?)
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_bookish=[large][i]It was a mistake OK?[][]
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_bookish=[small][i]Oooohhhh, Ahhhhhhh[][]
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_snark=I'm gonna write [b][i]all[][] the stories!
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_bookish=Oh we could talk about mortal choices and heroic deaths!
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_bookish=Or about time pressure and encouraging risky play...
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_bookish=Or about, risk aversion, save scumming, and replayability...
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_poet=We don't have time to talk about this.
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_bookish=Time Units.
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_poet=Hard to Convey to the Player
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_snark=Two Actions.
~01~prompt~panel_030~1_party=Click to Attack.
~01~prompt~panel_031~1_bookish=Who asked you? Who even are you?
~01~prompt~panel_032~1_bookish=Fine.
~01~prompt~panel_033~1_bookish=If we don't finish it...
~01~prompt~panel_034~1_poet=We'll have to admit it to our friends and family.
~01~prompt~panel_035~1_bookish=No choice.
