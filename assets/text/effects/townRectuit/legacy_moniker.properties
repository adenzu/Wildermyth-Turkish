~01~~panel_001~1_party=I came to town looking for someone to help against the <foes.plural>, and folks invariably told me to go talk to <volunteer>.
~01~~panel_001~2_volunteer=Well, you've found <volunteer.mf:him,her,them>.
~01~~panel_002~1_party=You've got quite the reputation around here. They call you <volunteer.personality:The Youngest Sage of <town>/The Eagle Eye of <town>/The Laughing <volunteer.whm:Hurricane/Lightning-Strike/Thunderclap>/Merchant of Death/The Steadfast Heart of <town>/The Rabble-Rouser of <town>/Rudder of <town>/The Silent Strike of <town>/The Prophet of <town>/Gleaming <volunteer.weaponType:Blade/Blade/Meteor/Spear/Arrow/Bolt/Blade/Spire/Spark> of <town>/The Salty Soldier of <town>>.
~01~~panel_003~1_volunteer=<volunteer.personality:Ehh, sagacity's not some magic power. Pay attention and do a little reading, and you're miles ahead of most folks./It's well-earned. The trick is to take your fear, and channel it into awareness. Way more productive./[face:joke]Well, I thought about being the Sulky <volunteer.whm:Hurricane/Lightning-Strike/Thunderclap>, but that didn't sound like any fun./[face:grim]Yeah well, business is booming these days, thanks to the <foes.plural>./[face:interested]They do? I'll be honest with you, I probably don't deserve that. I haven't been the one out there facing down foes./[face:dubious]Not my fault the rabble is so easily roused./Say things with confidence, try not to be wrong [i]too[] often, and people tend to listen to you./[face:grim]Spend enough time on the outskirts, people will call you all sorts of things.... That one's not so bad, though./[face:grim]Tell people what they want to hear, they call you Hero. Tell them the truth, they call you Prophet and then clear out when you enter the tavern./[face:happy]Ah. Well, when the evening light catches just so, they're not wrong./[face:dubious]And you're going on that? You know, they call the village cat "Killer," but I don't see you recruiting [i]him[].>
~01~~panel_004~1_party=My point is, if you've got any kind of edge in battle, we could use another <volunteer.whm:brawler on the field/tracker and fighter/fighter with the knowledge of interfusion>.
~01~~panel_005~2_volunteer=<volunteer.snark/coward/bookish/healer/leader/loner/poet/goofball/80:[face:skeptical]Alright... but trust me, you're gonna wish you'd picked the cat./I could... maybe handle that./I'll offer what I can to the cause./This town has been kind to me. And if I can fight for anything, I can fight for that./I'll offer what I can to the cause./[face:skeptical]Hm. And I could probably use the sense of perspective./And I could probably use the sense of perspective./[face:happy]How convenient, [i]I[] was just thinking I could use a change of scenery./[face:skeptical]How convenient. [i]I[] was just thinking I could use a change of scenery.>
~01~~panel_006~1_volunteer=Give me a day or two to get my things in order, and then I'll head out with you.
