That it's worse than we thought?/Trawling the streets again, looking to bring another fresh face to the campfire?/Are we really looking for fighters? Or did you just want an excuse to hit the tavern?>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hero=Come on. <hero.poet/snark/hothead/healer/coward/goofball/greedy/romantic/80:A world-spanning battlesong needs as many verses as it can get./You don’t like the idea of an underling?/You don’t like the idea of an underling?/We may find someone who’ll save your life one day.

~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hero=<ship.rfln.hero3:Plus, I would like someone else to talk to while you and <hero3> are bickering over camp layouts./Plus, I would like someone else to talk to while you and <hero3> are making up new verses to "Old Bella's Hatchet."/Plus, I would like someone else to talk to while you and <hero3> are making flutter-eyes at each other./Plus, I'd like some extra help starting conversations when you and <hero3> are doing that awkward silence thing.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_narration=The stars were beginning to come out by the time they got back into <town> proper.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hero=Good thing we got in when we did. Looks like most people are still out and about.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hero=Maybe we can knock out this errand sooner rather than later.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_volunteer=Wait, you're back? Already?
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_volunteer=You wiped them out that quickly? Or...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_volunteer=<volunteer.hothead/coward/80:[face:angry]/[face:scared]/[face:grim]>You didn't give up, did you?
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hero=<hero.goofball/hothead/snark/coward/poet/loner/80:[face:joke]Pff, what do you take us for?/[face:grim]Pff! What do you take us for?/[face:dubious]Pff.

My stomach knotted there for a minute./[face:joke]Oh, good. If the <foes.plural> were too overwhelming for fighters with [i]outfits[] and [i]gear[], the rest of us would be in big trouble./[face:interested]Good. That would have been distressing news.>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hero=What about you? You look… <volunteer.personality:intelligent/alert/spirited/ambitious/virtuous/intimidating/upstanding/observant/honorable/valiant/clever>.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hero=Actually, we’re back because we’re looking to expand the company.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hero=And you could probably fight with that thing in a pinch, right?
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_volunteer=Probably.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_volunteer=<volunteer.personality:I’m short on experience, but I’ve read notes on historical battles. And such knowledge craves a good use./I gave poor <npc> a pretty good whack when <npc.mf:he/she/they> startled me last week. I still feel bad about it./[face:angry]Here, does this face make it look more intimidating?/[face:skeptical]I’d been trying to make a name for myself as a mason, but a hero’s reputation sounds even better./I’d always thought of myself as a grower or a builder, but I suppose I could, for the right cause./[face:joke]Ask the other tavern regulars, they could tell you./[face:grim]It’s getting clearer that somebody has to./[face:grim]I’ve thought about it sometimes, when I’m out in the <overlandTile.biome>./[face:skeptical]A rocky question with a potential gem of an answer./[face:happy]Defeating a <foes.singular> menace or two would certainly get the butcher’s <volunteer.awm:daughter’s,son’s> attention.../[face:dubious]I’ve taken out a pretty big rat or two, how much harder could a <foes.singular> be?>
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_volunteer=<volunteer.coward/80:But/And> there’s not a lot else keeping me here right now—it’s the season when a young <volunteer.mf:man,woman,person> has to figure out what to make of <volunteer.mf:his,her,their> life.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_volunteer=And this season has brought a lot of changes.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_hero=Can’t argue with you there.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_hero=It would be good to have the help. We’ve learned a bit out in the wilds so far, we can have someone get you up to speed.
