~01~~panel_001~1_party=<leader> and <friend> went into town amid a hum of tension and talk.
~01~~panel_001~2_leader=<town> always this boisterous?
~01~~panel_001~3_npc=<volunteer.fullname>’s just slain a monster!
~01~~panel_002~1_friend=<hero.goofball/snark/hothead/greedy/80:[face:joke] What, and we weren’t invited?/[face:dubious] What, and we weren’t invited?/[face:grim][small]I’ve slain lots of monsters./[face:grim][small]I’ve slain lots of monsters./Something got all the way up here?>
~01~~panel_003~1_npc=Nasty thing was trying to creep up from the <overlandTile.biome>. <volunteer> took care of it, though. It was something to watch.
~01~~panel_003~2_npc2=It was gross!
~01~~panel_004~1_npc=<volunteer.personality:<volunteer.mf:He/She/They> had the air of a practiced <volunteer.whm:warrior/hunter/mystic>. It was like <volunteer.mf:he/she/they> knew exactly where <volunteer.mf:he/she/they> needed to be two seconds before the monster did./<volunteer.mf:He/She/They> had the young and old tucked away before the beast even got close. Gave us a whole "So You've Got a Monster in Town" speech; can't help but think <volunteer.mf:he/she/they> had it rehearsed for such an occasion./That wasn’t just a fight, it was a performance. I swear I saw <volunteer.mf:him/her/them> stop to look back at us and [i]wink[]. Multiple times./That wasn’t just a fight, it was a performance. I swear I saw <volunteer.mf:him/her/them> stop to look back at us and [i]wink[]. Multiple times./<volunteer.mf:He/She/They> had the young and old tucked away before the beast even got close. Very sweet about it though, managed not to scare the children./<volunteer.mf:He/She/They> stood like a vengeful spirit at that gate. Couldn’t help but feel like it was a whole army there./<volunteer.mf:He/She/They> stood unmovable at that gate. Couldn’t help but feel like it was a whole army there./We asked if <volunteer.mf:he/she/they> wanted help, and you’d think we’d offered <volunteer.mf:him/her/them> a rotten fish, the look we got./<volunteer.mf:He/She/They> murmured some proverb about dragonflies, then walked out and annihilated it. I didn’t realize folks like that actually existed./That wasn’t just a fight, it was a performance. I swear I saw <volunteer.mf:him/her/them> stop to look back at us and [i]wink[]. Multiple times./<volunteer.mf:He’d/She’d/They’d> clearly done this sort of thing before. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say <volunteer.mf:he was/she was/they were> [i]bored.[]>
~01~~panel_005~1_leader=Where <volunteer.mf:is he/is she/are they> now?
~01~~panel_005~2_npc=Out by the barns, <volunteer.bookish/goofball/greedy/romantic/loner/hothead/80:taking measurements/cultivating a fan club/cultivating a fan club/cultivating a fan club/trying to deflect all the attention/yelling at kids to stop poking the carcass/keeping kids from poking the carcass>.
~01~~panel_012.(volunteer_is_hothead)~1_volunteer=I see you, <npc>! You're not sneaky!
~01~~panel_013.(volunteer_NOT_bookish/goofball/greedy/romantic/l..._(80))~1_volunteer=<volunteer.poet.80:Hey. <npc>. Back up. Don't need you stirring any vengeful ghosts./You want to use a stick to poke it, fine. But it has to be at least as long as your arm.>
~01~~panel_015.(volunteer_is_bookish)~1_volunteer=Fifty-nine, eighteen, thirty... <npc4>, can you remember that for me?
~01~~panel_015.(volunteer_is_bookish)~2_npc4=Uh...
~01~~panel_016.(volunteer_is_goofball)~1_volunteer=Anyway, a few days' rest, some potent brew, and I'm sure I'll be at the top of my game again.
~01~~panel_017.(volunteer_is_greedy)~1_volunteer=First one's free.
~01~~panel_018.(volunteer_is_romantic)~1_volunteer=Anyway, a few days' rest, some potent brew, and I'm sure I'll be at the top of my game again.
~01~~panel_019.(volunteer_is_loner)~1_volunteer=Oh hey, I've got a... um, monster business. Thing. Sorry, better go.
~01~~panel_020.(volunteer_is_hothead)~1_volunteer=Nobody [i]touch[] it. I’ll know if you did. You’ll get a rash.
~01~~panel_021.(volunteer_NOT_bookish/goofball/greedy/romantic/l..._(80))~1_volunteer=Nobody [i]touch[] it. I’ll know if you did. You’ll get a rash.
~01~~panel_023~1_leader=They’re at <town>, then?
~01~~panel_024~1_volunteer=Well, just the one. So not at the moment. Anymore.
~01~~panel_025~1_volunteer=[white]*sigh*

Fate has other plans./Just when you settle down and get the garden started.

Every time./You make plans, and they get chewed up, huh?/You make plans, and they get chewed up, huh?/I hadn’t wanted it to come to this.>
~01~~panel_027~1_leader=It sounds like you’ve got quite a knack for taking them down, though. We’re looking for that.
~01~~panel_028~1_volunteer=We?
~01~~panel_029~1_leader=<leader.fullname>.
~01~~panel_029~2_leader=<company>.
~01~~panel_030~1_volunteer=I've heard of you.
~01~~panel_031~1_volunteer=<volunteer.fullname>.
~01~~panel_031~2_friend=We've heard of you, too.
