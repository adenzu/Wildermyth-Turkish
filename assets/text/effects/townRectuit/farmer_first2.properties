~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=It didn't take long to trek back to <site>, and the town still seemed like the best bet for finding another able pair of hands.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_actionSmall=*nod*
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_volunteer=Wait!
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_volunteer=It's you!
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_volunteer=From the... heroes?
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_volunteer=The... right. Anyway.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_volunteer=I was hoping you'd come back.
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_hero=<hero.goofball/snark/hothead/greedy/romantic/80:What, did we miss a few <foes.plural>?/What, did we miss a few <foes.plural>?/What, did we miss a few <foes.plural>?/I get that a lot. Everything alright?/I get that a lot. Everything alright?/Everything alright?>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_volunteer=Oh, everything's fine. And that's just it.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_volunteer=It’s been quiet in <site> so far, but I heard those things you said. That talk of <volunteer.personality:treading off the roads and into our own legends/monsters and terror and you know, how it’s bearing down on our very civilization/becoming big, impressive heroes with capes and battleaxes and things/glory and victory… and I’m sure [i]someone[] mentioned treasure at some point/a person’s highest calling—to protect their home and family/not taking any more hog crap from the <foes.plural>/a person’s ultimate duty to protect their home and family/casting off old skins and striking out into the wilderness/linking our hearts into an unbreakable chain of legend/becoming beloved figures of legend/maybe [i]not[] just sitting on our butts while <foes.plural> crawl in through the windows>.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_volunteer=And it stuck with me. More than I would have thought.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_hero=...Is that how we put it?
~01~prompt~panel_012.(ship_exists)~1_ship=Possibly. <ship.goofball/snark/hothead/80:[face:joke]/[face:dubious]/[face:happy]/>Forming a company of heroes can get one a little fired up.
~01~prompt~panel_013.(ship_is_missing)~1_hero=<hero.goofball/snark/hothead/80:[face:joke]/[face:dubious]/[face:happy]/>I suppose forming a company of heroes can get one a little fired up.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_volunteer=You were right, though. <volunteer.personality:It seemed far-fetched at first. But then again, so did the tales of <foes.plural>, and now look where we are./[face:scared]Sitting at home waiting to be devoured or corrupted or somesuch? Didn’t sound like such a solid idea anymore./[face:happy]I assume there’s all manner of horror and squish and fighting for your life too, but shoot. You get to look like an absolute legend while doing it./[face:skeptical]With the biggest risks come the biggest rewards, and I feel ready for a risk bigger than, “which field should the turnips go in this year?”/It’s not enough to lock your doors and wish for peace. Sometimes you have to shoulder the burden of restoring peace yourself./[face:angry]There comes a time when caution and diplomacy just don’t cut it anymore. And then where will you be? Fending off death with a pair of tweezers and a few choice words?/I can’t think of a more timely calling. And such a company is a solid start to beating back any lurking threats./I could leave this life without looking back. Nothing to lose means everything to gain./The woods are darkened with branching peril. But such a company, a family forged in battle, should not be underestimated./You imagine how you want people to remember you. [i]If[] they'll even remember you. And what you’re doing... feels like how I might want to be remembered./[face:dubious]It has a certain spark of sense, if you think about it long enough.>
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_volunteer=<volunteer.personality:\n[face:skeptical]I think I could be useful, but I wasn’t sure about the ah, protocol for joining a company of heroes./\n[face:interested]I don’t know if I could have gotten up the nerve to ask you myself./\n[face:happy]Otherwise I’d have to just awkwardly follow you around until finally you handed me a weapon./\n[face:happy]And I can see you have excellent judgment in recruiting, so that’s a big plus./\n[face:interested]It’s something I might not have done on my own, but I think it’s important./\n[face:joke]Otherwise I’d have to [i]convince[] you, and that’s not something anybody wants./\n[face:grim]There’s a lot still to be done out there./\n[face:skeptical]I’d rather face down a <foes.singular> than another pushy customer in the bakery, anyway./\n[face:happy]After all, when danger drops in, you’d rather have a pair of daggers than two dozen butter knives!/\n[face:joke]Not the most heroic start to a career, having to beg for the job, now is it?/\n[face:skeptical]At the very least, I can be a solid meat shield. We all have to do our part, right?>
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_volunteer=Oh, fantastic! I’m glad you offered.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hero=Well, we could use another fighter on our side. If you’re <party.goofball/snark/hothead:game/game/up for it/interested>.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_hero=Far be it from us to turn you down, then.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_narration=Train <volunteer> as a Warrior
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_narration=Train <volunteer> as a Hunter
