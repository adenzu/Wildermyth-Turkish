~01~prompt~panel_003~1_npc=It's been a year now! To the day!
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_npc=...That I was finally able to get up and walk home!
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc=I owe this leg—and practically this whole year of my life—to you.

~01~prompt~panel_016~1_volunteer=<volunteer.hothead/snark/bookish/poet/50:You know what would be better though? If it hadn’t happened in the first place./You know what would be better though? If it hadn’t happened in the first place./Just mitigating the damage isn’t sustainable. This will keep happening./One sandbag can only do so much against a rising tide./I can’t keep dealing with the fallout, though. What if it’s worse next time?>
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_volunteer=I may be able to <volunteer.leader/hothead/50:do the most for the Yondering Lands/make more of a dent in all this/do the most good> by helping to... <volunteer.hothead/poet/bookish/50:stomp out/snuff out/eliminate/deal with> the problem at its source.
