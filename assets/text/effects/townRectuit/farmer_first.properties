~01~prompt~panel_002~1_volunteer=You’re back? I saw you leave a while ago.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hero=<hero.personality:\n[face:default]I did. But it occurred to me that <ship.exists:we/I> could increase <ship.exists:our/my> effectiveness by a good amount if I got someone else to join <ship.exists:us/me>./\n[face:interested]Well, it’s just… we’re fighting <foes.plural> now. Apparently. And <hero4.exists:four/<hero3.exists:three/<ship.exists:two/one>>> seemed like an awfully small number to do that with./\n[face:happy]Well, all that slaying <foes.plural> works up an appetite, and <town> still has the best hotcake stack around, so I popped back./\n[face:skeptical]I did. And it’s going well. The monster slaying. There’s [i]so[] much monster slaying going on. Just victory after victory, you know?/\n[face:interested]I did. But it occurs to me that <ship.exists:we’ll/I’ll> need more help if <ship.exists:we’re/I'm> going to have any kind of impact on the <foes.plural>. /\n[face:skeptical]I did. And it’s going well. The monster-slaying. There’s [i]so[] much monster-slaying going on. /\n[face:grim]I did. But it occurs to me that <ship.exists:we’ll/I’ll> need more help if <ship.exists:we’re/I'm> going to have any kind of impact on the <foes.plural>./\n[face:skeptical]And I usually like to travel light./\n[face:interested]Indeed. But the omens have been thick between the trees lately./\n[face:interested]I did. But the Yondering Lands are vast. The enemy is tangled in tight./\n[face:skeptical]Sure, but…here's the thing. I figured the more people we have fighting <foes.plural>, the less likely [i]I personally[] am to die.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hero=<hero.personality:\n[face:skeptical]And <town> seemed like the safest bet, so.../\n[face:skeptical]<hero4.exists:Five/<hero3.exists:Four/<ship.exists:Three/Two>>> seems at least a little better./\n[face:interested]Also, <ship.exists:weee’re/I'mmm> gonna need more help./\n[face:dubious]But… eh, bottom line is, <ship.exists:we/I> could do with another pair of hands./\n[face:skeptical]And <town> is right here, so.../\n[face:dubious]But… eh, bottom line is, <ship.exists:we/I> could do with another pair of hands./\n[face:skeptical]And <town> is right here, so.../\n[face:skeptical]But it’s becoming apparent that <ship.exists:we'll/I'll> need another person at some point./\nIt seemed wise to return to <town> and seek additional hands./\n[face:interested]And another soul to stand against the darkness would make this feel more heroic and less… crazy./\n[face:dubious]So getting someone else on board seemed smart.>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hero=Are you interested?
~01~prompt~panel_007.(volunteer_is_Bookish)~1_volunteer=There was a book on <foes.plural> in the archives that I loved.
~01~prompt~panel_008.(volunteer_is_Bookish)~1_volunteer=So I probably know more about them than anyone else in <town>.
~01~prompt~panel_009.(volunteer_is_Bookish)~1_hero=How did I not know that?
~01~prompt~panel_009.(volunteer_is_Bookish)~2_volunteer=It doesn’t come up much.
~01~prompt~panel_010.(volunteer_is_Bookish)~1_volunteer=Until… well.
~01~prompt~panel_011.(volunteer_is_Bookish)~1_volunteer=Anyway, at the very least, I could be useful in that capacity.
~01~prompt~panel_012.(volunteer_is_Coward)~1_volunteer=Me?
~01~prompt~panel_013.(volunteer_is_Coward)~1_hero=...Yes?
~01~prompt~panel_014.(volunteer_is_Coward)~1_volunteer=I’m just surprised.
~01~prompt~panel_015.(volunteer_is_Coward)~1_volunteer=When <ship.exists:you all/you> marched off, I wasn’t surprised. You’re braver than me.
~01~prompt~panel_016.(volunteer_is_Coward)~1_volunteer=I figured I wouldn’t be anybody’s first choice to bring along on a journey like that.
~01~prompt~panel_017.(volunteer_is_Coward)~1_hero=Really? You’d be far better to have along than old <npc> or some such.
~01~prompt~panel_017.(volunteer_is_Coward)~2_hero=If you don’t want to, though—
~01~prompt~panel_018.(volunteer_is_Coward)~1_volunteer=No! I do!
~01~prompt~panel_020.(volunteer_is_Coward)~1_volunteer=Wow, I didn’t even need to work up the nerve to say that.
~01~prompt~panel_022.(volunteer_is_Goofball)~1_volunteer=You know who you’re asking, right?
~01~prompt~panel_022.(volunteer_is_Goofball)~2_hero=Oh, right.
~01~prompt~panel_023.(volunteer_is_Goofball)~1_hero=<hero.goofball.80:[face:joke]/>In that case, some ground rules:
~01~prompt~panel_023.(volunteer_is_Goofball)~2_hero=No frogs in anyone’s bedrolls.
~01~prompt~panel_023.(volunteer_is_Goofball)~3_hero=No shouting “<foes.plural>!” for fun while one of us is <hero.poet/romantic/80:answering nature’s call./answering nature’s call./at the latrine.>
~01~prompt~panel_024.(volunteer_is_Goofball)~1_hero=And you get [i]one[] breakfast per day from the food stores. You want the second one, you scrounge it up yourself.
~01~prompt~panel_025.(volunteer_is_Goofball)~1_volunteer=You drive a rough bargain, <hero>.
~01~prompt~panel_025.(volunteer_is_Goofball)~2_hero=These are rough times.
~01~prompt~panel_027.(volunteer_is_Goofball)~1_volunteer=Hahaha! And <hero.mf:he nails,she nails, they nail> it shut!
~01~prompt~panel_028.(volunteer_is_Greedy)~1_volunteer=Hmm. Perhaps.
~01~prompt~panel_029.(volunteer_is_Greedy)~1_volunteer=Let’s get one thing straight, though. I’m not some second-string sod here, right?
~01~prompt~panel_029.(volunteer_is_Greedy)~2_hero=Of course not.
~01~prompt~panel_030.(volunteer_is_Greedy)~1_volunteer=I get my fair share of the spoils?
~01~prompt~panel_030.(volunteer_is_Greedy)~2_hero=Sure.
~01~prompt~panel_031.(volunteer_is_Greedy)~1_volunteer=My name in the songs?
~01~prompt~panel_031.(volunteer_is_Greedy)~2_hero=If you earn it.
~01~prompt~panel_032.(volunteer_is_Greedy)~1_volunteer=Oh, I will.
~01~prompt~panel_033.(volunteer_is_Healer)~1_volunteer=I'm glad to hear you say that.
~01~prompt~panel_034.(volunteer_is_Healer)~1_volunteer=I was helping <npc> repair the last of the carts, and it struck me that there’s no reason those things might not come back tomorrow.
~01~prompt~panel_035.(volunteer_is_Healer)~1_hero=No reason other than us.
~01~prompt~panel_035.(volunteer_is_Healer)~2_volunteer=Exactly. I don’t want anyone else to have to worry at night.
~01~prompt~panel_036.(volunteer_is_Hothead)~1_volunteer=Well shoot, if you didn't ask, I was just about to go off and break some <foes.singular>-bones of my own!
~01~prompt~panel_037.(volunteer_is_Hothead)~1_hero=Good thing I caught you, then.
~01~prompt~panel_038.(volunteer_is_Hothead)~1_volunteer=Right? Would’ve been awkward to be out-heroed by the <volunteer.mf:guy,gal,person> you left behind.
~01~prompt~panel_039.(volunteer_is_Leader)~1_volunteer=Interested?
~01~prompt~panel_040.(volunteer_is_Leader)~1_volunteer=I’m only sorry I didn’t insist to come along sooner.
~01~prompt~panel_041.(volunteer_is_Leader)~1_hero=Well, you figure [i]somebody[] needs to be helping patch the walls and whatnot.
~01~prompt~panel_042.(volunteer_is_Leader)~1_volunteer=Of course people need to stay and keep <town> running.
~01~prompt~panel_042.(volunteer_is_Leader)~2_volunteer=But I know in my gut that’s not my path.
~01~prompt~panel_043.(volunteer_is_Loner)~1_volunteer=I dunno...
~01~prompt~panel_044.(volunteer_is_Loner)~1_hero=It’s either that or mope around here and probably get roped into repairing old <npc>’s goat pen or something.
~01~prompt~panel_045.(volunteer_is_Loner)~1_hero=And <npc> yammers on more than the rest of the town combined.
~01~prompt~panel_046.(volunteer_is_Loner)~1_hero=Something to consider.
~01~prompt~panel_047.(volunteer_is_Loner)~1_npc=And then she paused and gave me this look and said "[i]Oh, goat's milk is fiiiine.[]" And if you want to lie to someone's face about goats, you better pick someone else because...
~01~prompt~panel_048.(volunteer_is_Loner)~1_npc=...anyway, his son is a strange one, I know 'cause I've seen the things he gets up to behind the granary. People don't raise kids like they used to back
~01~prompt~panel_048.(volunteer_is_Loner)~2_npc=[white]...some folks get peeved, but I tell 'em goats just do that when they like you, so there's nothing to get all bent out of shape
~01~prompt~panel_048.(volunteer_is_Loner)~3_npc=[lightYellow]      So are you free tomorrow? This post \n  is still wobbling and
~01~prompt~panel_050.(volunteer_is_Loner)~1_hero=You're considering it.
~01~prompt~panel_050.(volunteer_is_Loner)~2_volunteer=I am.
~01~prompt~panel_052.(volunteer_is_Poet)~1_volunteer=Me? A lanky branch of a <volunteer.mf:lad,lady,youth>, in battle?
~01~prompt~panel_053.(volunteer_is_Poet)~1_volunteer=...But these [i]are[] ever-shifting days.
~01~prompt~panel_054.(volunteer_is_Poet)~1_volunteer=Perhaps this branch could see itself a spear.
~01~prompt~panel_055.(volunteer_is_Poet)~1_hero=<hero.poet/80:[face:happy]Exactly, you understand./[face:interested]That… sounded promising.>
~01~prompt~panel_057.(volunteer_is_Romantic)~1_volunteer=I have to confess, I was crestfallen when <ship.exists:you all/you> marched off.
~01~prompt~panel_058.(volunteer_is_Romantic)~1_volunteer=The start of a once-in-a-lifetime tale had dropped itself in front of me, and then slipped away just as quickly.
~01~prompt~panel_059.(volunteer_is_Romantic)~1_hero=Oh, um. I didn’t realize. You could have said something.
~01~prompt~panel_060.(volunteer_is_Romantic)~1_volunteer=But now the opportunity returns—a call to answer!
~01~prompt~panel_061.(volunteer_is_Snark)~1_party=You could be the next member of <company>.
~01~prompt~panel_061.(volunteer_is_Snark)~2_volunteer=Wait. You have a [i]company name?[]
~01~prompt~panel_062.(volunteer_is_Snark)~1_hero=Yes.
~01~prompt~panel_062.(volunteer_is_Snark)~2_hero=<hero.snark/80:[face:dubious]/[face:defualt]>I like it.
~01~prompt~panel_062.(volunteer_is_Snark)~3_volunteer=And it's <company>?
~01~prompt~panel_063.(volunteer_is_Snark)~1_volunteer=Are there company badges too?
~01~prompt~panel_064.(volunteer_is_Snark)~1_hero=No. That would be <hero.bookish/leader/goofball/poet/80:impractical/impractical/silly/a bit much/weird>.
~01~prompt~panel_064.(volunteer_is_Snark)~2_volunteer=Of course.
~01~prompt~panel_065~1_hero=So you're in?
~01~prompt~panel_065~2_volunteer=<volunteer.goofball/snark/loner/romantic/80:[face:happy]You betcha./[face:skeptical]I guess I am./[face:dubious]Siiigghhh. Alright./[face:happy]Wholeheartedly./I am.>
~01~prompt~panel_065~3_volunteer=What sorts of skills do you need the most?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_narration=Train <volunteer> as a Warrior
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_narration=Train <volunteer> as a Hunter
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_narration=Train <volunteer> as a Mystic
