~01~~panel_001~3_narration=Of the unremembered recluse who raised this tower, only assorted articles remain, mostly dismantled.
~01~~panel_001~4_hero3=<hero3.exists:[small]<hero3.bookish/goofball/healer/leader/poet/60:Cursory glance tells me the hermit was mystically gifted./[face:happy]Wonder if a ghost and a gorgon would get along?/[face:talking]Stones're slippery. Try and be careful./Could step in [i]anything,[] down here. Watch it./Particles of a person's existence, torn from time or context./[i]Some[] are still mantled...>/>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Odorous mess slicks the floor, gleaming in the noiselessness, \nin the soft glow of fluids that fill the Gorgonglass.
~01~~panel_003~3_hero=[small]<hero.bookish/coward/goofball/snark/60:Everything needs sorting. But sorting needs days of work.../[face:interested]Hope the air's not... as poisonous as it seems./Always decorating in blue.[face:interested]/[face:neutral]Always decorating in blue./Heady [i]smell.[]>
~01~~panel_004~3_hero2=<hero2.exists:<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]Yeah. Let's be fast, so we can get <deadHero.2.exists:them/<deadHero.mf:him/her/them>> out of here./<hero.rfln.hero2:<hero2.goofball.60:[face:talking]Huh? Imagine leaving [i]you[] alone. You won't /Naw. Don't trust you to ><hero.bookish/healer/greedy/poet/60:finish picking around in any sort of timely fashion./handle anything dangerous./keep your hands off the shiny stuff./be quick about it./understand what you're looking at.>/[face:skeptical]<hero2.personality:Isolation? Coupled with proximity to resources? Likely the same advantages that figured into its founding./It's pretty out of the way. Couldn't that be basically it?/Privacy. A place they could play their Gorgon games without interruption.[face:talking]/Well... you think maybe there's some kind of valuable resource here? Or a kind of special whatever? Buried under the foundations?/Could throw out some guesses. But can't draw conclusions until we've looked around, maybe?/Liked the stink of it, I guess./It worked as a staging area. Wasn't defended. Those're my pretty ordinary guesses./I doubt it was the place itself.[face:grim] But what do I know?/Remarkable...? Remarkable thing might just be that [i]they chose it,[] if you get what I mean. But I'm dodging the question, maybe.[face:neutral]/[face:interested]Think there's some kind of special significance to it? I like that idea. Maybe a place in their lore. A place we've lost the meaning of.../Bunch of old junk in a rock house. Inconvenient to get to. Yeah, I don't know. Gorgons like the same stuff spiders do.>/<hero2.healer/poet/romantic/snark/60:It's hard to stomach. Let me know if you need some air, 'kay?/[face:neutral]Bathe. Watch the otters. Yeah. Let's finish this quick./[face:happy]The river. Yeah. I'll wash you, how about that?/[face:neutral]You don't want to kiss me here?/[face:neutral]Wash this crud off us? Yep. It's a deal.>/Hm.[face:interested] There isn't always a definite reason.>>/>
~01~~panel_004~4_hero=<hero2.exists:<deadHero.exists:I wish it was a better place. To die./<hero.rfln.hero2:You should go check the other rooms./[face:skeptical]What's remarkable about this place, you think? \nWhat made them gather here?/[face:talking]Let's go to the river, after this./[face:skeptical]Any idea why [i]this[] is where they gathered?>>/<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]Wish you'd had a better... a better place to die... <deadHero.2.exists:my friends./<deadHero>.>/Coming alone is better.

No one to die./don't go... quick. But... It is a skin-prickling atmosphere, isn't it?/don't quite... understand... what I'm looking at.>>>
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=Over generations now, a long and many-sided plot has been shaped and polished. Flawed in several facets and foiled, its unseen successes now bring it near completion.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=None of this is clear to <hero4.exists:<hero> and the others/<hero3.exists:<hero>, or <hero2>, or <hero3>/<hero2.exists:<hero> or <hero2>/<hero>>>>. But a clue glints, nestled in a bed of birdbones. Throwing light off its surfaces and angles.
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=Epicryst. A storytelling stone.
~01~~panel_006~2_narration=Aside from a few carvings among scattered ruins, these are the sole artifacts of Gorgon language.
~01~~panel_007.(hero2_exists)~1_narration=The images on its faces are mostly inscrutable. However...
~01~~panel_007.(hero2_exists)~3_hero=The silent pit.
~01~~panel_008.(hero2_is_missing)~1_narration=Largely inscrutable, <hero.mf:his/her/their> memory sparks on a peculiar shape.
~01~~panel_008.(hero2_is_missing)~3_hero=The silent pit.
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=A sacred building decorates one of its sides.
~01~~panel_009~3_hero=<hero3.exists:Here, take a look. Or let's get in the clean air. \n<hero.bookish/coward/poet/60:[face:talking]Details demand light. I'd like to be certain./[face:interested]I might know where to go.../This stone is the puzzlepiece we needed./I'll tell you what my hunch is.>/<hero2.exists:Here, I can barely breathe. <hero.bookish/coward/poet/60:[face:talking]Details demand light. I'd like to be certain./[face:interested]I might know where to go. But first is just getting outside again.../This stone is the puzzlepiece we needed. Let's see it in the light./I'll tell you about my hunch, but let's go outside.>/Yes, I remember you. Your outline. Your weird geometry.<hero.bookish/coward/60:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/>>>
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=A buried chapel was delved out and studied a hundred years ago. \nThe murkish syllables of its name forgotten.
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=Sketches are all <hero.mf:he's/she's/they've> seen, but <hero> is confident there's no mistake.
~01~~panel_011~2_narration=After a few days <deadHero.exists:<deadHero.2.exists:of honored burials, and rest,/honoring <deadHero>, and after some rest,>/of rest,> it becomes <hero2.exists:their/<hero.mf:his/her/their>> next destination. And perhaps <hero2.exists:their/<hero.mf:his/her/their>> last.
~01~~panel_011~3_hero=<hero2.exists:Temple of Silence. The Silent Pit. These are the words our legend makers used. It fits too well. Now I feel like we should've guessed before.../Temple of Silence. The Silent Pit. I should've guessed before...>
