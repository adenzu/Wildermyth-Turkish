~01~~panel_001~1_narration=<town> has been a brimming town since the <season-1>, \nwhen solitary folks and families began migrating there.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=Now it's burst its seams. There's not enough homes to cover every head.
~01~~panel_002~1_hero=You two're also from out in the Stitches? Your water dried up?
~01~~panel_002~3_npc=That's right. The <npc2.mf:husband/wife/spouse> and me. Had to save our cow, had to come somewhere.
~01~~panel_002~4_npc2=You folks need a ranch-hand? \nA house-hand?[small]Just need a hand?[]
~01~~panel_002~5_action=[tan][actionSmall]mrm.
~01~~panel_003~1_hero=Unless you're a sword-hand, you're not in our line of work. But we're headed out there, now. If something unnatural's choking up your water supply, we'll get it figured out.
~01~~panel_004~6_hero2=<hero2.personality:[face:talking]The town's overtaxed with people. It's not sustainable, just seeing the food stores, the size of the fields. You're both young, the reasonable thing would be for you to move on. Can't tell you what to do, of course. But.../[face:interested]Not that I'm the expert, but I'd be wary of just squatting out here. Pretty open to predators. Even just for your cow's sake? I don't know. Maybe.../Word to the wise. Lot of people [i]milling[] and [i]mixing.[] I'd watch that <npc2.mf:husband/wife/spouse> of yours. And just...[face:joke]/[face:skeptical]It's risky, everyone gathered here without a wall. I'd sell that big shaggy beast. Coin travels alright. I don't know, I just mean.../[face:talking]Just walking through, I noticed your neighbor's tent was a little near the fire. Crowding can be awful dangerous./[face:grim]And while we're risking our skins out there, we won't be here to save yours. It's a dangerous world, you know?/[face:talking]I'll also just say, this spot your camp's set up? <season+2>, rain's going to come, this whole area gets flooded./This's a vulnerable spot. All these people gathered. You all put the town and each other at risk./[face:talking]Rabbits're fast when they scatter. But when they bolt for the same hole, it slows them down. The ones in back are foxfood./[face:happy]It's not all bad, you know? If I was staying here... Lot of people [i]milling[] and [i]mixing.[] Kind of an opportunity. Talk to that <npc2.mf:husband/wife/spouse> of yours./[face:neutral]Just, uh... maybe a word to the wise. If we're gone, that leaves this place kind of open to attack. If you don't want to be beef and onions for some six-leg monster—sorry, Mister Cow, bad metaphor—I'd just...> Try and have a plan.
~01~~panel_004~7_hero=<hero2.personality:[small][face:neutral]Leave them alone, <hero.pcfn.hero2:<hero2>/<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<hero2>/<hero2>>./[face:neutral][small]Nice, <hero.pcfn.hero2:<hero2>/<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<hero2>/<hero2>>. I'm sure they're not scared already./[small][face:grim]<hero.pcfn.hero2:<hero2>/<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<hero2>/<hero2>>.../[small][face:dubious]<hero.pcfn.hero2:<hero2>/<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<hero2>/<hero2>>.../[face:interested]/[small][face:grim]<hero.pcfn.hero2:<hero2>/<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<hero2>/<hero2>>.../[small][face:neutral]Good point./[small][face:grim]<hero.pcfn.hero2:<hero2>/<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<hero2>/<hero2>>.../[face:skeptical]/[small][face:dubious]<hero.pcfn.hero2:<hero2>/<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/<hero2>/<hero2>>, stop being weird./[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_005~6_npc=What's that even mean? <hero2.personality:Do I ever not have a [i]plan?[]/Do I ever not have a [i]plan?[]/A [i]plan[]?/Do I ever not have a [i]plan?[]/Do I ever not have a [i]plan?[]/Do I ever not have a [i]plan?[]/Do I ever not have a [i]plan?[]/Do I ever not have a [i]plan?[]/Do I ever not have a [i]plan?[]/A [i]plan[]?/A [i]plan[]?>
~01~~panel_005~7_npc2=[small]Yes, dear, yes.
~01~~panel_006~5_action=[actionSmall][tan]mff!
~01~~panel_006~6_npc=No.
~01~~panel_006~7_npc2=But what do [i]you[] think? I bet I could swing a swor—[face:joke]
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=[b]The Stitches[]: it's what folks call that region where rivers and creeks wind among the hills, making deep marshy gullies. Seen from the mountaintop, these resemble the needlework of a huge seamster.
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=All those waterways have dried up, one by one, driving even the long-abiders from their homes.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=The company unites to investigate.
~01~~panel_008~2_hero3=[small]So... pretty good guess [i]who's[] causing it all.
~01~~panel_008~3_hero=[small]Important mainly just to figure out [i]how.[] And then reverse it.
~01~~panel_008~4_hero4=<hero4.exists:[small]With Thrixl... I'm always interested in [i]why.[]/>
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=Human interest is of course unwelcome.
