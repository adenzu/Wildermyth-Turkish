~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.personality:[face:grim]<hero> recognizes the inevitable. In this moment, <hero.mf:he feels/she feels/they feel> an almost detached interest. What's after this? <hero.mf:He/She/They>'ll soon know./[face:grim]Nothing to be done. <hero> feels oddly calm. There's nothing more to fear./[face:sad]<hero> had a lot more to say. More folks to annoy and delight, and probably somewhere, a better place to lie down and let the end roll over <hero.mf:him/her/them>. Maybe that's why it happens./[face:angry]It's not <hero>'s time. It can't be, can it? There's still so much <hero.mf:he needs/she needs/they need> to do. To enjoy. Things <hero.mf:he/she/they> wanted to at least put in order./[face:interested]All <hero.mf:he/she/they> can think of, here at the end... is how the others will feel. <hero.mf:He hopes/She hopes/<hero> hopes> they won't blame themselves./[face:rage]<hero> roars. If this is it, <hero.mf:he/she/they>'ll make sure no one forgets!/[face:rage]With a defiant yell, <hero> sees the end. <hero.mf:He/She/They>'ll meet it bravely./[face:grim]This [i]is[] it. <hero> knows it, and, for a moment, is thankful. After everything, <hero.mf:he/she/they> won't die alone./Mortality stares <hero> in the face, and [face:default]<hero.mf:he/she/they> can't feel any anger. Something in <hero.mf:him/her/them> knows that, whatever's next, it'll surprise <hero.mf:him/her/them>. Indeed it does./[face:angry]<hero> always hoped to die like a hero. In this moment, <hero.mf:he realizes/she realizes/they realize> that's a useless wish. There's love to be shared, song and laughter to join. If only <hero.mf:he/she/they> had more time./<hero> never gave death too much credit.[face:grim] Not a subtle or clever thing, death. Just an inevitability, like life, like pain, like the little causes and smiles you hope will make it worthwhile.>
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=The killing blow comes...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=...but it doesn't fully connect!
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_action=[white]TH-TCH!
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_hero=Unk.
~02~choice_flee~panel_001~1_narration=Something seems to have saved <hero.mf:him/her/them>...
~03~player_chose_flee~panel_001~1_hero=It's funny how things go.

~03~player_chose_flee~panel_002~2_thought=That a walk in the woods, an accident, a random decision...
~03~player_chose_flee~panel_003~1_thought=...would be the sliver by which I survive.
~03~player_chose_flee~panel_004~1_narration=That splinter of elmwood, that <hero.mf:he/she/they>'d hung by <hero.mf:his/her/their> belt and had largely forgotten about...
~03~player_chose_flee~panel_005~1_narration=...had burst from its pouch, rapidly growing into a shield, girdling <hero.mf:him/her/them> and deflecting the blow.
~03~player_chose_flee~panel_006~1_hero=<hero.personality:[face:skeptical]Well this's not at all what I expected. But let's not let that confound us, huh?/[face:scared]Thank... Oh! I need to move! Agh!/[face:interested]That's trees, I guess. \nWhat can you do?/[face:happy]And [i]that's[] why I hold onto things. You never do know.../[face:interested]Very good. Alright. Now let's [i]all[] live this out./[face:scheming]Call me the Elmblooded! \nI'll never die!/[face:grim]Alright. Then it's time \nto turn the tide./[face:skeptical]Suppose I'll have to place more trust in things./[face:talking]The wild has a will of its own. Seems it won't let me go so easily./[face:happy]Guess I'm still wanted. Any gods that listen, bless the elms of the world!/[face:dubious]Looks like I'll have to keep going.>
