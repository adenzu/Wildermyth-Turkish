Breath tamps down emotions to be dealt with later./<maimedHero.exists:After patching up the injured, <hero> turns to the <npc.mf:man/woman/figure> who is now rubbing <npc.mf:his/her/their> arms and staring at the ground./The clouds begin to disperse, and <hero> regards the <npc.mf:man/woman/figure> who is now rubbing <npc.mf:his/her/their> arms and staring at the ground.>>
~01~~panel_002~1_hero=<npc>?
~01~~panel_003~1_npc=...Do I know you?
~01~~panel_004~1_hero=Your <npc2.mf:husband/wife/partner> sends <npc2.mf:his/her/their> regards.
~01~~panel_006~1_hero=So what’s the story? “Watching the goats?”
~01~~panel_007~1_npc=The goats do like it here.
~01~~panel_007~2_actionSmall=[lightYellow]Maa-aa?
~01~~panel_008~1_npc=They climb the ruins.
~01~~panel_008~2_actionSmall=[tan]Maaa!
~01~~panel_008~3_actionSmall=Braaahhh!
~01~~panel_009~1_npc=But that’s not… when the <overlandTile.biome> began to get more dangerous, I thought it might be time to finally use the Stormwell here.
~01~~panel_009~2_hero=This? What is it?
~01~~panel_010~1_npc=Surprised you haven’t heard of it.
~01~~panel_011~1_npc=This thing’s been on the family land forever. <npc3.mf:Uncle/Aunt/Cousin> said it was Kyoren.
~01~~panel_011~2_npc=We had stories that it could—this is going to sound crazy, but—that it could give you [i]power.[]
~01~~panel_012~1_npc=And my family are abysmal storytellers, see? Terrible imaginations. So I thought, maybe they’re not [i]just[] stories.
~01~~panel_013~1_npc=Maybe I could... you know. Protect the goats.
~01~~panel_013~2_action=Behhh!
~01~~panel_014~1_npc=...And my <npc2.mf:husband/wife/partner>. My <npc2>. If I could get ahold of that power.
~01~~panel_015~1_npc=It takes research, some old family recipes, and time. Lots of time to get a Stormwell to give up its secrets.
~01~~panel_015~2_npc=I didn't want to tell <npc2>...
~01~~panel_016.(friend_exists)~1_friend=Rather <npc2.mf:he/she/they> came up with a story of <npc2.mf:his/her/their> own?
~01~~panel_017.(friend_is_missing)~1_hero=Rather <npc2.mf:he/she/they> came up with a story of <npc2.mf:his/her/their> own?
~01~~panel_018~1_npc=Better than the story of a goatherd trying to wear a hat two sizes too big for <npc.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~~panel_019~1_npc=It's a shame, though. I needed maybe one more good storm.
~01~~panel_020~1_npc=The clouds looked promising today, and I thought I could finish the process before the monsters got here.
~01~~panel_020~2_npc=No such luck.
~01~~panel_021~1_npc=It was silly, now that I’ve seen what fighting really is.
~01~~panel_022~1_npc=I’m not cut out for it.
~01~~panel_022~2_npc=Glad I never told <npc2>.
~01~~panel_023~1_hero=So now you're going to...?
~01~~panel_023~2_npc=Count my goats and go home? Yeah.
~01~~panel_025~1_npc=Unless one of you wants it.
~01~~panel_028.(friend_exists)~1_friend=It's possible.
~01~~panel_028.(friend_exists)~2_hero=<deadHero.exists:Prevent somebody from dying next time./<maimedHero.exists:Prevent someone from getting hurt next time./<hero.bookish/coward/healer/leader/60:It is a fascinating artifact./Wouldn’t want something else nasty to grab it./Your work wouldn’t go to waste./Your work wouldn’t go to waste./Thunderstuff, huh?>>>
~01~~panel_029.(friend_is_missing)~1_hero=It's possible. <hero.hothead/greedy:Make the beasts pay good next time./Make the beasts pay good next time./Make the next fight less dangerous.>
~01~~panel_030~1_npc=The sky’s clearing now, but if you want to take me up on it, come back sometime.
~01~~panel_031~1_npc=Ask for <npc.fullname>. <npc2>, too.
~01~~panel_032~1_npc=We’ll feed you, put you up, give you otherworldly powers... <deadHero.exists:Make up for what happened here today./<maimedHero.exists:Make up for what happened here today./<overlandTile.Biome>-folk hospitality, you know.>>
~01~~panel_032~2_action=Mehhh.
