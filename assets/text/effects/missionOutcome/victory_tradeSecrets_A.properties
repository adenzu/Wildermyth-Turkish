~01~~panel_009~5_narration=The hike back to <npc2>'s home takes the better part of the day.

~01~~panel_011~1_hero=<hero.greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:Huh. But <npc.mf:his/her/their> plum whiskey's pretty famous.

~01~~panel_012~3_npc2=Grandpa <npc.lastName> was who made it famous. <npc>, \nnow, <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> just the one stuck with a reputation.
~01~~panel_013~3_npc2=[i]Shackled[] to it, I should say. Like there's a big ole block of family legacy <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> lugging around. Can't lift an eyebrow without consulting <npc.mf:his/her/their> notes. Wouldn't [i]dream[] of tweaking the recipe when an ingredient runs short.
~01~~panel_014~3_npc2=<npc.mf:He's/She's/They're> the worst kind of perfectionist. A [i]slow[] one. And after all <npc.mf:his/her/their> work, \nif a batch doesn't taste [i]exactly[] like grandpa's, <npc.mf:he throws/she throws/they throw> it out!
