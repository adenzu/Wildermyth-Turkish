~01~~panel_003~2_mystic=[i]Daylig Dayn[]. She kept chanting, [i]Daylig Dayn[]. \n<mystic.heartofstone_Choice1/heartofStone_choice2/heartofStone_choice3:[face:grim]Now I know what to call you./It's not the first time we've met./Was that your name? You never said it to [i]me.[][face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_004~1_mystic=<random:Those myths go round. Of the Stoneshearing God./And Dungeondeep. A fairytale place./Shows up in Old Kyoren Smokestory./Thnarric rhymes memorialize him.> <mystic.themePiece_gem_head/heartofStone_choice3:But I never would've put the face to the yarn. Or thought... that those little stone children were somehow.../There're many [i]facets[] to these deities, I suppose. And a lot about the Deepists, and their magic... that we don't quite understand./<mystic.bookish/goofball/greedy/loner/poet/romantic/snark/80:Suppose I was always skeptical. You know how it is, with old gods and rumors. You don't expect to see them... so [i]lucidly[]. To catch them mid-miracle./[face:happy]It's almost comical, or sad, or I don't know. Those cult-masters. Blowing horns. Begging orphans from a defunct deity of dead civilizations.../It's odd, but... There's a use for these old gods, long after their churches lie forgotten./I love the stories, and I hate them. Lean on them, but I hate.../Traditions die slow deaths. Maybe they never cease being. Persisting./I hear, Daylig Dayn, that you once shaped every mountain, a bouquet for the weightless moon. And wept to realize she was blind./[face:dubious]Kind of pathetic, actually. If those little stonelings are the best the old fellow can offer./Not that I'm the lore-chief around here. Some legends, you just hang on to. For no real reason.>>
~01~~panel_005~1_mystic=<mystic.themePiece_gem_head/heartofStone_choice3:All those rocks, crystals, gems. All are kind of... the same stuff. Aren't they? The great whole earth. Made singular only by the hand of weather, time, jeweler, or god. That cuts them./If you turn over a great stone, you'll usually discover... just a trove of bugs. Spiders. Beetles. And worms. It's all the same to the stone. It's all just writhing life.[face:grim]/<mystic.bookish/goofball/greedy/loner/poet/romantic/snark/80:Makes you want to record it. To tell people, to pass the story on. And makes you wonder. About every tall-tale you've heard, and how easily you've dismissed them.../What do they want them for, anyway? They're not great soldiers, those little stone children. But I guess, when you've got magic to do, you do it. I wonder what mark it leaves.../They still inspire faith of a kind. The hopeless often look behind them. For simplicity. For the easy world of made-up memories. Nostalgia for nothing that ever was./Hate that feeling of wanting to believe what I know is... stupid. Unworthy of my reaching eyes, my pawing soul. Wasted needing of those warm netherflung lies./The truth, too often, is invisible. Impossible to see. The way you can't see a mountain, so large and near is its base-most rock./You should've known, from her big milky eye. Kind and sightless, sleeping and staring. And now you live beyond her shine. I understand that kind of self-torment./Wonder what you really think of them? O, Daylig Dayn, if really you exist behind that hard face... I get the sense... it's the smirk of a rich man passing trash to crowing beggars./But the reason lives inside you somewhere. You can [i]tell[] that it does. Some piece of you that you're too humiliated to acknowledge... needs a story's nightly company. To sleep.>>
