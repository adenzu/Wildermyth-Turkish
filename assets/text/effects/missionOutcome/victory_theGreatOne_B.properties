~01~~panel_007~2_npc4=Now that they're gone... I think all of us are going to pick up and leave these cursed stones behind.

~01~~panel_008~2_npc4=You're welcome to take what we can't carry. Use it well. And remember that you'll always have our gratitude. Though I'm sure you won't recall our names and faces, we'll cherish yours.
~01~~panel_009~3_narration=It turns out to be a cold morning. Clouds churning up from the East devour the sun. <loner><leader.exists:<coward.exists: and the others/ and <leader>> head out/<maimedHero.exists: and the wounded head out/heads out>> after salvaging some of the things that the villagers leave behind. The lair of the Great One will be overgrown with weeds, and the atrocities committed there will one day pass from memory. The bones of these abandoned buildings will long stand as a testament to the danger of fear, the poisonous desperation it breeds.
