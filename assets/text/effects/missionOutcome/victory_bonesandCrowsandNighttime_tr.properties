Maybe I'll try and gamble her for her jewel. A mother owl, I mean./[face:grim]Forests are afraid of their owls. Like any village would fear a roosting killer./[face:talking]I always took that to mean... owls are lonely. Lovelorn. Exiled, maybe, from a cosmic country./Owls vomit bone-wads. So. Remember who you're talking to. And about.[face:neutral]/It's nice to imagine a thing like that. Whatever it ends up meaning.>/<hero.goofball/hothead/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:happy]How many stars can you fit in an empty bottle? \nHave you ever played that game?/[face:grim]If you've got a problem, say so./Someone cares, I'm sure, when you talk your belittling way. All I hear is a worried <hero2.mf:man/woman/mind>./[face:happy]I'm glad you'll have the memory. Of me this way. Before whatever's next to happen... happens./[face:skeptical]Ah, am I doing it? Good.
