~01~~panel_001~2_hero=<hero2.exists:Here it is. The chest <npc.mf:he was/she was/they were> so worried about./>
~01~~panel_002~1_hero=<deadHero.exists:<hero.bookish/coward/snark/60:I imagine it must be important, whatever\n<npc.mf:he keeps/she keeps/they keep> in here. Hope it was worth it./Said it was important. But, I mean...\nwas it [i]really[] worth...?/Doesn't look like much. Sure\nhope it was all worth it./Whatever's inside, just hope it was worth it.>/<hero.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested]I'll admit I'm curious.

Why it's important?/[face:talking]So, what do you think it's full of? Smelly socks?\nOld hairwads?

~01~~panel_003~1_npc=[action]Helloooo? Is it over?
~01~~panel_004~1_npc=It went quiet, so I... Oh! You found it? Is everything...?
~01~~panel_005~1_npc=Six... seven... eight. All of Grandpa's journals are here. His recipes. And his diagrams.
~01~~panel_006~1_hero2=<hero2.exists:<hero2.goofball/greedy/hothead/romantic/60:[face:interested]Diagrams? [i]Yuck.[]/[face:dubious]Calls [i]that[] a treasure?/[face:dubious]Bunch of papers. Fun stuff./[face:skeptical]So [i]not[] love letters.../So that's it, right? Job's done?>/>
~01~~panel_006~2_hero=<hero2.exists:/[face:grim]If that's all, then, I'll just... get going.>
~01~~panel_007~3_npc=Oh, but don't be sneaking off just yet. If [i]this[] survived, maybe there'll be a bottle or two in the cellar.
~01~~panel_008~1_hero=<hero.coward/goofball/hothead/snark/60:Uh, hey. Think there's something... in that barrel?/It's... wiggling. What do you [i]put[] in these barrels?/Hang on. Something's moving. Might be a.../[face:skeptical]What [i]exactly[] do you keep in these things?/It's somebody... or something?>
~01~~panel_008~2_action=...urrrk... \n   ...upfff...
~01~~panel_008~3_npc=I'll have my hands full putting this place back together. Can't be helped. But Grandpa had less than this when he started. No one ever said the <npc.lastName> family lacked tenacity.
~01~~panel_009~3_npc=<npc2.fullName>. Guess [i]you[] survived.
~01~~panel_010~2_action=...rrruh... \n   ...hemm...
~01~~panel_011~3_npc2=You here, <npc>? Was hoping...

Where'd <npc2.mf:he/she/they> get clothes like that?/Looks a little green around the edges./Good thing we didn't smash [i]all[] the barrels, huh?/Dresses kind of spiffy for a pigherder./Doesn't look so bad. Considering.>/>
~01~~panel_011~5_npc=To have a look around the place while I was gone?\nTo get your clammy fingers on my recipes?
~01~~panel_012~3_npc2=Pff. Told you I've got [i]my own[] ideas. Don't need any dusty old recipes and quaint family traditions propping me up.
~01~~panel_013~3_npc2=But, just out of curiosity, where [i]were[] they?
~01~~panel_013~4_npc=Always were a thickhead.
~01~~panel_014~2_npc=Get going, <npc2>. Not the first time your schemes came to nothing. Won't be the last.

Yeah./<hero2.coward/goofball/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Probably best to stay out of it... right?/[face:happy]Ha. Just a couple of pricklytoads croaking over who owns which side of the puddle./[face:skeptical]Eh. Pretty tame, as squabbles go. Never even came to blows./[face:skeptical]None of [i]our[] business, is it? Awkard we're still here, is all./[face:skeptical]Eh. They're alive, thanks to us. Can't make people [i]like[] each other./[face:interested]It's a way of life for some people. Constant bickering.>>/[face:grim]You take it for granted. Until the day... someone's gone forever.>/>
~01~~panel_015~2_hero=<hero3.exists:/<hero2.exists:[face:grim]<hero.bookish/hothead/poet/snark/60:I envy them a little. How they can go back to old, meaningless squabbles.

~01~~panel_015~3_npc=[small]Give that ugly hoggo a kiss for me!
~01~~panel_015~4_hero3=<hero3.exists:<hero3.rivalOf.hero2:[face:skeptical]That what [i]we[] sound like when we fight?/<hero3.bookish/coward/healer/poet/60:[face:skeptical]Hmm. Did we involve ourselves in some kind of longstanding competition?/[face:interested]They really... like going at it, I guess?/[face:interested]Wonder what started it. Sure have a lot of animosity for neighbors./[face:skeptical]Hmm. Did we involve ourselves in some kind of longstanding competition?/Guess they have a whole history.>>/>
~01~~panel_016~1_npc=Hoo, smells better already, doesn't it?
~01~~panel_017~1_npc=But now's not the time for idling! \nDown these steps...
~01~~panel_018~2_npc=...and here it is! Grandpa's original, sealed all these years! Libation of the gods, \nhe called it. Soothes the spirit. Braces the bones. It'll do you some good.
~01~~panel_019~2_npc=Don't be shy. Won't be the last of House <npc.lastName>'s plum whiskey, thanks to you. Someday, if your road leads you back this way, you'll get a taste of what [i]I[] can brew.
~01~~panel_020.(deadHero_exists)~1_narration=<hero2.exists:They sip/<hero> sips> it slowly, in the dimming light, remembering the one<deadHero.2.exists:s/> <hero2.exists:they/<hero.mf:he/she/they>> lost today. <deadHero.4.exists:<deadHero.4>, <deadHero.3>, <deadHero.2>, and <deadHero>./<deadHero.3.exists:<deadHero.3>, <deadHero.2>, and <deadHero>./<deadHero.2.exists:<deadHero.2> and <deadHero>./<deadHero.fullName>.>>> The fight will go on without <deadHero.2.exists:them/<deadHero.mf:him/her/them>>.
