~01~prompt~panel_002~1_speech=Hello?
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_greedy=I think it's coming from over here!
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_speech=Hello? Is anyone out there?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_goofball=Did we... miss one?
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_speech=I'm a person! I swear! Please let me out! I've been stuck in here for days!
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/romantic/60:One thing versus all of us? I think we'll be okay, right team?/Whatever it is, we can take it. Open 'er up!/Could be a beast, could be love at first sight! Let's open it up and find out!/Can't be worse than what we just fought. Let's open it up!>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_goofball=Here's to hoping I'm not about to doom us all!
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_none=[white]*hack-cough*
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_narration=After some particularly heroic prying, the door groans open, spewing ochre dust.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc=<npc.healer/goofball/hothead:Ahhh! It feels so good to breathe fresh again!/Freedom!/>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_leader=<leader.hothead/leader:Who are you and how did you get stuck in that cabinet?/Now that you're out, maybe you can tell us who you are and how you got stuck in there.>

~01~prompt~panel_011~1_npc=As for how I got in there, well, that's a... rather embarassing story.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_npc=<npc.bookish/hothead/60:I came here in order to study these creatures. I thought they were all inert, but they came to life!/These creatures attacked our village! I came here for revenge, but there were too many./I came here with a group, hoping to root out these abominations, but they were too much for us!>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_npc=<npc.bookish/hothead/60:I got all the wrong sort of information about these monsters. They attacked and I had to hide!/I thought I could handle them on my own, but... they were too strong. I tried to get away, but I could only hide in the end. /My group didn't make it. I was the only one left and I... I hid.>
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_npc=<npc.bookish/hothead/60:Please! Let me join your group! I can continue my studies AND help you!/Let me join you! I'd be an asset to your group, and I still have a score to settle./Please, let me join you! I have even more of a reason to fight now.>
~02~choice_two~panel_001~1_greedy=<greedy.greedy/loner/hothead/60:Another person to split loot with? I don't think so./Our party is already large enough. I say no./Babysit a wannabe who hides in a closet? I don't think so./I don't think it's a good idea. I say no.>

~04~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_npc=<npc.bookish/leader/hothead/60:I shall find another way to pursue my studies, then. Goodbye./So be it./[face:angry]Fine. I don't need some company, anyhow./I see. I shall just have to find my own way then.>
~05~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_npc=Fantastic!
~05~player_chose_three~panel_001~2_npc=...So what happens next?
~05~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_goofball=There's gotta be something in here you can use as a weapon. Let's poke around...
