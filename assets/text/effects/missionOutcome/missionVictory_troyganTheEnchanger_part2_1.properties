~01~prompt~panel_001.(hook_is_coward)~1_hook=You think there's more of those things? Must've been guarding the place, right?
~01~prompt~panel_001.(hook_is_coward)~2_bookish=<bookish.bookish/hothead/greedy/70:/Hope there are. I do love to wreck a bonewretch./Guards are a good thing, <hook>. You don't set eternal watch on a worthless hole./>
~01~prompt~panel_002.(hook_is_goofball)~1_hook=Something about those guys just cracks me up.
~01~prompt~panel_003.(hook_NOT_coward/goofball_(80))~1_hook=Well, that was the guards, right? Kind of gives me hope we [i]found[] something.
~01~prompt~panel_003.(hook_NOT_coward/goofball_(80))~2_bookish=<bookish.poet.80:Has this become trite to us? I worry for the death of our sensibilities.../Standard bonebrass, but sure.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_narration=The great machine at the back of the hall never stops whirring...
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_bookish=Two orbous green crystals on the face of the aparatus begin to glow.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_bookish=And strangest of all...
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_bookish=[green]...I am Troygan the Enchanger...
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_speech=[green]...do they not speak...?
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hook=<hook.bookish/hothead/greedy/snark/60:Troygan, are we to believe you're a conscious being? Or just more Morthagi clock-wattle?/Um, we're trying to decide whether to start hitting you with weapons, Troygan. Any thoughts?/Troygan? Please forgive the question, but what's a Troygan, and how many of you are there?/Well you certainly don't look like a <hook.awm:Stephanie or a Jane/Robert or a Gary>./Um, neat, I'm <hook>. This is<hook.rfln.bookish: your lunch, <bookish>./ my buddy, <bookish>./ <bookish>./ <bookish>.>>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_speech=[green]<hook.bookish/hothead/greedy/snark/60:Morthagi...? Ah. <hook.mf:He/She/They> refers to the Help. No, I am not one of them. Once, I was a Master Maker./Once I was a Master Maker, and I would have shrunk from violence. But I no longer care if I continue. Or if I don't./Troygan Clume is a name that once echoed in marble halls. It meant me. You see, I once was a Master Maker./I'm not one of those. I am Troygan. I once was a Master Maker./...I believe you've already met the Help. I'm sorry they were not welcoming to you. I once controlled them.>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_speech=[green]Now my consciousness lives in these deathless parts and beautiful gears.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_speech=[green]I am still Troygan, yet I am He no longer. I am the keeper of this Morthificery.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/leader/80:It's a feat of science, or art, or magic. Not sure what to call it./This thing is a lord of the Morthagi. It's dangerous./Morthificery? This thing makes Morthagi...>
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_speech=[green]One of you was wounded gravely. <hook.maimal:An arm, a precious arm.../Separated from a leg.../Or have my perceptions gone awry?> I can fix you. In fact, I exist for that purpose...
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_speech=[green]I will fashion a fine instrument. I will compose it with elegant moving machinery that makes you more capable than before...
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_bookish=<hook.rfln.bookish:<bookish.bookish/healer/hothead/greedy/poet/snark:Let it experiment on you. I'm curious./Such a thing shouldn't be medically possible. But you probably don't care, do you?/Even a dolt like you couldn't buy into this! Let's wreck this thing and go home./I know you don't care what I think, but this is honestly a terrible idea./To join a living body with the machinery of death? It's an atrocity! Even you wouldn't stoop so low.../Maybe it could replace your brain next, with one that actually works.>/<bookish.bookish/healer/hothead/greedy/poet/snark:I know you're thinking about it. I'm even curious myself. Just be careful./It doesn't seem possible, with what I know of mending the body.../You can't put yourself in this thing's power! We should be breaking it to pieces!/Just do me a favor and listen to me. This thing does not have your best interest in mind. /There is an elemental wrongness to this, grafting death to life. I know you see it too./Yeah, perfect. Let the skeleton-machine fiddle with your body! What could go wrong? >/<bookish.bookish/healer/hothead/greedy/poet/snark:I know you, <hook>. We're both wondering if this kind of magic is even possible. Just be careful./I know it seems like everything you've wanted. I just don't think it's possible. Be certain./If I were in your shoes, I'd tear this thing to pieces. But... I'm not. It's your decision./I know you don't want to hear this, but I don't want to lose you, and I don't think this is safe./I feel there is much we might have to answer for, if we accept this thing's offer. But I'll stand by you, no matter what./Yeah, sure. Because miracle tonics always work without consequences. >/<bookish.bookish/healer/hothead/greedy/poet/snark:I'll say I'm a bit curious. Just, let's at least be wary./It makes no sense with what we know of healing and recovery.../If I have a vote, I say dismantle the abomination here and now./I know we're not close, but I'd like to say that there is no way this is a good idea./It just feels wrong, doesn't it? Like an affront to nature, a stain on us all.../Oh, this is a great idea. I was just thinking of asking an ancient Gorgonlord to be my chef. >>
~01~prompt~panel_018.(hook_and_bookish_are_friends).(bookish_is_greedy)~1_speech=[green]I don't have any interest at all. I only see a need, and wish to fill it...

~01~prompt~panel_021.(hook_and_bookish_no_relationship).(bookish_is_healer)~1_speech=[green]That only means you have much more to learn...
~01~prompt~panel_022.(hook_and_bookish_no_relationship).(bookish_is_snark)~1_speech=[green]The gorgons do come up with some inventive meats...
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hook=<bookish.bookish/healer/hothead/greedy/poet/snark:I am curious. And I couldn't forgive myself if I threw this chance away on account of fear./And yet, if it is possible...? I have to try./You all can destroy it later, if it ends up grinding me to grist.../I respect your opinion. But I have to try./You're being dramatic. I'm going to do this./Good idea or not, I feel compelled to try.>
~03~choice_three~panel_001~1_hook=<bookish.bookish/healer/hothead/greedy/poet/snark:I am curious. But I can't let that open the door to evil./I accept the price I paid. I'm proud of it. I won't dishonor that by seeking the devil's help./Yes, you're right. No good can come of these monstrosities./Thank you for being honest. I agree with you./Indeed, even the prospect makes my heart recoil. Let's demolish this thing./You're right. I see no reasonable way I can trust this thing.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_speech=[green]You choose with the wisdom of the Old Ones, who were my brethren.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/hothead/snark:That's what should worry us, right there./That's not a compliment, you know./Funny, I was just about to say the same thing.>

~06~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_narration=...and at some unmarked moment the light in those green crystals dies. The thing called Troygan has been forever silenced...
~06~player_chose_three~panel_003.(bookish_and_hook_are_rivals)~1_bookish=I'm surprised you made the sensible choice.
~06~player_chose_three~panel_004.(bookish_and_hook_are_friends)~1_bookish=That wasn't easy for you, was it...?
