~01~prompt~panel_001~1_coward=Hey! Look what I found!
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_target2=<target2.greedy.60:Something shiny?/A clue to the people who built this place?>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_goofball=I got this lid open by myself. I think it's more of the statue!
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_target2=The middle piece, right? The torso?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_target2=If that's the torso, it must have been about twice my height...It probably fit into one of these alcoves.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_target2=<target2.greedy/bookish/60:Let's look in those other chests. The head might have gems for eyes or something.../Let's go look in those other chests. We should learn as much as we can about this place./Let's go look at those other chests. I bet the head's in one of them.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_coward=Doesn't it bother anyone else that the statue was stored in three separate--
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_target2=Found it! Here's the head!
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_goofball=Oh wow, it's, like, head day or something. I found a head too.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_goofball=I mean...a stone head. Not an actual head. That would be gross. Yours is a stone head too, right?
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_narration=Later...
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_coward=Um...are you sure this is a good idea?
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_target2=<target2.leader/greedy/healer/poet/bookish/60: Why not? The site is secure, and we did say our mission was to bring peace and civilization to the Yondering Lands. Art is part of civilization, right? / Why not? There aren't any gems to pry off or gold to melt. We might as well put it back together before we move on. / Of course it is. We should honor those who built this statue by restoring it to its proper appearance. / Of course it is. We should join what has been severed, restore what has been destroyed...it's what we pledged to do for the Yondering Lands. / Fascinating...the stones have been shaped so that either could sit atop the torso.../Why not? We did say our mission was to bring peace and civilization to the Yondering Lands. Art is part of civilization, right?>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_target2=<target2.bookish.60:So the question is, which head do we use?/The only question is, which head do we use?>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_goofball=No question in my mind! There aren't nearly enough frogs in the world.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=50%
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_target2=I'd prefer the ram. It's more dignified.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=50%
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_coward=Seriously, we should leave this thing alone!
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~1_goofball=Here... we... go!
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~2_actionLarge=ka-chink!

~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_006~1_actionLarge=boing!
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_007~1_actionLarge=...thud. Creak...
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_008~1_actionLarge=boing!
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_009~1_target2=thud
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010~1_darken=[green][large]That ... feels ... wonderful.
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_010~2_darken=[large][green] I got ... so ... stiff ...all those years ... in that box.
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_011~1_darken=[green][large]I shall give ... a gift ... to you who ... set me free.
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_012~1_darken=[green][large]Look in the ... last chest ... over there.
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_014~1_coward=[green][large]Now to see ... how the world has changed.
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_001~1_goofball=Here... we... go!

~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_015~1_coward=[green][large]Now to see ... how the world has changed.
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_016~1_goofball=Hey! Wait--
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_017~1_coward=Now I bet you wish you'd listened to me and left it alone!
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_018~1_goofball=Oh, I don't know, <coward>. Like I said before...
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_019~1_goofball=...there aren't nearly enough frogs in the world.
~07~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_001~1_target2=Here... we... go!
~07~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_001~2_actionLarge=ka-chink!
~07~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_005~1_darken=[gold][large]Centuries ... I have waited ... trapped ... in the darkness ....
~07~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_006~1_coward=[gold][large]And you ... have freed me.
~07~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_008~1_coward=[large][gold]One day ... I shall repay ... the debt I owe you.
~07~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_012~1_target2=Well, that was...unexpected.
~07~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_013~1_goofball=Bet you're glad we messed with the thing now, right <coward>?
~07~player_chose_two.test_pass~panel_015~1_coward=Could still turn out badly.
~08~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_001~1_target2=Here... we... go!
~08~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_001~2_actionLarge=ka-chink!
~08~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_005~1_darken=[gold][large]Centuries ... I have waited ... trapped ... in the darkness ....
~08~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_006~1_darken=[b] [large][gold]NOW I SHALL HAVE MY VENGEANCE
~08~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_007~1_target2=Hey, wait—we're not the ones who—
~08~player_chose_two.test_fail~panel_009~1_coward=I told you we should have left it alone!
~09~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_target2=<target2.greedy/bookish/poet/60:Oh, all right. I suppose there's nothing to be gained by putting it together. / Oh, all right. I suppose there's nothing more to be learned here. / Oh, all right. There's something fitting in leaving it broken, too./All right, <coward>, if you feel that strongly about it.>
~09~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_target2=Fine, we'll do the boring thing!
