~01~~panel_003~1_ship=So I have a surprise for you. Come on!
~01~~panel_004~1_ship=<npc>! Good, you're still here!
~01~~panel_004~2_npc=H'llo.
~01~~panel_005~1_ship=<maimedHero>, this is <npc>. <npc.mf:He's/She's/They're> headed back out of here, and I've arranged a slight detour for <npc.mf:him/her/them> to give you a lift back to town.
~01~~panel_006~1_maimedHero=Arranged...?
~01~~panel_007~1_maimedHero=<ship.personality:\nYou mean you bombarded <npc.mf:him,her,them> with some arsenal of reasons?/\nDid you give <npc.mf:him,her,them> the sad face?/\nHow do you manage this sort of thing?/\nHow much did you pay <npc.mf:him,her,them>?/\nDid you have to bribe <npc.mf:him,her,them>, or...?/\nYou didn’t [i]threaten[] <npc.mf:him,her,them>, did you? /\nDon’t tell me you intimidated—/\nYou actually [i]approached[] someone?

A distraught <ship.age.35:old/young> hero and <ship.mf:his,her,their> injured companion? Who wouldn't be moved?/\n[face:joke]Turns out having just saved <site> makes people get all grateful.>
~01~~panel_008~1_maimedHero=...Hrm.

~01~~panel_009~1_maimedHero=<maimedHero.loner/80:...Wait, does that mean I'm going to have to make small talk with <npc.mf:him,her,them> the whole way there?/...It just feels weird. Getting special treatment.>
