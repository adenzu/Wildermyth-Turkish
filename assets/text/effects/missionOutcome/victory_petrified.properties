~01~~panel_001~1_goofball=Hello ... What's that?
~01~~panel_002~1_greedy=What's what! What's what?? What did you find?
~01~~panel_003~1_goofball=Ah, I'm not sure ...
~01~~panel_005~1_goofball=They look like ...
~01~~panel_005~2_greedy=... eggs.
~01~~panel_006~1_goofball=They sort of ... sparkle.
~01~~panel_006~2_greedy=They look old and most of them are broken. Not going to fetch us any coin.
~01~~panel_007~1_bookish=These aren't just any eggs! <bookish.bookish/snark/60:They're [i]dragon []eggs! I've read about clutches like this in Bastalion's Bestiary!/My friends, we've stumbled upon a clutch belonging to the long lost sky lizards - [i]dragons[]!/They're [i]dragon []eggs!>
~01~~panel_008~1_goofball=Dragons? Could the ones who hatched still be here? ... What about their parents!
~01~~panel_009~1_bookish=I don't think so. Look at the dust on them. They've been here for a very long time.
~01~~panel_010~1_greedy=[b][i]Dragon[] []eggs? I take it back! That actually does sound like something we can sell!
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=<greedy> approaches the pile, but try as <greedy.mf:he/she/they> might, neither the unbroken eggs nor the shards can be pried loose.
~01~~panel_012~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/hothead/poet/60:The whole clutch has become petrified! It must have something to do with the run off from that mountain./It's no use! They've turned to stone after who knows how many years./What once was the promise of life, is now but a pile of petrified stone./The whole nest has turned to stone! They must have been here for ages.>
~01~~panel_013~1_bookish=Do you feel that? Sort of like a humming?
~01~~panel_013~2_goofball=I do! I think ... yes, this pile is emanating magic!
