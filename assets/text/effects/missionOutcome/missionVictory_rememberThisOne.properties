~01~~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.personality:We asserted pure dominance today. A tactical achievement. Have to remember what we did.../[face:interested]Hey, you know what? That wasn't so bad. Was it? Did kind of black out. But I'll remember this part./[face:joke]Not so tough, was it? No really gross wounds, which is disappointing. But I'll remember this one.../[face:skeptical]We came out losing very little. Some rips, scuffs, and notches, but mostly clean. That's a worthy day's work./[face:happy]Want to remember this one. No bad wounds. Barely even a sour face. Doesn't get much better./[face:happy]Now [i]that's[] a thrill. Fight like mad and come out clean? That's when you know you're meant for this!/[face:happy]That's something to be proud of. Hard fought. No real awful wounds, no one lost. A day to remember./[face:skeptical]Everyone come out of that mostly clean? They're more talented than I thought./The legendary warrior, <npc.fullname>, said of choosing <npc.mf:his/her/their> battles: 'Leave a field you're unafraid to look back on.' We did that today, I think./[face:talking]You ever read those stories? I did. The great heroes. Sun in their hair, reavers dead by their feet. I'll remember this one./[face:skeptical]I usually have a lot more to criticize. But I think we did pretty well today. I [i]earnestly[] think so...>
~01~~panel_001~2_ship=<ship.rfln.hook:You'll mock me, but.../You know me./You know how I get.../Something about me.> <ship.personality:[face:skeptical]I don't trust simple successes. Irrational as that may be./[face:interested]Good days are what worry me most./[face:joy]I'm not at ease when things go easy./[face:skeptical]Success just makes me anticipate the price of failure./[face:interested]If I could make everyone survive every battle... I'd die for that./[face:skeptical]Easy victories, peaceful respites. This stuff gets me antsy./[face:neutral]I'm only thinking of the challenges that come after./[face:grim]Want to tell everyone to stop now. Make homes and families. That I'll do it alone from here./Triumph, to me... it's too fleeting. I can't enjoy it./I fell in love with tragedy, young. I'm waiting for the awful twist.../Feel like we're ants who've killed a spider... on top of an anvil.>

~01~~panel_002~2_ship=<ship.personality2:I'm not even sure if it's logic or superstition. Just seems like... odds dictate it won't always be this clean. We're going to lose someone. And then it'll happen more and more.[face:skeptical]/The fighting, the trails and turns, the accidents.[face:interested] You know... any of us could go. At any time. The good days heighten that feeling. Like you've got a certain number of good days... and you've used one up./[face:skeptical]I don't want to dwell on the negative too much, but... No, you know what? I won't! Come on. <hook.whm:Wipe off your sweat and peel off your battle-socks./Let's get going, gangles!/Put on your wizard-shoes and we're off!> Hopefully, we're headed back to <town>./Today was like throwing straight sixes. Feels nice in the moment, but when it's done... you wonder if you've used all your luck up. There's always another roll of the dice. Tomorrow. Next <season>. And on.[face:neutral]/[face:talking]When things are at their best, they've only got one direction to go, after all. Oh well, it's not worth salting a sweet taste. Today, we all get to walk away, and that's enough to be grateful for./[face:skeptical]You just think of all the stuff that's out there. Evil, yeah. Or just hungry. Could come rampaging into our midst and take one of us away. Makes me frustrated. How fragile we all still are.../[face:talking]And this victory gives us confidence, but you suppose it might give us too [i]much[]. We might slip up. It's always a possibility. That's what I start to worry about, honestly. Why days like this aren't all good./[face:neutral]We [i]could[] all just go our separate ways. Today. You ever think that? Today, we did the best we could hope for. Let's be content with that, and go live our well-earned lives. Don't you almost want to?/[face:neutral]But that's... Anxiety is a prison. A prison we walk around in, constantly. Comes with us, hangs over us. Days like this almost make it... tighten... Just because we know things [i]have to[] get worse./[face:interested]I used to imagine I'd be a hero they'd tell stories of. You tend to forget that half the stories are tragedies. A day like this... reminds me of both those things./And yeah, I sometimes feel inclined to point out the negat... well, no, the [i]necessary[]. Because you all can't just expect to win all the time. Someday... we won't.>
