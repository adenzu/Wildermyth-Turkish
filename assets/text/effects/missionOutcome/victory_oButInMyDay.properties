~01~~panel_002~1_romantic=<deadHero.exists:<romantic.personality:We don't know where dead spirits go. My mind says nowhere, but I've seen so many impossible things./[face:sad]The dread of death drives you to survival. But the pain of seeing it swallow everyone you knew...?/Chases the laughter from your lungs doesn't it? Yeah, and sets traps inside, for when the laughter returns./I often ask myself why I don't retire. Unfinished business, you know? But it'll always go unfinished./I used to try to save everyone. Now I only hope to save someone./<romantic.poet.60:Vengeance becomes your waking breath. And sorrow your night's last cup./The fire that drives you... It's the voices of your absent friends. They spur you on, when youth is gone...>/We carry on. Carry the ones we've lost along with us. We're stronger, because we have to be: the weight of our duty only ever grows.../The dead no longer care.../To grow old in this profession is the strangest fate. You begin to wonder whether you yourself have become the ghost./They leave us, but they're not gone. I go to bed with ghosts. They dream through me./I'd take the place of the dead, but even death doesn't want me. I keep going.>/<hero.coward/60:<romantic.personality:History is written by the survivor. That much, I've certainly learned./I used to think so, myself.../[face:interested]The more you worry, the more fragile you'll become. Keep it light if you want to live long./Simply surviving is a pretty low bar. When I was young, I [i]wanted[] things.../I'd rather have died at your age, if it meant others wouldn't have to be here today. Still fighting./You're too young to be afraid./Keep looking out for your life, young one. Count on your friends, and [i]protect[] them./I'm no longer sure./There are worse things to lose than one's life. Believe me, or don't. In fact, I hope you never think me more than a fool./There's surviving, but then there's [i]living[]. I hope you do some living, while you're young./Imagine [face:dubious]having such a simple understanding of loss. Damage. The dragging years. Huh.>/<romantic.personality:History ebbs and flows. The strong fall into weakness, and from frailty is bred ferocity. Burnt skulls are buried in weather./New horrors arise. Respect them. Those who won't pay tribute in fear end up paying in blood. And get too easily forgotten./[face:skeptical]I used to laugh easily about such things. But I learned not to do so under a wild sky.../I was cocky myself. Eager to take what I could, and celebrate my victories. Look at me now./I remember others like you. Dirt under my nails still... from burying them. I hope you find wisdom./You should've seen [i]us[] in our primes. In my best days, the oceans feared me. I was better than my pride even supposes./I learned it as I aged: you're flimsier than you expect. No, it's the strength of your friends. [i]That's[] what you have to trust./The greatest dangers have \nalways been the quietest./In my youth, I believed in my own <romantic.whm:hands. I had skill and strength./strength. My bow, my soft speed./mind. My insight, my force of will.> Youth's best tools go dull. Trust only in your capacity to love./When I was young, I also confused pride for strength. Pride will strand you, someday. And you'll fall if no one can save you./[face:skeptical]<participant.exists:<participant.7ysoThan.hero:You/You/These> young people/You> [i]are[] scary. Reckless fools. Luckily, I was never young...>>>
