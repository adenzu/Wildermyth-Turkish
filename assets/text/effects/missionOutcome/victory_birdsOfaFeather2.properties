~01~prompt~panel_002~1_npc=Please! Help me!
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_leader=<healer.loner/goofball/60:Are you... okay?/Congratulations! You've been rescued by <company>./Lucky for you we happened by. >
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_healer=Where are you from? We can escort you back.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_npc=I ... I have no home anymore.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=They came upon us at night. Swooping in like vultures. They killed everyone. My friends, my family ...
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_narration=I don't know why I was spared, and I've lost track of time. Perhaps they meant to keep me as a meal.

~04~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_npc=I ... maybe you're right.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_leader=Welcome to <company>!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_npc=Thank you! You won't regret this!
