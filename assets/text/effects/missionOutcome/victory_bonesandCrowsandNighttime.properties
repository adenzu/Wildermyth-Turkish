I'm mostly, in my head... organizing the seasons in front of us. Towards another peacetime./I'm often like this. Don't think about it too much./[face:skeptical]You'd think there's something wrong with me, huh? No, I'm just feeling dramatic, I guess. Stars [i]are[] nice, tonight./I just like this, sometimes. A good long look into the hollow of night. When the moon's away, you can see stranger stars.>/<hero.bookish/hothead/loner/poet/snark/60:It's a side-task, I sometimes do. Charting where the gleams and planets go. People have [i]interests,[] you know?/[face:dubious]Ah, whatever. Bring wine, then. Join me. Sing a brassy song if you want./Go laugh by the fire if you want to laugh. You'll startle the whole world awake./[face:talking]Whatever's inside us, I feel like part of it comes from there.

I didn't have any the other two nights. I was... Sorry. I'm just waiting for these nights to turn. I got cold./Wine is fruit that's been taught waiting. It bides its time until it's needed. If it's gone, someone must've needed it./[face:skeptical]No one was drinking it. Look at me, <hero.10ysoTHAN.hero2:I'm just a puppy, next to you. I'm not used to hardship. You want me to lose my mind out here?/don't I look bad? We may be about the same in years, but you're the... the ironhearted type. I'm just me./I'm older. I've earned my cups. I've earned [i]bottles[] of cups.>/No one argued for it. [i]What?[] Let's wrestle in the starlight, then. I've got a little more fight in me. Before bed./[face:happy]I offered some to the first star I saw. And then all these others showed up. I couldn't just say [i]no[] to them.>/<hero.bookish/coward/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:Fatigue. Settling in our bodies. Corrupting our clarity of thought. Sometimes, when I want to be held up by something, I look at the nighttime./[face:interested]Should I say yes? Would I sound brave and brooding if I said just...[i] 'Go to bed.'[] I don't know. I can't really tell you anything. Tonight./I'm just out looking at stars again. I'm fine./[face:talking]So said the moon to the darkness tonight, and did. But you can hover next to me. Glow on me, if you can. I won't mind./It's [i]hard[] leaving me alone, isn't it?[face:happy] \nI'm that kind of <hero.mf:man/woman/person>./Stop badgering me all the time.

The stars are nice.>/<hero.bookish/greedy/healer/leader/romantic/60:[face:talking]How far do you think they are? The farther you guess, the larger you're asserting they are. To be shining like that./Maybe you're like me. You'd like to fetch one down? Or maybe you'd like to travel there. I'm not [i]that[] ambitious./It's good to have those teasing sorts of thoughts. I just think of home, sometimes. And it's the same thing./I wish I was as imaginative as that, sometimes. But then I might not appreciate hearing these things from [i]you.[] It's getting late, though./<hero2.loverOf.hero:Come touch me. There're stars on my cheek. And one in my mouth. Come taste it.[face:talking]/<lover.exists:<lover> and I hang notes on the stars for each other. No one can read them.

These trees are nowhere near as old as the stars./[face:joke]Owl and Star were married, once. And that's why they live so distantly, today. [i]Tonight,[] I guess I mean./Mm. That's the story. Maybe I'll try and gamble her for her jewel. A mother owl, I mean./[face:grim]Forests are afraid of their owls. Like any village would fear a roosting killer./[face:talking]I always took that to mean... owls are lonely. Lovelorn. Exiled, maybe, from a cosmic country./Owls vomit bone-wads. So. Remember who you're talking to. And about.[face:neutral]/It's nice to imagine a thing like that. Whatever it ends up meaning.>/<hero.goofball/hothead/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:happy]How many stars can you fit in an empty bottle? \nHave you ever played that game?/[face:grim]If you've got a problem, say so./Someone cares, I'm sure, when you talk your belittling way.
