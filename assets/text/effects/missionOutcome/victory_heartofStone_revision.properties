I wonder whether I'll continue... to pay a price. Maybe/[face:skeptical]Who knows? Maybe I'll be a diamond-person, soon. Maybe[face:talking]> it'll travel to my heart. Under my ribs, someday, you'll find only a cold, glittering, impervious jewel.
~01~~panel_005~6_target=<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]Hm. Well. Let's look for soft ground.>
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=Whether it was wrath or reward...
~01~~panel_006~2_narration=...a trap or a twist of coincidence...
~01~~panel_006~3_narration=...will always be hard to tell.
~01~~panel_006~4_narration=Years will show how deep the changes go.
