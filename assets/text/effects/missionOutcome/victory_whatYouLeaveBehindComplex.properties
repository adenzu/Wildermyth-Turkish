~01~~panel_001~1_hero=I think that's the last of them. Damn <foes.plural>.
~01~~panel_001~2_volunteer=They don't die easily. You still in one piece?
~01~~panel_002~1_hero=Well... as much as I ever am.
~01~~panel_003~1_volunteer=<volunteer.healer/leader/goofball/40:\nOh... <hero>, I'm sorry. Sometimes I almost forget. Does it... does it still hurt?/\nOh... <hero>, I'm sorry. Sometimes I almost forget. You don't let it slow you down, do you?/\nOh... <hero>, I'm sorry. Sometimes I almost forget, y'know, that you're a <hero.maimal:one-armed/one-legged/AMPUTEED(ERROR)> wonder./\nOh... <hero>, I'm sorry. Sometimes I almost forget. How are you holding up with it?>
~01~~panel_004~1_hero=<volunteer.healer/leader/goofball/40:\nSometimes. Usually if it's about to rain./\nNot if I can help it, no./\nNice to excel at something. I guess./\nYou know. It is what it is.>
~01~~panel_005~1_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:\nIt was so peculiar. In the moment, I mean. It almost felt like I was watching it happen to me, even as I was experiencing it physically./\nI always knew there were risks, doing what we do. It would keep me up at night, wondering what it would be like to be hurt. Or killed. /\nIt's not a big deal. Really. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything's fine. /\nIt's funny. I've seen people injured before. Maimed, horribly. Worse than this even. And I always tried to help when I could. To be strong for their sake. /\nI got into this to make the Yondering Lands a better place. Threw myself head first into danger so that others could be safe. / \nLook, I knew the dangers when I signed up. If it had to happen to someone, I'm glad it was me instead of you. Or <Volunteer2>. Or <Volunteer3>. /\nI didn't expect it to be so... isolating. People draw away from me because of it. It's not obvious, but I can tell. /\nI spent a lot of time at first feeling sorry for myself. How could this happen to ME? Why not you? Or <Volunteer2>? Or <Volunteer3>? / \nAfter it happened, I kept... trying to find meaning in it. Asking WHY. Did it happen for a reason? A purpose? To teach me or challenge me or test me somehow? /\nIt's funny. As a child, I thought it would be... oddly glamorous to come home with a war wound. A sign for all to see, of battles won and heroic deeds./\nFrankly, some days I almost forget too. I've gotten so used to this thing, I hardly even notice. /\n>
~01~~panel_006~1_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:\nI've always sort of lived in my head more than my body. I guess in that instant, my head needed more distance than usual. /\nSo when it finally happened, it was almost a relief. Don't get me wrong, it was awful... but at least the anticipation was over. /\nI mean, It's not like I'm the first person to lose <hero.maimal:an arm/a leg/A LIMB(ERROR)>. And I won't be the last. So it's fine. Really. Just fine... /\nSo when it happened to me, I just told myself it wasn't any different. That I had to be strong for my own sake this time. /\nAnd what did I get for my trouble?  Maimed. Some better world, huh? /\nIf my <hero.maimal: arm/leg/LIMB(ERROR)> is the cost of making the Yondering Lands safer... it's seems like a small price to pay. / \nI mean, sure, I like to keep to myself, but that's by CHOICE. When other people shun me... I didn't expect that to be so hard. /\nBut eventually I realized that kind of thinking wasn't going to get me anything, so why bother? Haven't really looked back. /\nBut if there is meaning in it, I damn well haven't found it. I guess sometimes shit just happens. /\nEveryone would see my wounds and think, "there goes a hero." But now, having been through it... I kinda wish my heroic deeds could stay unnoticed. /\nUnless I need to, y'know, <hero.maimal:write something down. Or shake hands. Or pick my nose/kick a ball. Or climb a tree. Or put on my pants./DO ANYTHING NORMAL(ERROR)>\n>
~01~~panel_008.(hero_is_bookish)~1_hero=<hero.coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark:\nAnyway. Guess I was lucky I JUST lost my <hero.maimal:arm/leg/LIMB(ERROR).>/\nI feel like I should crack a joke or something to lighten the mood, but I can't think of anything funny right now./\nAt least the stitching is tidy./\nAny other questions?/\nAnyway. We soldier on, right?/\nAnyway, thanks for asking. People don't usually like to talk about it./\nHonestly, it should have been <Volunteer2>./\nSorry.

~01~~panel_019~1_hero=We should probably check the perimeter. Make sure we got them all, huh?
~01~~panel_019~2_volunteer=Yeah.
