~01~~panel_001~2_narration=Night's fallen before the last <threat.singular> lies still. It's a short but weary \ntrek to camp for <volunteer.exists:<company>/<hero> and <ship>>.
~01~~panel_002~1_ship=<ship.leader/coward/snark/hothead/greedy/goofball/60:[face:grim]Only a little further now<volunteer.exists:, everybody./...>/Why's every path [i]longer[] after a battle?/Ah, the glamorous life of a hero./[face:happy]That went pretty well. Almost wish there \nwere more of them./I call dibs on the last of the shroomcakes./I'm gassed. <volunteer.exists:Who wants/You want> to carry me back?/Can we bring our camping gear [i]to[] the fight next time?>
~01~~panel_003~2_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/leader/loner/romantic/healer/goofball/60:<ship.leader/coward/snark/hothead/greedy/goofball/60:I think you mean [i]farther[]./[face:grim]Are you even familiar with the basic concepts of geometry?/[face:skeptical]I sometimes suspect you've never actually read The Travails of <npc.fullName>. [i]Glamorous[] hardly describes it./[face:dubious]And why is that, exactly? You think there's some benefit to [i]grinding[]?/Ah yes, we've reached the dib-calling stage of the evening./I'm going to assume that's your attempt at humour./[face:skeptical]I sometimes suspect you've never actually read The Travails of <npc.fullName>. Thereâ€™s a whole chapter on that.>/<ship.leader/coward/snark/hothead/greedy/goofball/60:[face:interested]I wish you'd stop saying that. You're practically asking to get ambushed./[face:interested]Wait, are they? Is that a thing?/[face:grim]Least we're alive./[face:interested]Why would you ever say that?/[face:interested]Are those even safe to eat? Didn't half of <town> fall sick last year...?/[face:interested]Wait, is that an option?/[face:interested]Then I can guard the camp stuff while <volunteer.exists:the rest of />you fight?>/<ship.leader/coward/snark/hothead/greedy/goofball/60:I just said that. Are you copying me?/You're not making it go any faster with talk like that./[face:skeptical][i]Some[] of us aren't in this for the glamour./[face:skeptical][i]You[] got lucky. If you didn't have <volunteer.exists:<volunteer>/me> around to bail you out.../Dibs, again? We refuse to take \npart in this economy of [i]dibs[]./[face:skeptical]Always expecting others to pick up your slack.../Oh right. And lose any chance of suprising our foes. Sounds great.>//You're ruining it. Can't a <hero.mf:guy/girl/person> stargaze in peace?/<ship.leader/coward/snark/hothead/greedy/goofball/60:Ease up, will you? <volunteer.exists:We're tired./I'm tired.>//May not be glamorous, but at least we're alive./Don't be a glory hog. Isn't it enough that we came out alive?/Do you ever think about anyone but yourself?/Do you ever think about anyone but yourself?/[face:skeptical]>/<ship.leader/coward/snark/hothead/greedy/goofball/60:[face:happy]Oops. Forgot to warn you not to step in the ox manure./[face:joke]It's a common phenomenon known as after-battle <ship> syndrome./[face:happy]Oops. Did you step in that ox manure?/[face:interested]Huh. So you [i]like[] <threat.plural>?/[face:happy]Too bad I ate them all this morning./[face:joke]Nope. Not if you're a gasser./[face:happy][i]Ooor[] we could bring the fight to our camping gear!>/You say that every. Single. Time.>
~01~~panel_004~1_hero=<volunteer.exists:<hero.loner/bookish/snark/60:Sleeping now./Peace at last./Peace at last./Goodnight, gang.>/>
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=<volunteer.exists:While the others divvy up last night's leftovers, <hero> heads straight to bed./<ship> makes a meal of last night's leftovers, but <hero> heads straight to bed.>
~01~~panel_004~4_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:<volunteer.greedy.60:So I can have your share of the crustybits?/>/>
~01~~panel_005~2_hero=<hero.personality:Wish I had something to read. Not that I'd be able to focus with <ship> bothering me./[face:grim]I hope <ship> remembers to put the food away. <ship.mf:Does he/Does she/Do they> know this's bear country?/<ship>'s blanket smells like dog hair. Is that what it's made of?/[face:interested]I wonder if <ship> would notice if I switched pillows?/<ship>'s blanket needs mending. Not that it's any of my concern./[face:default]Phew. Good thing we made it. <ship> came [i]this[] close to getting a kick in the pants./This place is a mess. <ship>'s been shirking <ship.mf:his/her/their> duties again./Wish I didn't have to sleep next to <ship>'s smelly blanket. Ah, to have my own tent.../[face:dubious]Ah, a few hours' respite from <ship>'s inanity./[face:interested]Maybe I'll meet <lover.exists:<lover> in my dreams.../<hero.awm:some bewitching beauty in my dreams.../some brooding beefcake in my dreams...>>/What happened to [i]<ship>'s[] blanket? Did <ship.mf:he/she/they> get hungry?>
~01~~panel_006~2_narration=<hero.mf:His/Her/Their> body droops, the day's toils felt in every ligament.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=Until at last...
~01~~panel_008~1_speech=Welcome.
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=...troubles melt like honey flakes.
~01~~panel_008~3_hero=<hero.personality:[face:surprised]Is that the lost cheese of Tenderthorn?/[face:interested]Where's [i]this from?[] Is it for me?/[face:surprised]Ooh! Look at the size of that gobbler!/[face:interested]So this's all mine, right? \nDon't have to share?/[face:happy]Nothing beats a hearty meal. This's wonderful!/[face:surprised]So... you a gambling dummy? Bet I can eat all this in one go./[face:default]A feast? What's the occasion?/[face:interested]Oh... um, hi there./[face:happy]The aroma itself nourishes me.../<lover.exists:A feast? For me and <lover>!?/<hero.awm:Are you going to transform into a bewitching beauty?/Are you going to transform into a brooding beefcake?>>/[face:skeptical]Looks enticing. But what's the catch?>
~01~~panel_009~1_speech=<hero.personality:And these are the mystical gems <npc.fullName> once held./Everything is for you, <hero>. Relax and enjoy!/And what does every good party need?/Unless you would care to invite <ship>?/Not as wonderful as you, <hero>./You win. Have some jewels?/These are your just desserts, brave <hero>./Do not be shy. I am only a dummy./[i]Your[] aroma nourishes [i]me[]./<lover.exists:Perhaps <lover.mf:he/she/they> would like these, too. Or.../Well, actually... yes.>/No catch. Unless you would [i]like[] there to be?>
~01~~panel_009~2_hero=<hero.personality:[face:default]<ship> doesn't know the value of things like this./[face:interested]<ship>'ll be kind of jealous, right...?/Butterflies!! And plus, \n<ship> isn't invited!/[face:happy]Nope. <ship.mf:He's on his own./She's on her own./They're on their own.>/[face:default]But... <ship> [i]does[] like this kind of thing./[face:joy]<ship>'ll be so mad!/[face:joke]I do deserve [i]something[] for putting up \nwith <ship>, don't I?/[face:interested]Your words, not mine. So... \nNo <ship> here, right?/[face:interested]Oh. My soap, right? <ship> hates it. \nBut I make it myself./<lover.exists:And <ship>'s not here to spectate./[face:joke]<ship> should see us together!>/[face:interested]Uh, no. But I guess <ship>'s not going \nto pounce and eat it all?>
~01~~panel_010~1_hero=<ship.greedy/coward/romantic/leader/healer/poet/loner/60:More likely <ship.mf:he's/she's/they're> sneaking a second helping from the food supply./Guarding? Are we talking about the same <ship>?/Guarding? Hmph. I bet <ship.mf:he's/she's/they're> sneaking away for a midnight rendezvous./Of course. Even with the <threat.plural> dead, <ship.mf:he/she/they > can't give it a rest./Or cooking up nasty medicines to force on unsuspecting townspeople./Long as <ship.mf:he's/she's/they're> not singing to the moon./<hero.loner.60:No, I don't actually care./My eye. Bet <ship.mf:he's/she's/they're> just slouching around, acting impossible.>/What for? We killed the <threat.plural>.>
~01~~panel_010~2_speech=<hero.loner.80:<ship>? Why <ship.mf:he is/she is/they are> guarding the tent even now!/Speaking of <ship>, looks like <ship.mf:he is/she is/they are> still guarding the tent.>
~01~~panel_012~1_thought=<ship.mf:Is he/Is she/Are they> in trouble?
~01~~panel_013~1_ship=Got something against <hero>?
~01~~panel_014~1_ship=<ship.hothead/leader/coward/loner/goofball/60:[face:grim]Pfft. If you want a [i]real[] fight, I'm your <ship.mf:guy/girl/person>!/Look, <hero.mf:he/she/they> may be a pain in the eye, but <hero.mf:he's/she's/they're> [i]my[] pain in the eye./[face:sad]Always knew <hero.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> be the death of me.../[face:grim]<hero.mf:He's/She's/They're> asleep. Now will you leave me alone?/[face:skeptical]You <hero.mf:his/her/their> old <hero.awm:girlfriend/boyfriend> or something?/[face:skeptical]Pfft. Get in line.>
~01~~panel_015~1_ship=<ship.coward/hothead/60:[face:sad]Can you just...make it quick?/You don't scare me!/Glare all you want.> I'm not letting you through.
~01~~panel_016~1_actionSmall=[red][actionSmall]
~01~~panel_017~1_ship=[navy][action]Aagh!
~01~~panel_018~1_hero=<hero.hothead/60:[face:angry]Hey! Wait!/Hey! Wait!> <ship.mf:Why's he/Why's she/Why're they> moving so slow?
~01~~panel_019~1_hero=<hero.coward/60:[face:scared]Ugh! Why can't I...\nmove...my...limbs.../Ugh! Why can't I...\nmove...my...limbs...>
~01~~panel_021~1_ship=Gah! What're you shouting for?!
~01~~panel_022~1_hero=<ship>? <ship>!
~01~~panel_023~1_hero=Oh, um...
~01~~panel_024~1_hero=<hero.personality:[face:skeptical]Amazing. Must've had a vivid dream./[face:interested]Was it a dream?/[face:joke]Nothing!/[face:interested]Nothing. Just some crazy dream./[face:happy]I see. Must've had a bad dream./Crazy dream. About a gambling dummy./[face:default]Just doing my daily check-in./[face:grim]Nothing./[face:interested]A dream is what I guess it was. The kind that feels realer than waking./[face:joke]Sorry? Thought you were someone else./[face:skeptical]Your blanket looks weird.>
~01~~panel_024~2_ship=[face:dubious]Right. Well, make yourself useful. \nI want griddlecakes.
~01~~panel_025~1_hero=<hero.healer/60:[face:skeptical]Maybe I'll patch up <ship.mf:his/her/their> blanket. Later, when no one's looking./[face:skeptical]<ship>... would you really throw your life in front of mine?>
