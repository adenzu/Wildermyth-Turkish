~01~prompt~panel_001~1_target2=<target2.greedy.80:Not a bad day's work! Lighter on the spoils than I might have liked, but a growing reputation has its own value./You know, I'm really proud of us. All that training is starting to pay off.>
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_target=More importantly, the people of <site> can rest easy now they're free from—
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_speech=[large][italics]<npc3>!![][]
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_target2=Oh, <npc3>, <npc3>! My darling <target.mf:son/daughter/child>! You've come back to me!
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_target2=<target>, do you know this—?
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_target=No! I've never—
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_speech=Don't be silly! I haven't grown that old in all the years you've been away!
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_target=So...I take it you're not <npc3>?
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_target=No! Who is this <npc.mf:man/woman/person>?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc2=We don't know. <npc.mf:He/She/They> turned up here one day, weeping and wailing. We think <npc.mf:his/her/their> village must have been destroyed, or Thrixl have been in <npc.mf:his/her/their> head. Or both.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_npc2=<npc.mf: He/She/They> couldn't tell us anything except <npc.mf:his/her/their> name—<npc>—and that <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> waiting for <npc.mf:his/her/their> <target.mf:son/daughter/child>, <npc3>, to come home. We cared for <npc.mf:him/her/them> as well as we could and hoped <npc.mf:his/her/their> family would find <npc.mf:him/her/them> someday.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_target=It's too bad you're not really <npc.mf:his/her/their> <npc3>.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_target2=<target2.poet/greedy/60: <target>, this tale is a tragedy, but you're not obligated to become a player in it./  <target>, this <npc.mf:man/woman/person> has no claim upon you. You needn't spend your precious moments of free time shoring up this delusion./<target>, even a hero isn't called upon to shoulder every burden <target.mf:he encounters/she encounters/they encounter>.>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_target=<target2>'s right. <target.goofball/snark/greedy/hothead/loner/80:Not my problem./Not my problem./Not my problem./Not my problem./Not my problem./A lie born of pity is still a lie.>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_target=It might be... nice... to be someone's child.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_target=Look at me more closely, <npc>.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_target=I'm not <npc3>.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_target=I'm sorry.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_npc=No, you're not, are you.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_npc=I'll keep waiting until <npc3> comes home.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~2_npc2=It's all right. You go on. We can take care of <npc.mf:him/her/them>.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_narration=Many days later...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_target=They'll take good care of you while I'm gone. And I'll come back to visit between missions..
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_npc=Promise?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_target=I promise, <npc.mf:Father/Mother/Parent>.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_healer=Seems to me more than one heart has been healed in <site>.
