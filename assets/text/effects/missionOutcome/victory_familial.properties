~01~~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.personality:\n<hero2.bookish/80:[face:talking]Isn’t it satisfying to become one of the <hero.whm:warriors/hunters/mystics> we used to read about together?/[face:happy]I always assumed you went along with those lessons growing up because you had to… but you appear to have retained more than I would’ve thought.>\n/[face:interested]I still worry. But I’m never [i]not[] going to worry about you, you know that. So don’t take it personally... it’s not a reflection on your skill.\n/[face:joy]You’re quite a force! I’ll take you out for honey-rolls when we get back to civilization, eh? ...Do you still like those?\n/[face:joke]Good to know I passed along at least some of the prowess.\n/[face:interested]I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to seeing you in harm’s way. I can try though. You’re giving it your all, so the least I can do is try.\n/[face:grim]See? Now aren’t you glad I didn’t just [i]let[] you win all the time when you were younger?\n/[face:talking]Not that you need my praise at this point... but you fight well.\n/[face:talking]I wouldn’t want to call you out in front of a crowd, but you’ve come so far. I’m immensely proud.\n/[face:talking]When our ferocity and vision span generations, only then are we truly unstoppable.\n/[face:interested]In my younger days, I envisioned someday fighting alongside my own <hero2.mf:son,daughter,child>. Granted, I didn’t envision <threat.plural> factoring in quite so heavily...\n/[face:dubious]Some parents play Spindlesham to bond with their children. Or they garden. Or they bake desserts...>
~01~~panel_002~1_hero2=<hero.personality:\n<hero2.bookish/80:[face:skeptical]Do you think their arms were as sore after the battles?/[face:interested]Amazing what you can retain when your life literally depends on it.>\n/<hero2.hothead/snark/bookish/80:[face:happy]I haven’t let it stop me yet./[face:dubious]I’ve gotten used to it./[face:skeptical]Hopefully each successful battle can ease it a bit./[face:default]No offense taken.>\n/<hero2.goofball/80:[face:surprised]Are you kidding? Who would turn down honey-rolls?/[face:interested]They’re… I mean, they’re alright.>\n/<hero2.hothead/greedy/snark/80:[face:joke]Some, and then some./[face:joke]Some, and then some./[face:dubious]The Yondering Lands are forever in your debt./[face:skeptical]It's every parent's burden to try. You did as well as anyone could expect.>\n/<hero2.hothead/snark/healer/coward/80:[face:joke]What, I haven’t hardened off your heart yet?/[face:joke]What, I haven’t driven you to total apathy yet?/[face:interested] Well, sure. You think I don’t feel the same sometimes?/[face:interested]Well, Sure. You think I don’t feel the same sometimes?/[face:interested]Better us in harm’s way than others. At least we signed up for it.>\n/[hero.face:happy][face:joke]Don’t pretend it was some noble parenting ploy. You’d never “let” anyone win.\n/[face:happy]I’ll never turn it down.\n/[face:happy]Not sure how I’d respond to that in front of a crowd, anyway.\n/[face:skeptical]It’s not a light thing to carry, but I do what I can.\n/[face:happy]Probably still worth it.\n/<hero2.healer/romantic/poet/coward/80:[face:interested]We could do those too, sometime./[face:interested]We could do those too, sometime./[face:interested]We could do those too, sometime./[face:skeptical]You never told me those were options!/[face:joke]We’re fighting for each other’s lives, what could be more wholesome than that?>\n>
