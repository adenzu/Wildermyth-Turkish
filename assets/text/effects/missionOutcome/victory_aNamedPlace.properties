~01~~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.healer/poet/romantic/greedy:We’ve been very fortunate today. No battle ever promises you that./It may not be tide-turning, but something significant happened here today./It won’t be the last battle, but by my eyes, it was a good one./We accomplished something significant here. We made a statement.>
~01~~panel_001~2_hero=We should name this place.
~01~~panel_001~3_hero2=<hero2.snark/goofball/80:[face:dubious]You mean something like… "<site>?"/[face:joke]You thinking something like… "<site>?"/...You mean "<site>?">
~01~~panel_002~1_hero=Well sure, that’s the [i]overall[] place. But what about a specific clearing or cliff? You think they have names?
~01~~panel_003~1_hero=<hero.healer/poet/romantic/greedy:[face:happy]I bet not. I bet they’d love the attention./A thing you name may tell your story, however quietly and slowly./Being in the presence of a named place has a certain beauty./[face:joke]There are all kinds of candidates for honoring a good fight.>
~01~~panel_004~1_hero=Anyway, a little commemoration never went amiss.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=The top of a nearby mound of stone seemed to fit <hero>’s vision.
~01~~panel_006~1_hero=<hero.healer/poet/romantic/greedy:It practically calls out for a name. Don’t you feel that?/A perfect vessel, strong enough to hold even weighty memories./Perfect. Rarely does your heart confirm something so decisively./It’s the most majestic place we’re going to find without having to walk much more.>
~01~~panel_007~1_hero=<hero.healer/poet/romantic/greedy:I’d been thinking on this for a while, and [i]“Victory’s Guard”[] feels appropriate./[i]”The Earthen Witness”[] takes its name this day./[i]”Battlebond Peak”[] sounds like a place anyone would be proud to stand./[i]”Summit of the Righteous,”[] I think. Not over-the-top, but we don’t want to undersell ourselves either.>
~01~~panel_009~1_hero2=You have an... official process for this?
~01~~panel_010~1_hero=One makes one’s own. <hero.greedy.80:After all, who’s going to tell me otherwise?/The place will know.>
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=<hero> lit a tiny fire on the crag as the sun stretched out, building small piles and saying a few words. <hero2> wondered if <hero.healer/poet/romantic/greedy:<hero.mf:he was/she was/they were> talking a little too animatedly to the rock./<hero.mf:he/she/they> just enjoyed the motions of a ritual a little too much./<hero.mf:he/she/they> just enjoyed the motions of a ritual a little too much./<hero.mf:he was/she was/they were> just in it for the sense of self-importance.>
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=But when <hero.mf:he/she/they> came back down, something did feel different.
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=The company took a moment to <hero.healer/poet/romantic/greedy:take in “Victory’s Guard”/acquaint themselves with ”The Earthen Witness”/regard ”Battlebond Peak”/admire the newly-dubbed ”Summit of the Righteous”> on their way out...
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=...then continued on, hiding small smiles from <hero>.
