~01~~panel_001~2_ship=<ship.exists:<ship.rfln.romantic:You're a force of your own, <romantic>, I'll give you that. <ship.healer/hothead/60:Just [face:skeptical]try to stay a little more under control next time./[face:angry]But stay out of my way next time./[face:skeptical]If it weren't for your other eccentricities...>/<ship.goofball/leader/poet/60:[face:happy]You know what I was thinking? Pancakes. You don't \nmake pancakes anymore. What's with that?/[face:grim]Always a few more we can bury./[face:grim]Like wheat flocking to the blade of the scythe. \nThey keep coming for us. We keep cutting./[face:skeptical]Guess we knew that was coming, didn't we? Ruins and old swords and what not? Always comes with a fight.>/<ship.coward/loner/60:[face:interested]I don't know how you get us through, but you always do./[face:skeptical]We're getting too good at this, aren't we?\nYou think we'll die this way?/[face:happy]You were magnificent, love. You alright?>/That's the last of them. You alright there?>/>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Behind <romantic.mf:him/her/them>, a powerful radiance envelops the sword.

Never returned it./<romantic.greedy/loner/60:[face:skeptical]And always makes me question my choices...

The way my blood jumps when I see you embroiled in combat. <ship.whm:Your whirling body.../Your taut focused lips.../Your swirling clothes...>/<ship.coward/loner/60:[face:happy]Sounds like a certain hero deserves <romantic.mf:his/her/their> lustful kiss!/[face:joke]I've never been one to die in combat. Not [i]so[] far, anyway.../[face:joke]You can go ahead and kiss me, if you want. And even if you don't!>/[face:happy]I'll never let you fall.

~01~~panel_004~1_narration=The brilliance is blinding. \nSound is muffled. Then...
~01~~panel_004~2_ship=<ship.exists:What's it...?/>
~01~~panel_004~3_romantic=Oh!
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=Not alone.
~01~~panel_005~2_npc=You're strong. You and your friends.
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=<romantic> is somewhere else.
~01~~panel_006~2_romantic=Oh...
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=The <npc.mf:man/woman/person> appears solid, but motes of spectral dust waft from <npc.mf:his/her/their> skin, <npc.mf:his/her/their> armor.
~01~~panel_008~2_romantic=You're... are you <npc.fullname>?
~01~~panel_008~3_npc=Mm, yes. I was.
~01~~panel_009~2_npc=Weren't expecting such a beauty, were you?
~01~~panel_011~3_npc=I once carried this sword, Avenger. Until I was quite old, we fought and won together. But she never did like to take a life, and I never did like to make her.
~01~~panel_011~4_romantic=She?
~01~~panel_012~3_npc=Oh, sure. She was a spirit once. Her home and mine burned, and that was when we formed our pact. To avenge our families, our homes. To fight long as we could.
~01~~panel_013~2_npc=When my strength was gone, I returned her to rest, here among these stones. But still...
~01~~panel_014~1_romantic=You became a legend. You both did...
~01~~panel_015~3_npc=Still, the land needs heroes. Protectors. Avengers.\nI'm beyond this world now, but I've kept watch. To find those who might carry my mantle.
~01~~panel_016~3_npc=She's eager to run beside you. To grant you her strength, if you'll have her.
~01~~panel_017~5_romantic=I... I don't know what that means. But <romantic.loner.60:I suppose it's.../I welcome help.> If she'll...
~01~~panel_018~1_narration=A sudden flare sunders the fabric of this ethereal realm.
~01~~panel_019~1_narration=The sword is nowhere to be seen.
~01~~panel_019~3_action=[green]
~01~~panel_020~1_narration=<romantic> feels mist against <romantic.mf:his/her/their> eyelids and opens them.

~01~~panel_021~2_ship=<ship.exists:Uh, <romantic>? What just happened?/>
~01~~panel_021~3_action=[actionSmall]hop!
~01~~panel_022~1_narration=The rabbit wiggles her damp nose vindictively.
