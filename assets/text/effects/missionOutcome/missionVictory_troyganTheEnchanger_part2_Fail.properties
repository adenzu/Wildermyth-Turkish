.blurb=...this grim thing might've served us...
.longName=Troygan the Enchanger
.name=Victory
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=The great machine at the back of the hall never stops whirring...
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_bookish=Two orbous green crystals on the face of the aparatus begin to glow.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_bookish=And strangest of all...
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_bookish=[green]...I am Troygan the Enchanger...
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_speech=[green]...does it not speak...?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_bookish=It's. Talking. To me.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/hothead/60:Troygan, am I to believe you are a conscious being? Or more Morthagi clock-wattle?/Um, I'm currently trying to decide whether to start hitting you with weapons, Troygan. Any thoughts?/What do you mean you are Troygan? You?>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_speech=[green]<bookish.bookish/hothead/60:Morthagi...? Ah. <bookish.mf:He/She/They> refers to the Help. No, I am not one of them. Once, I was a Master Maker./Once I was a Master Maker, and I would have shrunk from violence. But I no longer care if I continue. Or if I don't./Troygan Clume is a name that once echoed in marble halls. It meant me. You see, I once was a Master Maker.>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_speech=[green]Now my consciousness lives in these deathless parts and beautiful gears.
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_speech=[green]I am still Troygan, yet I am He no longer. I am the keeper of this Morthificery.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/leader/70:It's a feat of science, or art, or magic. Not sure what to call it./This thing is a lord of the Morthagi. It's dangerous./Morthificery? This thing makes Morthagi...>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_speech=[green]I am capable of helping the wounded and maimed. I can repl--
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_bookish=Can you give life back to the dead?
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_speech=[green]...I cannot.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_speech=[green]But I can replace limbs lost to the body. I can fashion new appendages, truly fine instruments that function better that the designs of nature!
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/healer/hothead/greedy/poet/snark:While I admit, you've piqued my curiosity.../Such a thing isn't possible. Not by any of the healing knowledge I've come across./You dare to invoke my friend's misfortune?/To even stand here listening to you fills me with... I don't know./Won't this be an unblessed marriage of living and dead matter? A crime against creation?/So you think we should bring you our cripples to experiment on, is that it?>
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_speech=<bookish.bookish/healer/hothead/greedy/poet/snark:/[green]Then think of the secrets I could show you.../[green]I only offer my services to help others who fall under the same sorrow.///>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_narration=Accept Troygan's offer...
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_bookish=Destroy Troygan.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_speech=[green]You choose with the wisdom of the Old Ones, who were my brethren.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/hothead:That's what should worry me, right there./That's not a compliment, you know.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_hook=Panels at the base of the hulking machine swing open to show <bookish> a clean and oil-smelling chamber, before closing again.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_narration=Perhaps someone will make use of Troygan... perhaps the hideous machine will only linger untouched in the cold darkness, the aborted dream of a forgotten people. It just doesn't seem right to deny someone a chance, however dubious or dark.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_narration=Darkness falls...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_narration=The machine comes apart under hammers and axes...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~3_narration=...brutal yanks and saws, pulling ropes...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_narration=...and somewhere through it all, the light in those green crystals dies. The thing called Troygan has been forever silenced...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_bookish=And Troygan is not who we'll mourn...
