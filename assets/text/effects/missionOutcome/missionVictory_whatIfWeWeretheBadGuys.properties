~01~~panel_001.(hook_is_greedy)~1_hook=You know, I'm afraid. Afraid the Drauven are more like us than we realize.
~01~~panel_002.(hook_is_hothead)~1_hook=I hate this. I'd rather kill things that don't think back, things without families. The Drauven are too much like me.
~01~~panel_003.(hook_is_snark)~1_hook=Well, that's it for the Drauven. I hope they don't have kids, or spouses or just emotions at all.
~01~~panel_004~1_hook2=<hook.greedy/hothead/snark:I don't get it. <hook2.goofball.50:What if they're people in lizard costumes?/Maybe they think and feel and dream.> So what?/<hook2.bookish.50:You mean you want to kill vegetables?/You're selling yourself a little short here, I'd say. Like, for instance, you don't have lizard-feathers.>/Of course they have those things. What are you being, sarcastic?>
~01~~panel_005~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Don't you ever worry? That we might actually be the bad guys?/Isn't it strange we just wipe them out where we find them? This weird race of thoughtful beings. Don't you feel conflicted about it sometimes?/Come on, <hook2>. If we stop and think for a second... aren't we just as 'evil' as they are?/Isn't it strange we just wipe them out where we find them? Don't you feel conflicted about it sometimes?>
~01~~panel_006~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Well. I've always thought that, you know, who are we to make these judgements? Good, bad? Vigilant, genocidal? It's all about your point of view isn't it?/No. I mostly feel fuzzy and a little bit like singing. But. I mean I understand where you're coming from, too./Well, yeah. I would say we absolutely are. That's part of the whole attraction. Equation I mean. The terrible equation. That we obviously struggle with. All the time./No. I mostly feel fuzzy and a little bit like singing. But. I mean I understand where you're coming from, too.>
