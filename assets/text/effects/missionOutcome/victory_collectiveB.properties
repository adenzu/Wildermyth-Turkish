~01~prompt~panel_002.(deadHero_exists)~1_npc=Was it worth it?
~01~prompt~panel_003.(deadHero_exists)~1_greedy=If you'd asked <deadHero>, I bet <deadHero.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> have said it was. It's why we're out here, right?
~01~prompt~panel_004.(deadHero_is_missing)~1_npc=I think it'll be good for us to have something we all work on for a while. Brings out the best in folks.
~01~prompt~panel_005.(deadHero_is_missing)~1_greedy=Sure, ride that "new project" enthusiasm for as long as you can.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_npc=We want to give you something in thanks.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=We've talked about it a bit. We're low on resources right now, but we're full of [i]possibility,[] so maybe we can give you some of that.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_greedy=How so?
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc=Our old home is a thing of the past. But we'd like to give you the honor of naming the one that will be built in its place.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_greedy=Wait, <site.station>, right?[]

~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_greedy=How about...
~03~~panel_001~1_greedy=Think it'll work?
~03~~panel_001~2_npc=Well enough.
~03~~panel_002~1_npc=Besides, if I left the choice to these bicker-birds, they'd manage to make some huge argument out of it.
~03~~panel_003~1_npc=And that's what we're trying to avoid, right?
~03~~panel_004~1_narration=<npc> sends them off the next morning, deftly swatting away offers of further help from <greedy>.
~03~~panel_004~2_npc=There is one thing you can do, though.
~03~~panel_005~1_npc=Take this spokesbadge. It feels like bad luck to keep the old one, but maybe worse luck to toss it in a creek.
