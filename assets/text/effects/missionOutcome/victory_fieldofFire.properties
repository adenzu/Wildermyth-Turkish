Um, [i]what[]?[face:interested]/Uh, <target>?>> <hero.bookish/goofball/healer/leader/poet/romantic/60:We experience a lot of deviations from normal, but this's one of the more... [i]intense.[]/I mean, you do appear to be on fire? Which... How do you feel about that?/Sorry if it's intrusive, but I feel like we need to understand./We have a moment, if you'll explain./You belong to a different order of nature now? Or what?/Are you some kind of fire-<target.mf:god/goddess/god> now? Or spirit-touched?/Quick summary might be good. What's happened to you?>/>

Whatever presence was there in the altar, the flames. It spoke [i]in[] me more than [i]to[] me. Like the chorus of my primal... ancestry.>

~01~~panel_004.(volunteer_exists).(deadHero_is_missing)~1_target=I heard them offer stories to the altar: Cvawn of the Summer, the Queen of Embers, the sun-thief and the empire of ashes... or softer stories, like that little yarn about the sky and the tree of fire.
~01~~panel_005.(volunteer_exists).(deadHero_is_missing)~1_target=I heard them, these flamekeepers. People who drove their herds and built their shelters here, who poured out their mysteries by this altar they must've carved. And...

I don't know what I can say.>>
~01~~panel_007.(volunteer_exists)~13_target=<target.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/loner/snark/60:Basically, it's an isolated stack of rare and burning legends. My cataloging instinct [i]tasks[] me with its care, even if my body becomes its shelf./[face:interested]I guess that's why I wasn't scared. The stories that arose in me... were toothlessly ancient. And they wanted to give me strength./[face:happy]Anyway, the point is... you're always going to elect to have a fire arm, if you at all can./So maybe, I think, I responded to it... because I [i]wanted[] something. There's been that hollowness inside for a long time. A cold place that wanted heat.[face:skeptical]/You likely won't understand. But I found something I was missing, before. That's kind of just... what it is./Basically, I was chosen? Or I guess I mean, I chose [i]myself.[] Or I'm not totally sure, but I'm also not sure it matters?[face:skeptical]/<target.healer/hothead/leader/poet/romantic:To become a keeper of that flame... It's something I can tend and nurture, that'll also make [i]me[] strong. And help me protect the people that matter./So you get it, right? I had to be part of that. I've got to do all I can, become all I can. You know?[face:talking]/I needed to take that with me. And I was [i]meant[] to be a part of its continuance. Felt like a directive from the universe.[face:grim]/I didn't place my hand in without asking myself seriously what it might mean. You have my word, there./[face:talking]I know it looks startling. But it's kind of... like, alluring, right? Also, I mean, who wouldn't fall in love with the <target.mf:Flameknight/Fire Maiden/Scarlet Flame> of <target.Hometown>?>>
