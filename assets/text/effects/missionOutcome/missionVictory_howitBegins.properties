~01~prompt~panel_001~2_hero=<hero.personality2:[face:skeptical]All you read, <hero>... What'd you expect?/[face:interested]I got through it. I [b]did[] get through it. Will I ever find that unremarkable?/[face:skeptical]That was a serious fight. Can I handle that? Over and over?/[face:interested]This feels awful risky, <hero>. \nYou sure you got this?/[face:grim]Will I ever hit a point when that feels normal? Should I even want to?/[face:surprised]Why are my cheeks still hot? My blood's pounding. Do I love this or hate it?/[face:interested]I'll have to find my role./[face:interested]That's why they fight in groups, I guess... Or I mean, [b]we[] do./[face:grim]Guess I'll get used to that, won't I? <hero>, the hollow-hearted./[face:interested]Ick, that could've gotten ugly. Hope I at least looked the part./[face:skeptical]I've gotten myself into a real mess.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hero=<hero.personality:[face:skeptical]And why can't I recall any useful details? \nAll I can see is... [b]<sponsor.mf:him/her/them>[].

Perhaps even a lovestory.../[face:skeptical]It's the only way. To the life you've dreamed of.\nBut... why am I suddenly picturing [b]<sponsor.mf:him/her/them>[]...?/[face:interested]I'm sure they all went through it, too, though. \nEven... even [b]<sponsor.mf:him/her/<sponsor>>[], <sponsor.mf:he/she/they>.../[face:interested]But what's this energy? Part of me... enjoyed that. \nDo they all get this feeling? Does [b]<sponsor.mf:he/she/<sponsor>>[]?/[face:grim]Seeing [b]<sponsor.mf:him/her/them>[]... Ah, but I have to think about the company. I'm not truly one of them. Not yet./[face:neutral]What I truly [b]didn't[] expect was... \nseeing <sponsor.mf:him/her/them> move... the way I.../[face:interested]I bet it was apparent on my face. The fear. \n<sponsor.mf:[b]He[] was/[b]She[] was/[b]<sponsor>[] was> as calm as a winter lake./[face:happy]Ah, but when <sponsor.whm:<sponsor.mf:he stood/she stood/they stood> immovable, brave, cutting them down, I... I never.../<sponsor.mf:he stood/she stood/they stood> suddenly from the shadows, my heart.../<sponsor.mf:he stood/she stood/they stood> apart... those elegant arms articulated how the world should be.

~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_sponsor=<sponsor.personality:[face:skeptical]<hero.bookish.60:I'd [i]heard[] you were well taught. I didn't [i]see[] that, today./You fight in a way that's clearly [i]unstudied[]. Sloppy.> Focus on fundamentals./[face:interested]I wouldn't look so confident if I were you. Just... saying./[face:joy]That really [i]is[] your name? <participant.exists:I thought <participant> was joking!/Thought it was a joke!>/[face:skeptical]Let's be clear. Stuff we find? You're last in line./It's fine. It's not instinctive for you. Just means you have to work harder./[face:joke]Sure hope that wasn't your [i]best[]. I'll be pulling twice your weight./[face:grim]You put us all in danger, not knowing where to be. Ask for help, next time./[face:neutral]Just saying... You've tried it. Don't be afraid to give up./[face:grim]An unreliable shield is worse than an empty hand. You don't [i]have[] to do this, you know?/[face:skeptical]Your style's ugly. \nTry and work on that. /[face:dubious]Not exactly a [i]natural[], \nare you?>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_darken=[green] Friendship
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_sponsor=<sponsor.personality:[face:interested]Your aptitude is obvious. I'm curious to know how you grew up./[face:happy][i]I[] was scared and scattered, when [i]I[] first started./[face:grim]You'll need a catchphrase if you're going to stay alive./Stick with me. We'll get you some good gear./[face:talking]Had to check in. This work's pretty tough on the soul./[face:talking]Fight like that makes you feel alive, doesn't it?/[face:skeptical]You're new to this? You sure don't show it./[face:skeptical]You did well. That's all I wanted to say./I see <hero.whm:a bear's heart/the wolf/the spirits> in you. You'll be great someday./[face:joke]You'll be celebrated in songs and sighs, someday. But let's talk about who you [i]like[]./[face:dubious]Don't get [i]too[] good. \nI'm nearly obsolete.>
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_darken=[pink]Romance
~04~choice_three~panel_001~3_sponsor=<sponsor.personality:[face:talking]Heard you were familiar with the Great Histories. /[face:interested]I'm... Or, sorry. Yes, I'm <sponsor>. Uhh.../[face:joke]You've probably heard the rumor by now. I'm single./[face:interested]We all have something we want. Curious. What is it [i]you're[] looking for?/[face:talking]You look troubled. Thought I'd help if I could. Can I?/[face:talking]Now you've seen me at work. How'd I do?/[face:talking]You're new. It's probably tough, right? Let's get to know each other./[face:grim]I don't normally, uh... But would you walk with me?/We're stones beneath great mountains. Sometimes we feel overhelmed. Small./[face:talking]Is it just me, or do our eyes keep knocking together?/[face:interested]You [i]do[] know my name. That's a good start. Listen, uh...>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_narration=Slights and competitions, purposeful or perceived, will come to define their relationship.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_narration=<hero> and <sponsor> will grow to be good friends, helping each other through the harrowing times ahead.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_hero=<sponsor.personality:<hero.bookish/coward/60:[face:talking]And I'd heard [i]you[] were particularly well-read about Kyor and Thnarrland. The parallels and [i]contrasts[] have always interested me. Each fading mysteriously, in disparate times and places./[face:interested]I wouldn't call myself an [i]expert[], of course. Well, not of course, I mean, how would you know that? But, um. Kyoren. I read some Old Kyoren. I like the look of it, mostly./[face:happy]Yeah, I've dived in, a few times. Not [i]too[] well read, but I swoon for Thnarric verse and love-testament. You... uh. You read any of that?>/<hero.healer/loner/romantic/60:[face:joy]You sound more anxious than [i]I[] am. But you don't understand, I'm floored by you! Come on, we'll talk more. We'll get comfortable with each other at least./[face:interested]Okay. Well that's good. I'm <hero>. I'm <int:hero.AGE_IN_YEARS>./[face:talking]I suppose that's all you ever [i]need[] to say to win hearts, isn't it? <sponsor>... Let's walk together. I want to learn your mind, see what makes you brave enough for all this./[face:interested]Yeah, I know. I've been wondering why it took so long for us to talk. I... uh. To be honest, you're beautiful, and I... uh. Well, let's walk together?>/<hero.bookish/loner/snark/60:It's something I... had picked up, actually. I kind of have a propensity for... learning. About things. People. Sorry. Um, I sound weird, don't I?/[face:interested]Hm? Oh, I didn't know. I couldn't have asked anyone. Not that I... I mean, I'm happy. I mean, not [i]happy[], I mean, it's good to know. Not [i]good[] good, it's just.../[face:dubious]I didn't [i]hear[] that. Just felt like a fairly safe assumption. But so what, you want to see if we'd work? Fine, we'll try it./[face:joy]I also heard you were decent in a fight. \nHope the [i]'single'[] thing is true.>/<hero.bookish/greedy/poet/60:[face:happy]My answer's kind of boring. Looking to learn, mostly. Satisfy my curiosities, and develop new ones. Delve into places no one's been in a hundred years./[face:interested]Do I have to give just [i]one[] answer? Because I'm looking for everything, kind of. Everything I can get. And hold on to./[face:interested]You're asking me what I'm [i]looking[] for? It's too large a question. It's nothing, and anything, and everything. Isn't it?/[face:skeptical]You know... I don't have an answer ready. Sometimes it's an easy thing to say, but right now... can we talk about it? In town, maybe? Over drinks?>/<hero.hothead/loner/romantic/60:[face:skeptical]Help? I... Feel like I've found my calling. Maybe worried just about the thrill of it, you know? That it might take me over. But hey, you want to walk with me? Let's hear what gets [i]you[] excited./[face:interested]You want to help? Oh, it's... it's fine. I'm not really used to that. Sorry, but, no. Yes. I'll... talk to you. If you're good. I'm fine. Let's talk./[face:joke]If I told you my troubles, would you walk next to me all the while? Because then I'll think of a hundred troubles. I'll sprout new ones by the minute. Am I being too forward?/[face:interested]That's kind of you... I don't know if I have anything worth your concern. But we could still talk, huh? A lot of worse ways to pass a journey...>/<hero.loner/snark/60:[face:interested]You, uh. To tell the truth, I'm not good at this part, but... yeah. Never seen someone fight quite like... you./[face:skeptical]This is a joke, right? There I was flapping around like Spring's first duck, and there [i]you[] were <sponsor.whm:striding through <threat.cdgmt:the cultsworn leeches/those muscly lizard-dogs/the wretched bloodhungry beasts/flying bones and brass bolts/split wings> like some mythical hero!/whipping round and <threat.cdgmt:answering the next attacker/delivering death to another Drauv/plunking the next charging beast-thing/dismantling another bone-a-maton/splatting the next dragonfly> before I could even spot it.../rearranging existence with your... <hero.whm:your what, your [i]eyeballs[]?/body... I mean, not your [i]body[], your.../well, it's still new to me.>>/[face:interested]It was impressive. [i]You're[] impressive. And I mean, not just on the field, but I just... like... I'm saying too much, aren't I?>/<hero.coward/leader/loner/60:[face:interested]Oh... You'd [i]want[] to? Seeing you in action was a little intimidating, but... We could talk. Yeah, I mean, yeah. Why [i]wouldn't[] we be able to?/[face:talking]Absolutely, yeah. I have a lot to learn. Why don't we walk together on the journey back? We'll trade stories, goals, anything./[face:interested]Oh. But I'm boring. I mean, sure, we can talk if you want. I'm just... not good at it. Is that... okay?/[face:interested]We could walk together. My pack's pretty light if you want me to carry some of your stuff. Or, I'm uh... Anyway, yeah. Let's go.>/<hero.goofball/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:joy][i]Me?[] But we're so... I mean, you're so stoic and suave and I'm so... well, [i]look[] at me!/[face:interested]I... sure. Sure. I'm not good at talking but I'm... I mean you make me curious. Or not... is that the right word? Curious. Hm./[face:happy]Talk to me as we go. Teach me. And... maybe we could [i]make[] it a normally thing. If we enjoy it./[face:joke]I [i]would[]. If you asked more directly, maybe. And maybe if you brought snacks?/[face:skeptical]How could I say no to that? I've been waiting for a chance to talk to you. Or I mean... talking's allowed, right?>/<hero.goofball/loner/poet/snark/60:[face:joy]If we're rocks, what am I? A quartz? A geode? There's so many weird implications, I suppose. Here, walk with me, we'll pick a rock for everyone!/[face:talking]True, we're probably pretty insignificant, in the grand scheme of things. But one exceptional person can do more to change the world than a whole town of dim-eyed ordinaries./[face:talking]Yeah, I sense that, maybe. The important thing is possibly just... a single stone shifting changes the balance of a wall, a tower, a peak./[face:skeptical][i]That's[] what you wanted to say? Some vague nature metaphor? And here I thought you were perfect. You certainly... I mean... you [i]look[]... I mean.../[face:interested]And I just wonder when I'll start to feel like a hero, yeah. How long did it take you to... understand, or... develop a kind of... you know. A peace with it?>/<hero.coward/goofball/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested]Oh, no, I...! Well, yeah. Sorry. It's not that I mean to keep looking at you, I just... you impress me? And... what else do I say...?/[face:joy]Eye-knocks? Maybe so. If I'm being forward, you're kind of... hard not to look at. For me./[face:skeptical]Really? No, I haven't been looking at... \nor I've been trying... um./[face:talking]I like that phrase... knocking together. Drawn to strike against one another repeatedly by some natural force, a shared and private magnetism. I feel that./[face:joke]Oh, our eyes do meet, like flint and knife. \nSparks jump, and no one else can see.../[face:skeptical]Knocking eyeballs isn't a very sweet image, you know? But... so alright, maybe I looked your way, once or twice./[face:interested]Are you doing that on purpose? I don't know, maybe I [i]am[] glancing your way a lot. I'm not oblivious, am I...?>/<hero.goofball/loner/romantic/60:[face:happy]Want to walk with me? You seem funny, all the faces you make. If I get tiresome, just point me at a varmint. I'm like a dog, I'll chase it!/[face:interested]Sure, I'll walk with you. Or I mean... Sorry. Was that going to be your question? I'm bad at these kinds of things./[face:joy]Let's walk together. How about that? No need for either of us to say something embarrassing. But I know [i]I[] eventually will.../[face:talking]I wanted to talk to you, actually. Not in a working, practical way, but like... well, you make me laugh. I want to get to know you.>>
