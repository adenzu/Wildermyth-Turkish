~01~~panel_001~1_ship=<ship.coward/leader/greedy:Okay, I admit it! I wasn't sure we'd make it through that one. <ship.rfln.hook:Mock me if you wish./You were scared too. You're just not going to say so./Of course, you're going to pretend it was nothing. But../How 'bout you, <hook>?>/Well fought, <hook>. <ship.rfln.hook:Yeah, I know, you're not asking for my approval. But you were impressive back there./Not that I expect anything less. Just want you to know I appreciate you./Course, I know my <hook.mf:man/woman/person> can hold <hook.mf:his/her/their> own.../You live up to your reputation.>/Well, I'd say that was a success all around. If only there'd been a couple more witnesses to record the deed... <hook.rfln.ship:But of course, <hook>'s too noble for that. Right?/Hey, <hook>, next time we should organize a viewing. Combat-theater, we'll call it./You saw me, didn't you <hook>? Do I get a kiss for that?/You good there, <hook>?>>
~01~~panel_002~1_hook=<hook.rfln.ship:Yeah, great, whatever. <hook.healer/poet/snark:And now we're safe until the next bloody battle breaks out./All is joy and beauty again. All we had to do was kill and dismember living beings./What a glorious thing. A victory. Woo! What a triumph!>/You start to wonder if it's worth it. All this fighting./Oh, <ship>. Are we going to survive this?/You start to wonder if it's worth it. All this fighting.>
~01~~panel_003~1_ship=<hook.rfln.ship:Well, I mean. Argh, what are you whining about this time?/Oh... you do?/What, <hook>? Survive? Are you really going to start talking about...?/Oh... you do?>
~01~~panel_004~1_hook=<hook.coward/hothead/leader/loner/romantic:We may have survived today. But what about tomorrow? The next day? How long until the fight claims one of us? Or eventually, all of us...?/There's a fire in me. Always was one. But more often these days it's flickering. It feels like.../I guess, somewhere in me, a little voice is saying: this will never end. What if this constant battle and strife doesn't end?/Yeah, you're right. Why would you understand?/I used to think... I envisioned fighting for the people, the meek ones, the lost. It was supposed to be glorious, I'd be celebrated, the people would love... well.>
~01~~panel_005.(hook_and_ship_are_rivals)~1_ship=<ship.greedy.50:Yeah, listen. There's nothing so much good or righteous about any of this. It's just our job. Think of it that way, and don't get too high or low. You'll make it./Alright. Well while you fret and wonder, the world goes by. Honestly, I hate to say it, but we need <hook.whm:your fighting arm/your cunning eye/your clever mind> for the battles ahead. Don't let yourself get dug under by <hook.whm:this weak and/a blot of black/a bit of old> pointless doubt.>
~01~~panel_006.(hook_and_ship_are_friends)~1_ship=<ship.greedy/leader:Okay, well. You know I'm not one to offer sage advice. Not for free, anyway. What I can say is... Look out for your own, yeah? That's all that matters. Heck, that's all anyone else is doing. It's survival. Real basic. So don't overthink it./<ship.leader.50:The point, I suppose is that someone has to do it. The danger won't stop just because we're tired of dealing with it. We've got to face it each time. I know you know that. Don't lose heart./You sort of wish, like I do, that none of this was necessary. We all feel that, I think. And if we see a way to make it come true, to bring peace to this country of wishers, we will. Until then... well, we have to keep answering the call, don't we?>>
~01~~panel_007.(hook_and_ship_are_lovers)~1_ship=<ship.poet.50:Huh... Well we're not going to live forever. <ship.coward/leader/greedy:Don't like to think about that, but it's true./Nor would we want to, I think./Much as we might want to...> I'd just say... if we [i]do[] hold on to each other, and keep matching step for step... I bet we make it a lot further than either of us suppose./I can't tell the future, <hook>. I'll say that as long as I draw breath, I won't let you die. Do the same for me, and we... Well, we might pull through anything, right?>
~01~~panel_008.(hook_and_ship_no_relationship)~1_ship=<ship.leader.50:The point, I suppose is that someone has to do it. I know you know that./I don't know. I don't have the answers. Just do our jobs, and hope it works out, right?>
