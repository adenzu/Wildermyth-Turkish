~01~~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.leader.50:Battle's won. But you still feel... the forest grieves./You get the sense... that the forest grieves.>
~01~~panel_002.(ship_is_goofball)~1_ship=Forest-greaves? What sort of bonus do those give? Could use some extra <ship.whm:speed/armor/armor>, myself.
~01~~panel_003.(ship_is_healer)~1_ship=Be nice if pulling out the thorn would close the wound, huh? Sadly, doesn't work that way.
~01~~panel_004.(ship_is_poet)~1_ship=It's like seeing the sadness of the old, isn't it? That's what I'd compare it to. You feel you [i]want[] to help... Not sure you can. Maybe afraid of the responsibility it could land you with...
~01~~panel_005.(ship_NOT_goofball/healer/poet_(75))~1_ship=[face:skeptical]<ship.rfln.hook:<hook>, you hurt bad back there? That face of yours, I can't always tell./Hm? What do you get?/Sorry, <hook>, but... what? You mean these woods here? Right now?/Oh... I'm sorry what?>
~01~~panel_006~1_hook=<ship.goofball/healer/poet/75:<hook.poet.80:I'm not saying anything about a... I mean the general disposition of the woods. There is an invisible sadness.../I mean the woods are sad.>/<hook.bookish.50:Yes, I know. It's nonsense to expect things to get better as soon as we slay the monster. But.../And by that you mean...?>/<hook.snark.50:Uh. I just mean it's depressing, I guess. So... yes?/That's one thought, I suppose. I mean, It's not a human thing, so much. It's not a direct, like... I don't know what it is.>/<hook.rfln.ship:Forests remember. They cling to pain and trauma like people do./I think of the salten mourners. You know how the coastal people will forbid light in the house for a full year when a family member's died? /The, I mean if you look through the trees. Or listen. Feels like peeking through the window of a vacant house./It's something I pick up on sometimes. I think everyone sort of feels it, don't they? Places kind of [i]hold on[] to pain.>>
~01~~panel_007.(ship_is_goofball)~1_ship=Sad woods... Well, I've always thought music was a good medicine for sadness...
~01~~panel_008.(ship_is_healer)~1_ship=<hook.bookish.50:Give it time. Things take time./Just that: when you're cut, you need time to heal. Same with everything.>
~01~~panel_009.(ship_is_poet)~1_ship=<hook.snark.50:Mm./Hm, sure...>
~01~~panel_010.(ship_NOT_goofball/healer/poet_(75))~1_ship=<hook.rfln.ship:<hook.snark.50:Mm./Hm, sure...>/[face:interested]I'd heard of that... <ship.goofball.50:Always wondered how they cook, or like, if they knock heads a lot./>/<ship.poet.65:I know that feeling, I think. It's gone so quiet here./[face:interested]I don't really know, but... I wish I could see the things you do.>/[face:interested]I see... I don't know if I know exactly...>
~01~~panel_011.(hook_and_ship_are_rivals).(ship_is_goofball)~1_hook=Make light of it, fine. <hook.goofball.50:I know I don't take everything seriously myself./> And sure, maybe I'm the one with the problem...
~01~~panel_012.(hook_and_ship_are_rivals).(ship_is_healer)~1_hook=So what you're saying is we shouldn't worry about it, huh? Hope everything just magically fixes itself?
~01~~panel_013.(hook_and_ship_are_rivals).(ship_is_poet)~1_hook=I don't think you understand what I'm saying, though... I mean what I'm [i]really[] saying.
~01~~panel_014.(hook_and_ship_are_rivals).(ship_NOT_goofball/healer/poet_(75))~1_hook=I'm coming back here, someday. I need to tend this place, I think.
~01~~panel_014.(hook_and_ship_are_rivals).(ship_NOT_goofball/healer/poet_(75))~2_ship=Alright...
~01~~panel_015.(hook_and_ship_are_friends)~1_hook=<ship.goofball/healer/poet/75:Oh, we could sing and sing, sure... I don't know. Forests last ages longer than a person. I should stop worrying./Yeah, a wound needs time. But also tending, right? I guess all I mean is... let's not let infection creep in./It's pointless worrying, maybe. Guess I'd just love to see things more at peace.../The forest, I think... has its light out. And I'd like to see it lit again. Hear the birds laugh and catch the blurs of little scampering things.>
~01~~panel_016.(hook_and_ship_are_lovers)~1_hook=<ship.goofball/healer/poet/75:Are you offering to sing me a tune, <ship>? At least might cheer [i]me[] up./I suppose that's true. We could come back in a year or more? See if it needs more tending...?/I'm glad you see it too. I'm just worried, and wondering, and trying to know what's best./I'd just be happy if you'd be willing to... someday, I mean, let's come back here. Try and help the forest. Tend to its pain.>
~01~~panel_016.(hook_and_ship_are_lovers)~2_ship=<ship.goofball/healer/poet/75:And why else am I here?/Why not?/It's one of the things I love about you./I'd love to.>
~01~~panel_017.(hook_and_ship_no_relationship)~1_hook=<ship.goofball/healer/poet/75:You're saying we should sing a jolly song or something? I wish I could believe in that kind of thing.../Yeah, a wound needs time. But also tending, right? I guess all I mean is... let's not let infection creep in./It's pointless worrying, maybe. Guess I'd just love to see things more at peace.../Alright, well... all I mean is that I plan to come back here... and see it turn to laughter again...>
