~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hero=The moment stretches in <hero>'s mind. <hero.mf:He sees/She sees/They see> the shadow of <hero.mf:his/her/their> foe. <hero.mf:He knows/She knows/They know> what's coming. <hero.mf:He/She/They> can lean a little to one side or the other, but it won't change much.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hero=Then <hero.mf:he feels/she feels/they feel> something... a heaviness in <hero.mf:his/her/their> hand. It has a name. [gold]<weapon>[].
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=There's a story, maybe, that it wants to tell.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_narration=And only a sliver of opportunity left to tell it.
~02~choice_defend~panel_001~2_self=[ni]<weapon> breaks[], \n<hero> falls back.
~03~choice_flee~panel_001~2_self=[ni]-2 Health (this campaign)[],\n<hero> falls back.
~04~choice_attack~panel_001~2_self=<hero> dies, deal <int:(10+(2*hero.LEVEL))+floor(((hero.PHYSICAL_DAMAGE_BONUS+hero.POTENCY)/2))> damage

It catches enough of the blow to deaden its impact.>
~05~player_chose_defend~panel_001~3_action=Crack!
~05~player_chose_defend~panel_002~2_narration=Splinters fly as <hero> crashes to the ground.
~05~player_chose_defend~panel_003~2_narration=The weapon's sacrifice has spared <hero.mf:him/her/them> from serious injury. <hero.mf:He'll/She'll/They'll> retreat, and return to fight another day, another weapon in hand.
~05~player_chose_defend~panel_003~4_narration=But <hero.mf:his/her/their> fingers will long miss the feel of that old <hero.weaponType:sword/axe/mace/spear/bow/bow/dagger/staff/wand>.
~06~player_chose_flee~panel_001~2_narration=Indecision grips <hero.mf:him/her/them>. The blow lands. <hero.mf:He tumbles/She tumbles/They tumble> to the ground, gravely wounded, still clutching <hero.mf:his/her/their> weapon.
~06~player_chose_flee~panel_001~4_narration=In the end, <hero.mf:he/she/they> couldn't choose to part with it, even if it meant paying the price <hero.mf:himself/herself/themself>.
~06~player_chose_flee~panel_002~2_narration=<hero.mf:He has/She has/They have> just enough strength to retreat, and will spend the next days tending to <hero.mf:his/her/their> wounds.
~06~player_chose_flee~panel_002~4_narration=Propped up at <hero.mf:his/her/their> bedside, <weapon> will wait, until <hero.mf:he's/she's/they're> ready to take it up again, and let it sing.
~07~player_chose_attack~panel_001~2_narration=<hero.weaponType:The masterwork of an artful smith, it was made to slice and rend./It was made to cut through armor and obstacle. To cleave a path on the battlefield./It was made to clobber. To crush bone and break heads./Its sharp point perfectly honed, it was made to pierce and impale, to deliver death with a single, well placed jab./The masterwork of an artful bowyer, every arrow notched to its string becomes a messenger of death./The masterwork of an artful bowyer, it was made to deliver death with a single, well placed shot./Power ripples from hilt to tip. It was made to deal death with precision./Power surges through its long shaft. It was made for moments like this. To twist the elements against its foes./Power ripples along the slender shaft. It was made for moments like this. To twist the elements against its foes.>
~07~player_chose_attack~panel_001~3_narration=As <hero.mf:his/her/their> foe moves in, <hero> abandons all thought of survival. <hero.mf:He readies/She readies/They ready> a strike of <hero.mf:his/her/their> own.
~07~player_chose_attack~panel_003~2_narration=<hero.mf:He falls/She falls/They fall> into a thickening murk. But in <hero.mf:his/her/their> last moments, a sense of triumph swells in <hero.mf:his/her/their> heart. The last stand of <hero> and <weapon> will not soon be forgotten.
