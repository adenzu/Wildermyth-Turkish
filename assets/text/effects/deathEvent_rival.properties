~04~player_chose_defend~panel_001~2_narration=Truth is many sided.\nRazor edged.
~04~player_chose_defend~panel_002~2_narration=Painful, sometimes, to grasp.
~04~player_chose_defend~panel_002~3_narration=<hero.pcfn.rival:<rival> can't deny life will be simpler, that <rival.mf:he/she/they> won't miss the constant needling or the endless arguments.

~04~player_chose_defend~panel_003~2_narration=Maybe in time <rival.mf:he'll/she'll/they'll> understand, and come to terms with it.
~04~player_chose_defend~panel_003~3_narration=But <rival.mf:he'll/she'll/they'll> need to survive\nthis battle first.
