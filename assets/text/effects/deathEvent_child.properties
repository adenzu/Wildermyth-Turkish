~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.coward/healer/60:<hero> never took survival for granted. <hero.mf:He/She/They> lived cautiously, treasuring the peaceful times, half expecting each battle would be <hero.mf:his/her/their> last. But fighting beside <child> made <hero.mf:him/her/them> a little braver. A <hero.mf:father/mother/parent> will risk a lot to protect <hero.mf:his/her/their> <child.mf:boy/girl/child>./Years ago, <hero> made up <hero.mf:his/her/their> mind to fight, so others wouldn't have to.
