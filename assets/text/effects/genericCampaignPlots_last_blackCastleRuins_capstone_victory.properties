Woebegone, they trudge from the ruin and wander out of knowledge./The great Dravonne dies, and the Drauven warcries fall silent. This is defeat. They recognize it. It's time for them to turn and run./The mighty Gorgon's death puts a tremor in its still-living underlings, and they flee. In the corrupted chests of the animals, there's a slackening of control. At once, they scatter from the ruin and are gone./The mighty matron of these machines shudders still. The ambition that'd lit their Morthagi cores seems at once... depleted. The remainder of them filter from the ruin, disappearing./The Maylen's death resounds in the Thrixl. The Castle casts off stragglers and stranded ones: they're too ambitionless to remain.>
