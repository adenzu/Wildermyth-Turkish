~01~~panel_001~1_narration=<hero> visited, sometimes, the shrine where \n<hero2.exists:<hero3.exists:the company had/<hero2> and <hero.mf:he/she/they> had>/<hero.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd>> left the orphaned Hago.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=The beast had long since grown big and gone its wild way, but the shrinekeeper was always happy to see <hero.mf:him/her/them>. They'd tell stories, and share sunset and holy liquor. Laughing, shouting, praying out loud.
