~01~~panel_002.(hero_is_poet)~1_narration=<hero> wondered what other things “The Earthen Witness” had seen, so <hero.mf:he/she/they> hiked up on a clear night. The fire-smoke swirled into fantastic shapes, though any actual tales proved hard to follow.

~01~~panel_004.(hero_is_romantic).(lover_is_missing)~1_narration=<hero> brought potential sweethearts to “Battlebond Peak.” If the view didn’t do the trick, maybe the tale of the battle would.
~01~~panel_005.(hero_is_greedy)~1_narration=<hero> cobbled together a proud little structure atop the “Summit of the Righteous.”
~01~~panel_005.(hero_is_greedy)~2_hero=I wouldn’t say it does us [i]justice,[] but at least you know you’re somewhere special.
~01~~panel_006.(hero_NOT_healer/poet/romantic/greedy)~1_narration=<hero> left small treasures around "Victory's Guard" for other explorers to find. Perhaps new stories would spring up here.
