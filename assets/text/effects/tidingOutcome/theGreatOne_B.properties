~01~~panel_001~1_narration=<npc4.mf:He/She/They> said their intervention, bloody though it'd been, saved countless lives. <healer.personality:<healer> is comforted by this cold logic, but nightmares erode at even our most well-reasoned assurances./Memories like this make <healer> question <healer.mf:his/her/their> resolve.../<healer>'d forgotten all about it, actually, and hoped to do so again./Confirming the balance was enough for <healer> to rest easy./<healer> was reminded they'd done well, but also that it'd come at a cost./<healer> didn't say so, but <healer.mf:he/she/they> had no regrets, no need for comforting./<healer> deflected the praise, but took blame for the carnage./<healer> didn't have any words, but heard the <npc4.mf:man/woman/person> out./<healer> would long ponder the implications: of preserving many by excising a few./<healer>, who'd wrestled with <healer.mf:his/her/their> actions that day, rested more easily after that./<healer> shrugged. Good to know, but the deed was done, regardless.>
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=<leader> and <healer> were stopped by a passing <npc4.mf:fellow/woman/person>, a former resident of the abandoned village in <overlandTile> where The Great One once feasted.
