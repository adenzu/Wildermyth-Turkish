~01~~panel_001~1_narration=According to <npc>, an ear to the ground is all that's needed to track their quarry.\n<hero2.exists:<hero.themePiece_wolf_head:Even <hero>'s ears are not quite/Not every ear is>/<hero.themePiece_wolf_head:Even <hero>'s ears are not quite/<hero>'s hearing is clearly not>> as sharp as <npc.mf:his/hers/theirs>.
~01~~panel_001~2_npc=[light]All the tiny tremors folks feel? Those are its prints, its pathmarks. \nVibrations almost carry an [i]odor,[] don't you sometimes think?
~01~~panel_002~1_npc=[light]It's a kind of mercy, really. Just that no one recognizes it. \nThe sound, the sensation. The brushing-by breath of oblivion.
~01~~panel_003~1_npc=[light]But don't you also wonder... what are they [i]doing?[] What are they really [i]up to?[] It's the part I can't figure out.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=As the <hero2.exists:<hero3.exists:group/small group>/pair> enters this ramble of woods, trunks all can be heard humming. \nThe sound turns to thunder in the understory, mussing nests and miffing squirrels. \nSpiders drip from above. They swing like drunken pirates.
~01~~panel_005~2_npc=[light]Close, now. Quite close.
~01~~panel_005~3_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/loner/poet/60:[face:neutral]<hero.themePiece_wolf_head:You have a fairly good gauge on what indicates \ncloseness, then? The intensity of the thrum?/At a later point, I'd love to interview you on the specifics of your... [i]sensory experience...[]>/[face:interested]You think so? But... can we...? \nI mean, do we need to [i]dig?[]/[face:happy]Hey! If I hold my teeth this far apart... [i]hear[] that? \nDoesn't it sound like a jar full of chimmerflies?/It's driving me [i]crazy.[][face:angry]/It's really [i]annoying.[]/[face:neutral]'When the earth sings,' said the Fawn poet, \n'the trees will make harmony.'/But how do we reach it? To stop it?>
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=Then the world goes still. Feet feel the absence of rattle, and become briefly confused.
~01~~panel_006~3_hero3=<hero3.exists:[small]Erk!/>
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=<hero2.exists:/Beast and bird voices begin \nringing through the forest.>
~01~~panel_007~3_hero2=<hero2.exists:It stopped? Has [i]this[] happened yet?/>
~01~~panel_008~2_npc=[light]This is what we've been hoping to hear. It pauses. \nHalf a day, maybe, is what we have.
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=The way below is at the bottom of a wet ravine. \n<npc> <hero.themePiece_wolf_head:and <hero> follow their noses down./follows <npc.mf:his/her/their> nose down.>
~01~~panel_009~2_npc=[light]Here.
~01~~panel_010~2_npc=[light]This earthcave was carved by something. A bear? Big badger? Probably just stormfloods.
~01~~panel_010~3_hero=But there in the back, the tunnel...
~01~~panel_011~2_npc=[light]Right.
~01~~panel_011~3_hero=[small]It's still moving?
~01~~panel_011~4_action=[darkGray][actionSmall]...thrumble...
~01~~panel_011~5_action=[brown][actionSmall]...stroosh...
~01~~panel_012~2_npc=[light]It never fully halts. It [i]mills[] around. Remember, anyway. The god can live. <foes.cdgmt:The culthead, that would-be [i]Monarch...[] is who/The Drauven's... [i]tyrant,[] I guess. Is who/The Gorgonlord... Arch-gorgon? That's who/The Morthagi's Matron is who/The Thrixl leader-thing... is who> you need to strike down.
~01~~panel_013~3_hero=<hero3.exists:/<hero2.exists:[small]<hero2.personality:[face:interested]Yeah?/[face:happy]Tough to manage between the two of us./[face:dubious]Come on./[face:dubious]What [i]exactly[] are you expecting?/Yeah?/[face:neutral]Hm. [i]What?[]/[face:neutral]Oh, that's easy. I [i]love[] walls./Yeah. Eyes, ears. Don't know\nhow dark it'll be./This isn't quite [i]that.[] But I \ncatch your meaning./[face:grim]Let's just make sure we can\ndrink to each other./[face:dubious]Yeah. Great point. Totally possible.>/>>
~01~~panel_013~6_hero=<hero2.exists:/Here I go, then. Into the dark. Alone.>
~01~~panel_013~8_hero2=<hero2.exists:<hero2.personality:It's an opportunity to glimpse something few have ever glimpsed./[face:interested]Sure we can't just...? Could we dig a channel? Divert a river?/[face:happy]How far in do you think you could roll a coin? I'll go first./Since we're taking the risk... I'd assume we're entitled to whatever we find down there, right?[face:skeptical]/Have to imagine there'll be a large contingent of them down there.../[face:grim]They've been slithering around in there. Hiding in their little tunnels like little snakes./[face:talking]Hug the walls, I'm thinking. Don't just walk in the middle of the tunnel./[face:neutral]Imagine I'll have to dodge this thing, if I spot it?/To distract the beast long enough that <npc4.mf:he/she/they> could free it from its leash, <npc4.fullname> had to feed it <npc4.mf:his/her/their> arm.[face:neutral]/[face:talking]We'll never not be loved, I think. The people. They'll never refuse to drink to us. Our names in their hearts, candles in the cold./[face:talking]Watch, we come all this way, and it was actually the wolf<npc.mf:guy/lady/person> the whole time. The villain, I mean.>/>
~01~~panel_013~9_hero3=<hero3.exists:[small]<hero2.personality:Yeah, right before it plows into us. How lucky./[face:skeptical]Might be a little tough to manage in a day.../[face:dubious]Move along./[face:dubious]Asking the important questions.../Who knows? But at least we can thin the crowd./[face:skeptical]Yes, tiny snakes. Well said, I guess./[face:neutral]Oh, that's easy. I [i]love[] walls./And even if you don't.[face:neutral]/I'm sure a pig-haunch would've worked just fine./[face:grim]Don't care what they drink to.

~01~~panel_014~2_npc=[light]<hero.themePiece_wolf_head:Howl out to me./Call for me.> If you get lost.
