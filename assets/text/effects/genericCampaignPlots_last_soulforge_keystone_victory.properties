~01~~panel_001~1_narration=At the rear of the passage is a small paneled room, appointed with basic things.
~01~~panel_002~6_hero3=<hero3.exists:<deadHero.exists:/[small]<hero3.bookish/leader/goofball/loner/60:Certainly took a variety of technical skills, to \ncarve this place out, make it comfortable/[face:neutral]<npc> clearly possessed great practical skill./[face:happy]Anyone want to try some cavewine with me?/[face:neutral]Drinking in here alone for the sum of <npc.mf:his/her/their> life./One of these barrels might still be [i]sealed[]...>>>
~01~~panel_002~7_hero=[small]Stones're stacked for remembrance.[]
~01~~panel_002~8_hero2=<hero2.exists:<npc.fullname> was the name? I guess, if you wanted to disappear, this'd be where you'd go./>
~01~~panel_003~7_hero=<hero2.exists:<hero.genericPlots_soulforgeBookfinder:Shelf looks the same. Journal I took seemed the most interesting. <hero.bookish/greedy/healer/leader/poet/60:Which, speaking from experience, likely means there's gems aplenty, if we take our time scouring.../I didn't look that hard, though, I was kind of annoyed there wasn't [i]more.[]/A lot of it's books you'd need to survive. Herbs, woodworking, references. Made me admire whoever lived out of here. The smith, I guess./I'm not the best judge of [i]interesting,[] though, so take a gander.../I'll admit, I didn't stay long: I was looking forward to the <town> taps. I should've respected the uniqueness of the find./There's tradebooks, some myths, some stuff about... uh... awls, probably? [i]Awls?[] Am I saying that right? I didn't look that hard.>/Shelf there's bigger than I expected...>/>
~01~~panel_003~8_hero2=<hero2.exists:[small]<hero.genericPlots_soulforgeBookfinder:[face:interested]See now why you only took one./[face:interested]Makes sense why we only got a sample.>>

~01~~panel_004.(hero2_exists)~10_hero2=Mm!
~01~~panel_004.(hero2_exists)~11_hero=Hm?
~01~~panel_004.(hero2_exists)~1_narration=It's a while that they're down there. And then <hero2> finds a page, loose-leaf, written in the same hand as the old book.
~01~~panel_004.(hero2_exists)~2_narration=It'd been slipped under the bookcase, \nor had fallen there by accident.
~01~~panel_005.(hero2_exists)~2_hero2=It goes blah blah blah, and then...
~01~~panel_005.(hero2_exists)~3_hero2=[light][i]"For my last sleep here, I shall lie with a modicum \nof satisfaction: the Rootqueen is dead."
~01~~panel_005.(hero2_exists)~4_hero3=<hero3.exists:[small]Yeah, [i]that.[] A Rootqueen./>
~01~~panel_006.(hero2_exists)~1_hero2=[light][i]"My suspicions proved true: she was no natural being, no landspirit. Never needed <npc2>'s help, or mine, only preyed on <npc2>'s kindness, and my love."
~01~~panel_006.(hero2_exists)~2_hero2=[light][i]"A Lostling. Either inhabited this husk, or created it wholecloth."
~01~~panel_007.(hero2_exists)~3_hero2=[light][i]"I'm gratified, I'm sickened. The blade I made on that cursed forge killed her."
~01~~panel_008.(hero2_exists)~2_hero2=Yes. On a real rough map. We can find that.
~01~~panel_008.(hero2_exists)~3_hero2=[light][i]"It does not give me <npc2> back. And the wounds those roots drilled in me are deadlydeep. I'm cold now. Destroy the forge, reader, if you have ones you love. Find it where I mark. The triangles are mountains."
~01~~panel_008.(hero2_exists)~5_hero=And is there a [i]mark?[]
~01~~panel_009.(hero2_exists)~6_hero=This <npc> <npc.mf:guy/lady/person> was pretty courageous.[face:neutral]
~01~~panel_009.(hero2_exists)~7_hero2=Yeah. I guess so. <hero2.genericPlots_soulforgeDreamhaver:If my dream meant something,\nour enemies are already there./I have this bad feeling. \nThat our enemies are already there.>
~01~~panel_010.(hero2_is_missing)~10_hero=Ah...
~01~~panel_010.(hero2_is_missing)~1_narration=It's a while that <hero.mf:he's/she's/they're> down there. And then <hero> finds a page, loose-leaf, written in the same hand as the old book.
~01~~panel_010.(hero2_is_missing)~2_narration=It'd been slipped under the bookcase, \nor had fallen there by accident.
~01~~panel_011.(hero2_is_missing)~3_hero=[light][i]"For my last sleep here, I shall lie with a modicum of satisfaction: the Rootqueen is dead."
~01~~panel_011.(hero2_is_missing)~4_hero=[small]There's that name...
~01~~panel_012.(hero2_is_missing)~1_hero2=[light][i]"My suspicions proved true: she was no natural being, no landspirit. Never needed <npc2>'s help, or mine, only preyed on <npc2>'s kindness, and my love."

~01~~panel_013.(hero2_is_missing)~3_hero=[light][i]"I'm gratified, I'm sickened. The blade I made on that cursed forge killed her."
~01~~panel_014.(hero2_is_missing)~2_hero=That's a real rough map, old <npc>. But I think I can... I think I... we'll see.
~01~~panel_014.(hero2_is_missing)~3_hero=[light][i]"It does not give me <npc2> back. And the wounds those roots drilled in me are deadlydeep. I'm cold now. Destroy the forge, reader, if you have ones you love. Find it where I mark. The triangles are mountains."
