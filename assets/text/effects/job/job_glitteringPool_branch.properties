~01~prompt~panel_001~1_bookish=We're almost there! This is the Luminous Stream, according to the Book of Stars.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_healer=The locals called it the Babbling Brook. Are you sure we're in the right place?
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_bookish=Of course I am! Yesterday we found the split rock exactly where the book said it would be.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_bookish=And today we watched the sunrise on the first day of the new moon cast the rock's shadow in this direction!
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_snark=I still can't believe you got me up before dawn.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_bookish=According to the book, we should see...
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_bookish=...The Celestial Falls.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_snark=It's beautiful.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_bookish=Worth getting up at dawn for?
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_snark=<snark.snark/romantic: I mean, they'd still be here if we'd slept in. /I was having the most amazing dream about kissing the [b]softest[] lips, so probably not.> What does your silly book say next?
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_bookish=Now we climb. The pool is at the top of these falls.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_narration=And so they do, pulling themselves up the moss covered rocks, slipping on mist moistened stone. Until finally ...
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_bookish=This is it!
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_healer=Nice view from up here.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_snark=<snark.snark/romantic:This is what we came for?/You woke me from my luscious dreams for this?> It's just a small pond.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_bookish=The book says, "When stars above are mirrored in the pool, then shall you drink of her glory."
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_healer=And that means?
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_bookish=We wait. For nightfall. For the hour of her domain.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_narration=The setting sun slips behind the mountains and night blankets the countryside in deep purples and blues. The stars begin to come out, tiny silver pinpoints in the darkening sky.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_narration=Slowly, the pool begins to glow!
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_snark=All right, I must admit... that's pretty spectacular.
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_healer=Now what?
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_bookish=Now one of us goes in! There's enough power to grant one of us something special.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_bookish=This will be one for the books! I'm going in!
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_snark=I'll do it. I could use a little more sparkle in my life.
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_healer=I will take on this burden, so that others might not suffer if things go poorly.
~05~choice_four~panel_001~1_snark=Maybe this isn't such a good idea after all...
~06~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_npc=Well, here goes!
~06~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_npc=Hmm, I don't think anyth—
~07~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_npc2=I don't feel ridiculous at all ...
~07~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_npc2=Well this was anticlima—
~07~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_snark=Well I'll be...
~08~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_npc3=Maybe these waters have healing properties. I wonder if I could bottle it up.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_npc3=Or... it could just be pond wa—
~08~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_healer=Whoa. You can't bottle that!
~09~player_chose_four~panel_001~1_snark=It's cold and that water looks colder. Let's get out of here.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_002~1_snark=Come on, <bookish>. It's a sparkly puddle and nothing else.
