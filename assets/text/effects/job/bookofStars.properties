~01~prompt~panel_001~1_speech=We found this book full of constellations and strange writing!
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_bookish=Someone needs to dedicate some time to focus on translating the Book of Stars.
~03~~panel_001~1_participant=Long days and nights pass as <participant> combs through the library. <participant.mf:He pores/She pores/They pore> over ancient tomes, their pages crumbling with age and ink faded with time. Unfurls scrolls that crackle and split, no matter how carefully they are unrolled.
~03~~panel_002~1_participant=At long last, the code is unraveled! The cryptic lines revealed!
~03~~panel_003~1_participant=This is it!
~03~~panel_004~1_thought=Ah hah! <participant.bookish/snark/coward/60:I knew it! I knew I'd seen these symbols before! /I found it! FINALLY. I thought I'd be looking forEVER./I found it! I was worried I'd never figure this out!/This is it! I've found it!>
~03~~panel_005~1_goofball=Did you say something?
~03~~panel_005~2_narration=At the next desk over, <goofball> shakes <goofball.mf:himself/herself/themself> awake and lifts <goofball.mf:his/her/their> head.
~03~~panel_006~1_participant=<participant.bookish/snark/coward/60:I found it! I knew I'd seen these symbols in a book we have here!/I found it! I was just about to give up, too./I found it! I almost thought I'd have to throw in the towel./Yes! I found what I'd been looking for!>
~03~~panel_007~1_participant=<participant.bookish.50/snark:It was obviously in Aestrea's Esoterica Arcana Volume 23a./Now that I found it, I can't believe I didn't look in this book first! It's obviously the right one!>
~03~~panel_007~2_goofball=Obviously...
~03~~panel_008~1_goofball=So you know what it means now?
~03~~panel_009~1_participant=<participant.snark/bookish.50:Oh no! Not in the slightest. Now comes the fun part! Translating it line by line!/Not at all, but I'm close! Now comes the fun part! Translating it line by line and cross referencing these other books! >
~03~~panel_010~1_participant=Yeah, this might take awhile ...
~03~~panel_010~2_goofball=We have very different ideas of fun. I'm going to go see what the others are up to. Good luck with your star stuff and scribbles.
~03~~panel_011~1_narration=Today.
~03~~panel_011~2_participant=Glimmering pot ... no, glimmering [b]pool[]. "Into the glimmering pool!" That's... it!
~03~~panel_012~1_participant=It's done! And ... it seems to be a map to a place called the Glimmering Pool.
