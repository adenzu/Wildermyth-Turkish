~01~~panel_001~1_narration=In the beginning of time, the world floated as a seed.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The seed was small and fragile,
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=so the waters carried it gently in its currents.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=The seed was of itself for many ages, until one day its shell began to split.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=From its fissures spread long, reaching threads
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=that longed for something to hold.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=The waters softly carried the seed down
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=down
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=down
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=There the waters placed the seed in the sand, and it began to grow.
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=into the deepest depths of its belly.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=The threads spun into the sand and spoke to the seed of their findings, so as it began to sprout, it knew what it must become.
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=From the seed came the world, so large that it now cradled the waters that once cradled it.
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=From its bursting also came creatures,
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=things of simple minds that wandered and worshiped the waters.
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=But these creatures knew not rule nor law, neither culture nor song, so the waters spoke to the world.
~01~~panel_016~1_narration=They pulled from the sands in the waters’ belly,
~01~~panel_017~1_narration=drew air from the world’s breath,
~01~~panel_018~1_narration=and together created the first Avusce.
~01~~panel_019~1_narration=The Avusce were the favorite children of the waters and world.
~01~~panel_019~2_narration=And from the waters and worlds, were given gifts.
~01~~panel_020~1_narration=The world pulled its threads from the sands and strung them between each Avusce that they might speak together.
~01~~panel_020~2_narration=Through the threads, the Avusce were intertwined with one another and the very world itself.
~01~~panel_021~1_narration=From the waters, the Avusce were given life everlasting.
~01~~panel_021~2_narration=So long as the waters flowed, so too would the Avusce.
~01~~panel_022~1_narration=Finally, the waters raised land along its back so the Avusce might watch above the other creatures, shepherding all things as they should be.
~01~~panel_022~2_narration=And so this is how things came to be as they are, perfect and complete the way they were envisioned.
