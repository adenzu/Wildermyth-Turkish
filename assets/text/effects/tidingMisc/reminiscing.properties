~01~~panel_001~1_narration=<hero> and <friend> enjoyed talking about the old days over a campfire. <hero> <hero.leader/hothead/poet/healer:would scratch tactical maps in the dirt, mulling over how they could have approached certain battles more effectively./would always exaggerate how many monsters <hero.mf:he/she/they> had slain at each battle, but <friend> didn't feel the need to correct <hero.mf:him/her/them>./would sometimes try to capture their reminiscence in verse, but had trouble coming up with rhymes for "Thrixl."/would pause sometimes and ask <friend> if they had done the best they could. <friend> always assured <hero.mf:him/her/them> that they had.>
