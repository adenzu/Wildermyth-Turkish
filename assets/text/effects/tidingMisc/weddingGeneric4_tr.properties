~01~~panel_001~1_narration=<hook> ve <hook2>'nin düğünü nehir geleneğini takip etti. Eski hayatlarının tüm dertlerini temsil etmek için boyalı taşları bir tekneye yerleştirdiler. Sonra, tekneyi aşağı doğru gönderdiler.
~01~~panel_002~1_hook2=Translation error: <hook.personality:<hook2.bookish/poet/60:[face:interested]Mm, yes, I'd read that. I'm happy we're here to take part in it. Happy it's you and me./[face:interested]I feel it. Standing where generations of lovers have stood. It's [i]around[] us. [i]In[] us./[face:happy]Didn't know that, no. Was just thinking how I'd love to dunk you in the water and hear you holler.>/<hook2.hothead/snark/60:[face:angry]Doubts? By all bones below us, how can you still ask me that? I'd [i]die[] for you./[face:dubious]You know, I [i]wasn't[]. You do have a unique way of conjuring them, though./[face:happy]No. No doubts. We're two stones come to rest. Sinking in, sharing moss.>/<hook2.greedy/loner/romantic/60:[face:skeptical]Anticipating pie, actually. How long do we have to stand here to be [i]Romantic[]?/[face:interested]How'd you know? We could just sit and fish here, couldn't we?/[face:sad]Oh, just shut up and [i]feel[] this with me. This is the most beautiful moment of our lives!/[face:joy]Just watching our boat. They say if it gets caught or capsizes, we're looking at an early split!>/<hook2.coward/greedy/romantic/60:[face:joy]I'm okay with it. [i]I'm[] certainly not climbing in a boat anytime soon!/[face:interested]I'd say you're awful, but... it's kind of a shame, isn't it? Maybe we should fetch it later, when no one's watching?/[face:sad]Don't ruin the moment! /[face:joy][i]That's[] what you want to say \nto me right now?>/<hook2.bookish/loner/snark/60:Oh, certainly.[face:interested] It's an effective one, though. I'm happy to learn what [i]our[] purpose will be./Part of me doesn't know... why I've held on so long to the things that hurt me./[face:skeptical]Wait, that whole thing was meant to be [i]serious[]? I just painted goofy faces on mine./[face:happy]I know. Thank you. I [i]do[] feel \nlighter though. Somehow.>/<hook2.coward/goofball/60:[face:talking]You [i]know[] that's not funny. Now I'm nervous just standing here!/[face:joke]Oh, excellent! Then we show up to our own feast, dripping and naked, squirming up onto the riverbank like frogbeasts!/[face:happy]How about we come back after the feast? I'm sure I'll have to wash whatever you eat [i]off[] you.>/<hook2.loner/poet/snark/60:[face:interested]I feel... surprisingly weightless. Happy. Thank you./[face:talking]I feel like we could turn into trees, on this bank. I'd grow happily with you. Forever./[face:joke]Yeah, I would've preferred a ceremony where I got to tease you about all your past mistakes. But this was fine./[face:talking]I'm ready for it. But I'd take you anyway. And whatever comes with you.>/<hook2.greedy/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:dubious]It's a nice spot, love. Just remember, I'd like to [i]dance[] with you, sometimes. [i]Inside[]. Where there's other [i]people[]./[face:interested]Mm. Maybe we should just stay here a while?/[face:joy]You're so perfect, <hook>. Please just know that. That this is [i]everything[] I ever wanted./[face:dubious]Hmm. I suddenly feel... Your gift for flattery may have a profound [i]effect[] on our marriage./[face:happy]Right? I want to tell you... please don't think that I ever need more than this. Just you and me. Anywhere we are.>/<hook2.bookish/greedy/goofball/hothead/snark/60:[face:interested]Oh, it's a thousand things. This old custom, the weight of a worry and ballast of a stone. My thudding heart. And kissing you. And.../[face:skeptical]Not thinking about anything important, really. Well, dinner, for starters. And then... whatever we want after./[face:joy]I see the reflection of a beautiful <hook.mf:man/woman/person>. Too good for me, but standing at my side anyway. Guess I've done a few things right./[face:happy]Nothing. Not a single wagging thing. Just happy.../[face:skeptical]What do I see? Some fish. Weeds. Water bugs. An old glinting hook's in there too, see it? Half-sucked into the silt./[face:happy]Looking at the bredth of our lives together, all stretched before us. It's a boundless green horizon.>/<hook2.bookish/coward/hothead/loner/60:[face:skeptical]Buoyancy is a fickle thing, of course, and then there's rapids a little ways along. But if you'd risk it with me.../[face:interested]Oh, I... well, if it was with you, I'd do it, of course. But... our feast. You've been talking about it for weeks.../[face:joke]I'd do it, you know? You shouldn't joke, 'cause I [i]would[]. But no, let's get drunk and rowdy before we sneak away.../[face:happy]It's tempting. But no, love, I know you're looking forward to tonight. I am too. Let's enjoy this. [i]With[] our friends./[face:happy]Float away together? We could. But we'd be missing a wonderful dinner.>/<hook2.coward/loner/60:[face:interested]Oh! No! Just worried I didn't put all my worries in. There's probably a few more stones I could scribble on. You good at rock-throws?/[face:joy]How do you always [i]know[]? I'm sorry. No, not really, it's just... You ready for this feast?/[face:joy]Never without [i]you[]. But together...? Maybe we [i]should[] make our getaway, while everyone's distracted with food.>> --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters

~01~~panel_002~3_hook=<hook.personality:[face:talking]Bu gelenek [i]burada[] doğdu, biliyor musun? <town>da./[face:interested]Şüphelerin yok, değil mi?/[face:happy]Seçiminden pişman mısın, yoksa sadece oltanı unuttuğun için mi?/[face:skeptical]Mükemmel bir tekneyi geri gönderme konusunda [i]sen[] ne hissediyorsun?/Sorun değil. [i]Tüm[] eski endişelerinin öylece kaybolup gitmeyeceğini biliyorum. Bu bir sembol./[face:joke]Şu anda yüzmeye gitmek istiyorum. Ya sen?/İstediğim buydu. Geçmişi bırakıp birlikte ilerlemek./[face:interested]Bunun hiç umurumda değil./Nehirde düşünmek mi, yoksa gördüğün başka bir şey mi var?/[face:happy]Biliyor musun, ikimiz de o tekneye binebiliriz. Her şeyi... bırakabiliriz./[face:joke]Kendin yüzerek uzaklaşıp uzaklaşmamayı mı tartıyorsun?>
