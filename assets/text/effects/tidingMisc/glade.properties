~01~~panel_002~2_narration=<hero.personality2:Under swaying boughs <hero.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> pass an afternoon in the pages of an old book, until fading light brought <hero.mf:him/her/them> to <hero.mf:his/her/their> feet again, and set <hero.mf:him/her/them> back on the road home./Where the applefern bloomed, <hero.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> rest <hero.mf:his/her/their> feet while a thrush's song tickled <hero.mf:his/her/their> ears. In those moments, all <hero.mf:his/her/their> unpleasant memories of strife and struggle faded away./[face:happy]<hero.mf:He/She/They>'d rest wherever <hero.mf:his/her/their> feet stopped, distracted by the antics of scuttling mice and warbling toadsong. <hero.mf:He'd/She'd/They'd> always return with a smile on <hero.mf:his/her/their> face./With a sunny glade all to <hero.mf:himself, he/herself, she/themself, they>'d forget <hero.mf:his/her/their> toils and responsibilities for an afternoon, free to imagine the world as <hero.mf:he/she/they> liked it./<hero.mf:He/She/They>'d nap sometimes, beneath the net of swaying boughs, and awake with a smile on <hero.mf:his/her/their> face, ready for the journey home./<hero.mf:He/She/They> wandered without direction, rested wherever <hero.mf:his/her/their> feet stopped, and chewed on breadcrusts when <hero.mf:he/she/they> got hungry. It was a simple and satisfying life./In one particular glade <hero.mf:he/she/they>'d pause, put up <hero.mf:his/her/their> feet, and watch the hummingbirds dance from tree to tree. <hero.mf:He/She/They> always returned home with a smile on <hero.mf:his/her/their> face.//In a sunny glade on a spring morning, the silence broken only by the rustle of new leaves or the timid song of a woodhop, <hero.mf:he/she/they> felt the meaning of peace in <hero.mf:his/her/their> very bones./<hero.mf:He/She/They>'d rest in sun dappled glades and on grassy knolls, places where the heroes in old stories were apt to have fateful encounters. But <hero.mf:he/she/they> never met anyone <hero.mf:himself/herself/themself>./<hero.mf:He/She/They>'d put up <hero.mf:his/her/their> feet in a grassy glade, where <hero.mf:his/her/their> only company were the warty toads and the bristly woodhops. <hero.mf:He/She/They> liked it better that way.>
