Devoid of thought or deep consideration, it seemed./a strange look. Courage was there, it seemed. In <hero2.mf:his/her/their> eyes. Real courage./a rare, bare, mirthless look. As if, for a moment, <hero2.mf:his/her/their> heart had hollowed./a long grim gaze. [b]Care[] was in that look. And feeling. A deep-buried sadness, the revelation of which felt somehow generous./the gaze of a <hero2.mf:man/woman/human> who's spent. Whose cares have rolled <hero2.mf:him/her/them> up./a slow and joyless look. Devoid of energy, absent any kind of animation./a strange scowl. Directionless, it seemed. Like someone who's suddenly woken, not knowing where they are./a bare-eyed look. Not reluctant at all, it seemed, to share what was behind it. It was sad, it was sudden./an inelegant scowl. No deep meaning there. Almost... a lostness in <hero2.mf:his/her/their> eyes./the most unusual look... of hollowness. Or was it remorse? Or was it just weariness?/a rare, undisguised look. Somber, unworried about its bareness.>
