.name=Tidings
~01~~panel_001~1_narration=One <random:gold verdant morning/cotton-aired morning/breezy bright morning/crisp morning/sun-dappled morning>, <hook> and <hook2> were married. Folks of <town> gathered a few miles from the road and hung paper scarves on the Weddingtree the couple chose.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=An all-day feast would follow.
~01~~panel_001~3_hook=<hook.personality:[face:happy]I never know what you're thinking. You know that? You'll always intrigue me./[face:interested]Do you think we chose... I mean, will it stand a long time?/[face:joy]Already thinking about chopping it down? You can still escape, you know.../[face:joy]Funny at weddings. I just can't wait for the [i]food[]./How're you doing, <hook2>? People seem happy./[face:joy]Come on, then. I want to drink and eat with my [i]<hook2.mf:husband/wife/spouse>[]!/Good place, isn't it? We do well together, love./[face:interested]All these people... care? I'd just as soon... with you.../[face:talking]We're birds, my love. The wind of this day will carry us forever skyward./Since I was a <hook.mf:boy/girl/child> I dreamed of today. Our tree.../[face:skeptical]It's just a tree, remember that. If it gets lightning-struck, or cut, we...>
~01~~panel_001~4_hook2=<hook.personality:<hook2.goofball/poet/60:[face:joy]Nothing exceptional, I promise! Trying to come up with a way to make you laugh./Thinking how fortunate we are. To marry on a day blessed with memorable weather. And our Weddingtree so regal./Thinking of... the time we slept out there. And maybe tonight... sneaking out early.>/<hook2.bookish/coward/leader/60:[face:interested]The probability of us outliving our Weddingtree is extremely miniscule, love. Not that... well, sorry. I meant that to sound more positive./[face:interested]I [i]know[]! If it does fall, then I guess... Well, should we brace it up?/Don't worry, <hook>. Nothing short of death will change my heart./[face:happy]You and your worries. Naw. It'll be okay. Trees do much better than people, on their own.>/<hook2.hothead/snark/60:[face:dubious]You're awful. I'll tackle anyone who comes [i]near[] our tree. Including you./[face:joke]Not yet. Let's wait and see how we both age./My heart is so full right now, I can't even laugh. I think I'd start crying.>/<hook2.healer/romantic/60:Yes, yes. We'll get you fed. Thanks for doing this with me./[face:sad]How did I fall for someone so... I mean, what about this [i]moment[], love!? Urg./Ridiculous. But yeah, I guess I wouldn't mind starting early...>/<hook2.greedy/leader/loner/60:[face:joke]I'm just hungry. Why're they all [i]dawdling[]?/You touched a lot of their lives, <hook>. You should be proud. I know [i]I[] am./[face:interested]They do, don't they? Don't know why. It's [i]our[] wedding./They say it can be the happiest day of our lives. And while it's great... I'm sure we'll top it, somehow.>/<hook2.coward/goofball/poet/60:[face:interested]Mm. What a word that is to hear. <hook>'s <hook2.mf:[i]husband[]/[i]wife[]/actual [i]spouse[]>? You're... sure?/[face:joke]One thing at a time, dear. I want to tease my <hook.mf:husband/wife/spouse> first!/[face:joy]Now, love. What do I tell you about impatience and missed [i]opportunity[]...?/Sure, sure. Just let me have another look. The sun'll go down before we know it...>/<hook2.bookish/greedy/hothead/loner/60:Traditions [i]mean[] something. The significance of a book's wobblyworn spine. Anyway... [i]Thank you[]./[face:happy]Nice. And you [i]have[] to take my side now. No exceptions! Come on, let's sneak some early drinks.../[face:angry]Well, of course, but... They're stepping on the roots. They're stepping on our [i]tree[]!/Wouldn't have thought it, from the... well, remember the first time we met? How different, now. How I love you.../[face:joy]You'd work well with anyone. [i]I'm[] just the clever <hook2.mf:fox/vixen/fox> who bit you quickest!>/<hook2.greedy/leader/loner/romantic/snark/60:Some of them just care about the food. But... yeah. A lot of folks [i]do[] admire you. Well, and me, of course!/I know. [i]I[] would've been happy with just us. But now you see how many people love you./Eh, they want the drinks, probably. But it's all part of the thing. The memory./[face:happy]Oh, darling, wherever you go, you're admired. You're [i]everyone's[] favorite. Except... well, [i]I[] get to be yours!/Eh, they want the drinks, probably. But it's all part of the thing. The memory./Traditions will bring out the best in folks, sometimes. The good traditions. I like this one.>/<hook2.bookish/goofball/poet/romantic/60:[face:talking]If we [i]are[] birds, then let's remember: the lift doesn't last if one neglects to beat one's wings./[face:joy][i]That's[] the kind of thing my [i]<hook.mf:husband/wife/spouse>[] says...! Who cares what else life throws at me!/[i]"<hook2.mf:His/Her/Their> lonesome lips sang: all winged things in time shall nest, from blackbirds, to dragons, to the heart in my breast."[]/When you talk like that, I can't help it. There was never a love like [i]this[] one./Oh dear, we're birds again? Let's flit to a more private tree. Before we're needed at the table.>/<hook2.greedy/loner/60:I always painted a much grander picture in [i]my[] mind. [face:joy]But to wed you? A big meal and a pretty tree are more than enough!/[face:happy]It's more than I would've imagined alone... But that's part of why I love you, I guess./Me too. But I'm so glad it's you, <hook>. None of it would feel right, without you.>/<hook2.poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:dubious]I'll never convince you about these things, will I? Ah well. Sure, it's just a tree to you. But I'll keep it in my heart./[face:dubious]Oh, shut up. It's not [i]just[] anything. If our Weddingtree dies, I'll... well. Anyway, let me enjoy this./[face:angry][i]You're[] the one who had to have it! I wanted a wedding [i]bear[]. Would've loved to see them try hanging paper on [i]that[]!/It's a tradition, you know? It's our [i]Weddingtree[]. It'll mean something to [i]me[], and I suspect you'll be fond of it in twenty years.>>
