.longName=Woodland Wedding
.name=Tidings
~01~~panel_001~1_narration=<hook2> and <hook> took their vows <random:at eveningtide, last day of a prosperous year/in the ancestral glade near <town>/amid night woods, before an ancestral lamp/at the shrine of <hook2>'s ancestors>.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=<hook2.personality:<hook2> fumbled <hook2.mf:his/her/their> words, dazed by <hook>'s beauty, surrendering to the mysterious joys of loving another./<hook2> found <hook2.mf:himself/herself/themself> uncustomarily calm throughout. Stilled and warm of heart. <hook2.mf:He/She/They> helped <hook> through./<hook2> grinned through half of it, then wept through the other. Crowds of starlings laughed overhead./Yes, <hook2> insisted. Didn't want to risk ruin, ignoring observances of respected traditions./It meant the world to <hook2>. All the more because it had been <hook> who insisted./<hook2>'s solemn smile spoke of an oft-unsettled heart, brought peace./It was the rare time <hook2>'s emotions got the best of <hook2.mf:him/her/them>. Spoke <hook2.mf:his/her/their> troths through tears./A shy <hook2.mf:boyish/girlish/childish> smile replaced <hook2>'s normally stoic face, and <hook> knew <hook.mf:he/she/they>'d done right./<hook2> felt a wild flush of love here in the gaze of <hook2.mf:his/her/their> forebearers, hallowed air all aglow./The air by the stump hung warm and fragrant, their breaths entwined. <hook2>'s smile glowed./It was one of the few things <hook2> insisted on, one of <hook2.mf:his/her/their> only cherished wishes.>

~01~~panel_002~2_narration=The long looked-for wedding would be a happy memory for the rest of their lives.
