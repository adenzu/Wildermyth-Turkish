A feast followed./From the colorful ceremony to the indulgent feast, all was as <hook2> had dreamed./A bright ceremony and a merry feast brought everyone out to celebrate./A big meal brought the familiar and the hungry out of their homes./They held a brief ceremony and a very long feast./A feast and a flock of stories followed their sweet ceremony.>
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=The people of <town> <hook.coward/greedy/healer/leader/loner/romantic/60:enjoyed seeing the normally timid <hook> so wild, so comfortable and lively./were startled but pleased at the generosity <hook> displayed that night./were happy to see <hook>, who'd helped so many, finding joy for <hook.mf:himself/herself/themself>./congratulated <hook> and warmly sang <hook.mf:his/her/their> praises./were surprised to see <hook> so joyous and free./were a little sad to see charming <hook> paired off./were happy to bang mugs together for <hook>, a hero to many.> <hook2> would always remember <hook2.personality:the moment. Like a scene brought to life from history, from legend: <hook2.mf:he and <hook>/she and <hook>/them two together>, indelibly written into the world's pages./the courage <hook2.mf:he/she/they> felt that night, looking forward to a long pleasant life./the laughter and tenderness of that night, and the glow of love that lit <hook>'s face./the effort and expense of throwing such a lavish party... and how [ni]worthwhile[] it was, in the end./the faces gathered round, the weight of a community's favor poured behind their love./the rowdy songs and sloppy toasts, the brazen cheer when dawn rose on them all still dancing./how they got there, why the night was possible, and why it meant so much. It drove <hook2.mf:him/her/them> on./the weird smile that kept climbing <hook2.mf:his/her/their> cheeks. Irrepressible, somehow. After a while <hook2.mf:he/she/they> just let it stay there./the starlight twinned in their earthbound lanterns, the hum in <hook>'s chest... the glory a moment like that can contain./<hook>'s eyes full of lanternlight, and later, moon. All <hook2.mf:he/she/they> wanted was in <hook>./the pitiful attempts <hook2.mf:he/she/they> made at speaking. Tears would spring from nowhere. How sad. How wonderful.>
