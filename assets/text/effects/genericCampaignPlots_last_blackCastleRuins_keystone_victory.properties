~01~~panel_001~1_narration=Not long after the last <threat.singular> falls, the surrounding bogland begins to fog fully over.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=There's no sensation to this fog at all. No dampness, \nno aroma, no weight on <hero2.exists:their/<hero>'s> eyelashes.
~01~~panel_002~5_hero=[small]<hero2.exists:<hero.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:Don't leave me here. <hero3.exists:<hero3>? /><hero2>?/Mistdance?/<hero3.exists:You two aren't abandoning me, are you?/You're not abandoning me, are you?>/Well this's dumb and ridiculous./Should I do something?/Well. Fogmagic again. What's there to do?/<hero3.exists:<hero4.exists:Everyone alright?/You both alright?>/You alright, <hero2>?> Shout if you're struggling.>/This's... wonderful.>
~01~~panel_002~6_hero3=<hero3.exists:[small]I'm just standing here./>
~01~~panel_002~7_hero2=<hero2.exists:[small]Best not to move, probably./>
~01~~panel_003~5_narration=Quick as it settled, it clears, moved by no wind.
~01~~panel_003~6_hero=<hero.goofball.80:[face:happy]/>
~01~~panel_004~6_npc=Thank you<hero2.exists:<hero3.exists:<hero4.exists: all/ three>/ two>/, friend>. Afraid I got chased here, and could not think what to do. \nI am no fighter. I only just managed to get that Landlosing spell in the air.
~01~~panel_004~7_hero=<hero.genericPlots_blackCastleHero1:You had me wondering, there./Who...? Ah. You're the sage. <npc>. Right?>
~01~~panel_005~8_npc=<hero.genericPlots_blackCastleHero1:<hero2.exists:<hero>. I am happy I saw the wisdom in trusting you. I bring dire tidings, but am met with valor-flushed faces./<deadHero.exists:I am sorry for the grim toll this task has already taken on you. Now I must put in front of you a still more dangerous path./I did hope you would bring help, <hero>. But I suppose you have proven yourself formidable, and you are here because you are most suited to the task. Very well.>>/<hero2.exists:You were sent to help? I am glad. There is time, but not a lot of it./<deadHero.exists:I am sorry for the grim toll this task has already taken on you. Now I must put in front of you a still more dangerous path./I will admit, I expected... more help than just [i]one <hero.mf:man/woman/person>.[] But you are clearly skilled. I will give you what I know.>>>

~01~~panel_006~5_narration=<hero2.exists:/<deadHero.exists:<hero>'s unable to think \nof much congenial to say./Though the swamp was an illusion, the <threat.singular> corpses are very real.>>

~01~~panel_006~9_hero4=<hero4.exists:[small]Everyone there?[]/>
~01~~panel_007~1_speech=[light]I went and I saw the Black Castle for myself.
~01~~panel_007~2_speech=[light]A ruin, and it clearly [i]had been[] a ruin for many an age. But I met, there, the Castle's keeper. And from her, I learned the lost half of the legend.
~01~~panel_008~1_speech=[light]<npc2.mf:King/Queen/the Monarch> <npc2>'s weakness was truthlessness in love. And <npc2.mf:he was/she was/they were> cursed, one time, by a wroth enchanter whom <npc2.mf:he had/she had/they had> mistreated. Rather than live among <npc2.mf:his/her/their> people and spill <npc2.mf:his/her/their> misfortune on them, <npc2.mf:he/she/they> left the Black Castle. And none there saw <npc2.mf:him/her/them> again.
~01~~panel_008~2_speech=[light]The castle raised good governors for a time. But it could not survive without the Sorceress. Corrupt hands pulled it stone from stone. Folks dispersed. And it became a lonesome place.
~01~~panel_009~1_speech=[light]And then... apparently about a normal <npc.mf:man/woman/person>'s lifetime ago... it was found.
~01~~panel_009~2_speech=[light]<threat.cdgmt:Deepists under the mountain, among the oldest cracks and passages, crawled like sugarsmelling ants. Their own great Monarch followed, and mounted the vacant throne./A mighty creature discovered those black walls, crumbled though they were, and made the place its lair. Drauven, it gathered, and these Drauven united to be its army./Gorgons, it is said, [i]love[] such places. Still and quiet places. They search them out, even far from the sea. And they made there a claim, and would not be scared off it./Rich in old bones were the lands beneath those stones, and the Morthagi were likely drawn there for that reason. They stayed, and would not be scared out./[i]I[] do not pretend any great knowledge of Thrixl, nor any art at divining their purposes. But they came to those black stones and settled there, and were impossible to move. A Maylen came, one of particularly high form.>
~01~~panel_010~2_speech=[light]Ensconced there, the <threat.plural> began to work broadening and deepening evil, not only on humankind, but on the land and its elder denizens.
~01~~panel_011~11_npc=So the castle's keeper summoned up all her magic, and she brought the Castle back to the place she had once moved it from. In hopes it would give heroes like you a chance to fight back.
~01~~panel_011~12_hero3=<hero3.exists:[small]<hero3.bookish/coward/greedy/loner/snark/60:It's an [i]unprecedented[] magical occurrence.../Doesn't sound like a place I [i]want[] to go. But.../[face:dubious]A chance to save it's bacon, more like./[face:grim]Heroes is a word, I guess./[face:dubious]A chance to save its bacon, more like./Brave little spirit, huh?>/>
~01~~panel_011~13_hero=[small]<hero3.exists:<hero3.bookish/coward/greedy/loner/snark/60:Or maybe it happens all the time? Who knows?[face:skeptical]/Maybe it's got a nice gift-shop.[face:skeptical]/We [i]should[] eat at some point./It's definitely a word. There's letters in it, so you know.[face:skeptical]/We [i]should[] eat at some point./[face:skeptical]I guess. I wonder what danger a cute spirit dreads...>/<hero2.exists:<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]It [i]does[] only get more dangerous, doesn't it?/So... me and <hero2.pcfn.hero:<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>. Huh./my <hero2.mf:son/daughter/kid>. Hm./<hero2>. Hm./<hero2>. Hm.>>/<deadHero.exists:[small]I [i]shouldn't[] do this alone. I'll try to bring more. Hopefully... hopefully not just so we can die.[face:grim]/[face:grim][small]Heroes like me, huh?>>>
~01~~panel_012~11_npc=If you will go where I show you to go, you will find the Black Castle. And if you will trust your <hero2.exists:hands/hand>, I am sure you can uproot them, these <threat.plural>. You will perhaps have the aid of Chdaiahoon, the spirit who saved it once, and hopes to save it again. Will you do this for all of us?
~01~~panel_012~5_narration=<hero2.exists:They/<hero.mf:He/She/They>> will.
