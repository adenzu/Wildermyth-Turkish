~01~~panel_001~2_npc=Come along, stonefox. They'll eat up a fox for snacks.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Mountainwalkers aren't often free with their news.

~01~~panel_003~1_narration=So when one visits <town> to spread word of a massing threat, <hero> listens.
~01~~panel_003~2_npc=<foes.cdgmt:...almost military-looking, like a Drauven camp. It's weird for the bull-lovers to act that way./...keeping order and keeping themselves well-hid. Hitting homesteads, and foraging to feed themselves./...and their beasts beside them, all blathering and burning-eyed./...and you've never seen so much bone and brasswork before. Blech./...and they're never supposed to swarm like flies, I'd heard. But that's what seeing them reminded me of.>
~01~~panel_004~2_npc=Me and stonefox showed them our tails, didn't we? Anyway... came here because... it's territories at the limits of my ranges, but it's obvious to me where the land would lead them.
~01~~panel_005~2_npc=There's a wall, there. I'm no tactician. But there's a wall as old as trees that still stands solid. I think [i]that's[] where you bravefolk need to get to. If you hope to turn this army of <foes.plural> back.
~01~~panel_006~2_npc=Me, I'm headed again to the highlands tomorrow. I can put my notion of where it is on your map, though.

Don't you think it's better to just build up defenses at our towns, the places we look after?/<hero>, love? Don't you think it's better to just build up defenses at our towns, the places we look after? We run the risk of leaving them open to attack./I don't really get it. Our towns, the places we look after... shouldn't our defenses be [i]there?[]>>
~01~~panel_007~3_hero=<hero2.bookish/poet/romantic/60:<hero2.childOf.hero:You used to read my copy of the [i]Thnarric Elegia.[] Far too late into the night, as I recall./[i]You've[] read the [i]Thnarric Elegia.[]>/<hero2.childOf.hero:You used to quote the [i]Thnarric Elegia[] over breakfast./[i]You've[] read the [i]Thnarric Elegia.[]>/<hero2.childOf.hero:You used to ask me to read you the hero-parts of the [i]Thnarric Elegia,[] before bed.

~01~~panel_008~4_hero2=<hero2.bookish/poet/romantic/60:Oh, but that... would mean we're talking about the Templecity Wall. Where the Poet <npc2.mf:King/Queen/Monarch> <npc2> fell? Is that...? But that's... people only guess about where it used to stand...[face:interested]/Oh, but that... would mean we're talking about the Templecity Wall.

~01~~panel_009~2_narration=They see the old mountainwalker off, getting as much instruction from <npc.mf:him/her/them> as they can.
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=[white]If they don't reach the Ancient Wall before their enemies do, the <foes.plural> will overwhelm them, and wash this Yondering away.
~01~~panel_010~3_narration=[white]And then it's a race.
