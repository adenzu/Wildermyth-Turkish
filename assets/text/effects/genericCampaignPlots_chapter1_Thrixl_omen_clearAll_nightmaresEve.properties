~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=It was a night frothing cups battered tavern tables \nand bellowed tunes banged against the last <season-1> sky.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=Maybe all that joyous noise served to knock loose a star that'd chewed thin its thread.
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_hero2=<hero2.personality:Isn't it a relatively... [b]mundane[] pursuit? A romance, a marriage? Even just a shared house, I feel like would require more attention than I'd really prefer. But I guess... there [i]is[] a lot written about love. Its power to transform./[face:interested]What would it be like? To feel so secure in someone else you could marry them and not worry about all the possible ways it bends wrong?/[face:interested]How hard would it be? To cover them in bees? Have to find some bees first, I guess. How many bees stay up at night, is also a thing I wonder. /Flaunting their so-called happiness. As usual. [b]I[] certainly wouldn't trade places with them. I'll keep my shelfspace, thanks./[face:interested]There's something about these holiday romances... they can mean a lot of conflict or a lot of comfort... in the coming year./Not laughing at me, are they? What, did I sit in something?/[face:neutral]It'll always be this way, in <town>. Someday, I'll be elsewhere, and I'll see the turn of the <season>, and I'll remember. Maybe I'll have my own <hero2.awm:wife/husband>, then./What're they so happy about, anyway? Tomorrow, their heads will be full of wool and sand... they'll be sorry to see each other that way. I bet they will be./[face:neutral]I do wonder, sometimes, whether love might be the weapon of a weak and frightened god. Whose only wish is to distract us, and steal our lives while we dance, kiss, and dream./[face:happy]What a fevered feeling that must be. This heat in the air, and the shadow-tongued light, the thick waxy smells and sound of <hero2.awm:<npc.mf:<npc2.mf:a/her/a>/her/<npc2.mf:a/her/a>>/<npc.mf:his/<npc2.mf:his/a/a>/<npc2.mf:his/a/a>>> voice, suddenly soft... suddenly close.../[face:dubious]Laugh it up, loverabbits. You'll get sick of <npc2.mf:his/her/their> hair, and <npc2.mf:he'll/she'll/they'll> find your wit [b]challenging.[]>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=It swung its many-stranded tail across midnight.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_narration=A frayed star, falling wayward\nfrom some other firmament.
~01~prompt~panel_009~4_hero2=Wh...!? N... no. Hm?
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_hero=[gray][small]<hero.personality2:A rare and precious thing to witness./[face:interested]No way I imagined it, is there?/[face:happy]Maybe it means the end of the world. /[face:skeptical]Maybe it'll change my luck./No reason to overreact, I guess. \nOr upset anyone. Star might be a star./[][]A red one means violence.[face:talking] That feels clear enough./A warning to be indoors, if nothing else./No one knows it even fell, but me./Like the spark of a struck flint... it only hints \nat some deeper motion. Meaning./[face:interested]Maybe a carnal influence. A red star?\nWhy am [i]I[] by myself?/[face:dubious]Who do I think [i]I[] am, all the sudden?\nOmen-<hero.mf:Joe/Joan/Stone>, the Omen-picker?>
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_hero=<hero.personality:<hero3>? Pleased to see you devouring the [i]Mulldon[] book. But... it's a late hour to really... [i]digest,[] I guess I'll say, the allegory, and language, which, that's really the reason I lent it to you. So maybe.../[gray]Um, <hero3>? I'm at the window, don't be scared. But, uh... You're not up for any [i]particular[] reason, are you?/[face:happy][gray]<hero3.fullname>... Attend me, for [i]I[] am the voice of your conscience. It is time you wrapped the neighbor's house in timber-rope. That is the deed of a goodly soul, one who would see the whole town in stitches... And I mean, [i]laughing,[] not literal--/<hero3>. Hey, I'm coming in there. Could you get me some tea, or beer, or whatever'll wet a throat?/[gray]Hey, <hero3>? Sorry if I'm disturbing you. Everything alright? \nReading in that light'll give you a headache./[face:talking]Hey, <hero3>. Get out here and take a walk, you're up anyway./[face:neutral]<hero3>? Hope I'm not unwelcome, just was restless and saw your light on. Not the only thing I saw tonight, either./[face:neutral]You're awake, still./[face:talking]...and by the crouching candleflame, burnt low upon its trunk, <hero3> tortured <hero3.mf:his/her/their> poor diary, for thoughts <hero3.mf:he thought he'd/she thought she'd/they thought they'd> thunk./Shame finding you alone with a book on a night like this. Could've been up on the hill. A scarlet star went by, and I'm maybe the only one who saw it.[face:happy]/[face:dubious][gray]Psst. <hero3>. <hero3.fullname>. What's so interesting about the book? Don't tell me you've spent all night in here? On a warm <season>'s Eve?>
