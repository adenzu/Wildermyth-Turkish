~01~~panel_001~1_darken=[white]The bright and callow world gave birth to imaginative wonders.
~01~~panel_001~2_darken=[white]To horrors, also.
~01~~panel_002~1_darken=[white]We did not see the difference, when they were small.
~01~~panel_002~2_darken=[white]Both, we raised the same, until they grew, and revealed their natures. By that time, it was often late for our intervention.
~01~~panel_003~1_darken=[white]Some endure, of our dreams and nightmares.
~01~~panel_003~2_darken=[white]Those all must be our legacy. \nFor better, for worse, and forever.
~01~~panel_004~1_hero2=[white][action]Hrf!!
~01~~panel_004~2_action=[dark][actionLarge]cla-BANG!!
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=Tolling skulls and clanging metal: evening's rung in.\n<season> that year brings an eruption of Morthagi.
~01~~panel_005~2_action=...rattle...\n    [actionSmall]...plock...
~01~~panel_006~3_hero2=You good, <hero.pcfn.hero2:<hero.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>?/<hero.mf:son/daughter/child>?/<hero>?/<hero>?> That the whole batch?
~01~~panel_006~4_hero=[small]Yeah.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=Later.
~01~~panel_007~6_hero3=<hero3.pcfn.hero2:<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>!/<hero2>!/<hero2>!/<hero2>!> You left your typical mess. \n[small]Whew... My [i]feet[] aren't used to this anymore.
~01~~panel_007~7_hero=<hero.rfln.hero3:[face:dubious]Always on time for [i]dinner.[]/[face:talking]Quit hassling <hero.pcfn.hero2:my <hero2.mf:boy/girl/kid>,/my <hero2.mf:dad/mom/renny>,/<hero2>,/<hero2>,> I'm too tired to join in.[hero2.face:dubious]/[face:happy]You're late, love. But on time for [i]dinner,[] I see./Who's that? Oh, <hero.pcfn.hero3:that my <hero3.mf:boy/girl/kid>?/<hero3.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>?/<hero3>?/<hero3>?> Few days later than expected.>
~01~~panel_008~8_hero3=<hero.rfln.hero3:[face:skeptical][hero.face:skeptical]<hero.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/loner/poet/snark/80:See, other people think you sound smart. I just think you sound insecure./You don't look [i]hurt.[] What you [i]need[] me to watch you fight?/That's only when [i]you're[] there, hogface. Only way I get any./Aren't you supposed to be the nice one? Yeah, whatever./[face:dubious]How would [i]you[] know? I've never \neven seen you eat, practically./Aren't you supposed to eloquent? Circumspect? [i]At all[] likable?[face:dubious]/[face:talking]Everyone finds you funny. Keep doing it./[i]You[] can't even hold back from a hot pie, don't start.>/<hero3.loner/snark/60:[face:skeptical]/[face:joke]/[face:happy]>Oh, whoa! <hero.pcfn.hero2:[i]<hero.mf:Father/Mother/Ren-ren>[]/<hero>/<hero>/<hero>>, it's been a bit. Okay, no more hassling until I've at least eaten.<hero.loner/poet/snark/60:[hero.face:skeptical]/[hero.face:happy]/[hero.face:happy]/[hero.face:joy]>/What? It's priorities, these days. Getting fed. Getting back in fighting shape.[face:talking][hero.face:happy]/Like I said, it's been a couple years since I traveled this far.>
~01~~panel_009~8_hero3=Anyway, I got the location we needed. A place an original [i]Mortificer[] once lived, so they say. It's a rare, [i]old[] legend, but that just makes us more likely to find it. You know how we are.
~01~~panel_009~9_hero2=Mhmm.
~01~~panel_010~11_hero=<hero.rfln.hero3:[face:grim]/[face:neutral]/[small]Let's get you fed.[face:neutral]/>
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=There's always the hope that one of these times, they'll stumble upon a permanent answer to the Morthagi.
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=Perhaps it's this time, but no one expects it. Still, they'll make for the buried dwellingplace of a dusty rumor.
