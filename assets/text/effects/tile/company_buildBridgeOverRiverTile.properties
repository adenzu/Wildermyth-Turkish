This could be one of those...>/[face:skeptical]<leader.bookish/loner/greedy:I'm not sure it's smart to open another way to attack us.../Aren't we worried about what's on the other bank?/An escape route? Seems sensible to me.>/[face:joy]<leader.whm:Spend the <season> building a bridge? I smell a vicious waterfight.../Could do some river activities! Fishing, fiddle music, duck-racing...!/It'll be a good chance to test the pranking potential of my powers!>/[face:skeptical]<leader.poet/loner/romantic:I'm sure it would save us time in the long run. Time only grows more precious./Be helpful for traders, I'm sure. Perhaps we could charge a toll...?/Good use of the <season>. Helps the people travel, helps us, and I'm sure spurs a bit more growth around here.>/[face:happy]<leader.whm:Put this blocky frame of mine to good use, wouldn't it?/It's narrowest here. I think we should do it. Folk of <town> would thank us./Would help us understand the river, I think. Working so close to it.>/[face:joy]<leader.whm:Oho, I'll have this thing done in a week, I'd guess!/Couldn't say no to a bit of work by the waterside! Don't worry, enemy comes, I'll take them out myself./Rivers were meant to be crossed, weren't they? I'll get this thing done!>/<leader.coward/healer/romantic:[face:grim]Anyone can use a bridge. Our enemies included. Prudence is all I want.../[face:happy]It would help the folks of <town>, the wildfolk too. Heck, we'll use it often enough, I'm sure./A good bridge is defensible enough. If nothing else it'll be a solid chokepoint. I say we do it.>/[face:sad]<leader.goofball/healer/poet:[face:interested]If it's spacious enough underneath... Might be a nice <season> haunt for me./Let's think of the people on [i]both[] sides of the river. If they wanted neighbors, they'd have built a bridge themselves.../A bridge begs for traffic...>/[face:grim]<leader.bookish/goofball/leader:How many bridges have there been here and burned, I wonder? I'll ask in <town>, perhaps.../[face:skeptical]I've heard this river was beautiful. I'm just not big on riversmell, maybe./A river crossed can't be uncrossed. Though bridge may burn and trail be lost...>/[face:happy]<leader.whm:Think how I'll look, standing alone on a bridge as the sun falls, our foes rushing and my face grim.../Do you know that feeling of coming out of the hard wilderness, finding a well-made bridge overwater? /A bridge is a meeting spot, a joining spot. A place to make memories...>/[face:skeptical]<leader.goofball/greedy/leader:Well what do we need a bridge for? Oh... yeah. Crossing, I guess./[face:dubious]Don't we already do enough around here?/I suppose it's necessary. Shame there's not more productive people in <town>, though...>>
