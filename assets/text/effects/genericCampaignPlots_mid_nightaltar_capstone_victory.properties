~01~~panel_001~2_narration=The altar here is just a heap of dry wood, clinking crystal. The thick murk of night is suddenly parted by sun: like a swan splitting the water, it flashes white and arrests the eye.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=<hero2.exists:/<deadHero.exists:<hero> won't spend long wondering about the magic, here. There's <deadHero.2.exists:bodies of friends to see to./a friend to see to.>/<hero> will take a moment, there. Wondering what Warlock or Witch might've built this place. Hallowed it. And for what purpose, good or ill?>>
~01~~panel_002~3_hero=<hero.theme_star/hook_Darkheart:I'm... No, I'm pretty sure... I mean I don't think [i]at all[] that this was an evil place. It's an eye turned towards the astral shelf./It's gatemaking. Summoncraft.[face:talking] I... \ncan somehow speak to such matters./Nothing here was meant for evil. I feel sure of that. It's stuff of the elder witches, the warlocks, and hillmages.>

~01~~panel_004.(hero2_exists)~1_hero=<hero.theme_star/hook_Darkheart:Or it [i]was[][face:grim]. The problem with physical magic like this, earthbound magic... is that it can be reworked. It's a shame we didn't find it... before it was peeled of its purpose, and twisted like this./In antiquity, the human was a young beast, and needed the help of things beyond <hero.mf:him/her/them> to ascend. To learn and grow. To dominate nature, and to survive it./They worshipped things, our ancestors. They called on forces to whom we're now strangers. I don't know [i]enough[]. But I know these altars, shrines, hallows. They once had purposes, and places in daily life. It's a shame to see them twisted.>
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=<hero2.exists:They leave the wreckage there, all the runewood spoiled and the mystic rocks dispelled. Seasons will sort these things back into the ground.
