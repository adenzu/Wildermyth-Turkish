~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hunter=This is not good.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hunter=I've got to get <mystic>.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=“Getting” <mystic> was not so simple a task these days.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=<mystic.mf:He/She/They> had been noticing a "wrongness" in the world for weeks—<foes.cdgmt:cattle bellowing eerie songs, thumps and smoke from supposedly-empty caves/birds gathering in large, leering hordes. Rumbles and slashing noises in the night/the wildlife was twitchy and aggressive, the crops went blue-tinged and wilted/tools resisting their masters’ will, inhuman footsteps in the dark/an influx of sleepwalking, a subtle silken madness in the old>.
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_narration=And <mystic.mf:he/she/they> hadn’t been taking it well.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=<mystic.hothead/leader/bookish/goofball/coward/healer/snark/poet/loner/romantic/greedy:\nThe stonecutter told <mystic.mf:him/her/them> that if <mystic.mf:he/she/they> got in one more fight, <npc.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> run <mystic> out of town <npc.mf:himself/herself/themself>.\n/<mystic.mf:He'd/She'd/They'd> been snappish, ordering people around as if every task was a matter of life or death. People avoided <mystic.mf:him/her/them>, and <mystic.mf:he/she/they> soon did the same.\n/<mystic.mf:He/She/They> spent every waking moment combing through books with increasingly worrying titles.\n/<mystic.mf:His/Her/Their> evenings at the tavern had turned into longer and longer nights, and <mystic.mf:his/her/their> laughter had turned to wild-eyed ravings.\n/<mystic.mf:He'd/She'd/They'd> become all furrowed brows and shaking hands, and refused to leave the house some days for fear of something <mystic.mf:he/she/they> couldn't explain.\n/<mystic.mf:He'd/She'd/They'd> been checking on people obsessively, no matter their health, as if <mystic.mf:he/she/they> expected bad news. No reassurance could settle <mystic.mf:him/her/them>.\n/<mystic.mf:He/She/They> grew listless and dismissive. Almost as if the world had already ended, and <mystic> was annoyed to still be here.\n/Growing ever more inscrutable, <mystic> had begun to only speak in prophecies of some gloomy symbology.\n/Always somewhat removed, <mystic> had progressed to Downright Isolated.\n/<mystic.mf:He/She/They> became prone to fits of melodrama that even <mystic.mf:his/her/their> closest friends had trouble soothing.\n/<mystic.mf:His/Her/Their> cellar had been hastily packed with food and weapons, and still <mystic> crammed in more by the day.>

~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hunter=<hunter.goofball/snark/hothead/80:Yoo-hoo! <mystic>?/<mystic>! You think I just enjoy knocking?/<mystic>, don't make me kick in your door. It's a nice door./<mystic>, please. This is important.>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hunter=<hunter.goofball/snark/80:That omen stuff./That omen stuff./The omens.> You were right. Something in the woods is...
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_hunter=click
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hunter=...very strange.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_actionSmall=crrreakk
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hunter=I saw something out there today.
~01~prompt~panel_015.(foes_Deepists)~1_speech=An altar, but… evil. With horns and skulls and a blue fire that seemed to have a heartbeat of its own.
~01~prompt~panel_016.(foes_Drauven)~1_speech=It looked like a war banner, and there were bones, and….
~01~prompt~panel_017.(foes_Gorgons)~1_speech=An animal. Diseased, maybe? But this was twisting it, growing horrible… it wasn’t like anything I’d ever seen.
~01~prompt~panel_018.(foes_Morthagi)~1_speech=I could have sworn it was a giant metal spider, but it vanished into a cave before I could get a good look.
~01~prompt~panel_019.(foes_Thrixl)~1_speech=Like spider webs, but with… pictures woven in them. Of haunting things.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_hunter=<hunter.hothead/leader/bookish/goofball/coward/healer/snark/poet/loner/romantic/greedy:\nWhatever it was, it needs destroying.\n/Whatever this is, we can’t ignore it.\n/Whatever this is, it’s beyond hearsay and coincidence now.\n/It gave me some serious heebie-jeebies, not gonna lie.\n/It just about scared me out of my wits.\n/Our home is in danger, I just know it.\n/I didn’t freak out, though. You’d have been impressed.\n/Even more potent was the aura of dread surrounding it.\n/Not what one expects during a quiet stroll.\n/Something about it set my heart cold.\n/It’s a good thing someone of lesser bravery didn’t find it.\n>
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_mystic=<foes.cdgmt:Horns.../War banner.../Diseased.../Mechanical.../Webs...>? Hm.
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_hunter=I know you’ve been paying more attention than the rest of us.
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_hunter=And now, we need—
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_warrior=<hunter>! <mystic>! They're attacking <site>!
~01~prompt~panel_024~2_hunter=What?
~01~prompt~panel_025.(warrior_is_hothead_>_80)~1_warrior=Some sort of [i]<foes.cdgmt:horned cultists/army of lizard-people/mutated animals/metal skeletons/dragon-bugs>![]
~01~prompt~panel_026.(warrior_NOT_hothead)~1_warrior=Some sort of [i]<foes.cdgmt:horned cultists/army of lizard-people/mutated animals/metal skeletons/dragon-bugs>![]
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_warrior=<warrior.goofball/snark/bookish/60:\nWe gotta move it!\n/So enough chit chat, let’s go!\n/We stand a chance if we hurry!\n/Grab what you need and hurry!>
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_mystic=I knew it... and I didn't...
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_warrior=<mystic>, pull yourself together and come be useful for once.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=Rivalry
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_warrior=You can do this. We need your <mystic.hothead/greedy/bookish/loner/romantic/goofball/snark/leader/healer/poet/coward:strength/help/knowledge/help/support/help/cleverness/guidance/support/insight/help> now.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=Friendship
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_warrior=If not for the people there, then for [i]me.[] Come on.
~04~choice_three~panel_001~2_hunter=Romance
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_warrior=<warrior.hothead/snark/healer/greedy/bookish/romantic/poet/leader/loner/coward/goofball:Or do I have to drag you all the way to <site> myself?/Or don't. Whatever./Maybe try to salvage a fraction of your reputation?/Or don't. I'm sure I can handle it./The chance of you actively making things worse at this point is... minimal./Nobody swoons over a do-nothing. Remember that./Or tie yourself into a sad little knot and grow moss here for all I care./I won't say sitting here stewing [i]isn't[] an option, but it's a pretty appalling one at this point./Don't give me that look. I'm not [i]thrilled[] about this either./If [i]I[] can screw up the courage, there's no excuse for you./Or like... stare angrily at the monsters when they come knocking? Is that the plan?>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_warrior=So the good news is we've got three people now. The bad news is...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007.(foes_Deepists)~1_hunter=[gold]Snarrrll..
~05~player_chose_one~panel_008.(foes_Drauven)~1_hunter=[gold]Snarrrll..

~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_warrior=<warrior.hothead/snark/healer/greedy/bookish/romantic/poet/leader/loner/coward/goofball:Besides, when else do you get to snap clavicles and not get in trouble for it?/And if [i]I'm[] being sincere, you know it's a big deal./I've known you long enough to know that./What, you haven't always secretly dreamed of saving a town?... I thought everyone did./Our chances of success greatly increase with you there. By 50% at least, I'd wager./Just imagine all the starry-eyed <mystic.awm:ladies,lads> with the name "<mystic>" on their sighs./Find that spark. The one I've seen in you. And twist it into an unstoppable weapon./We can't let those beasts stomp all over everything we care about. Not without a fight./This is maybe one thing I don't want to do alone./You think I'm not scared? Of course I'm scared. But that's not the point./We'll risk our lives, maybe break some bones. Hopefully not our own. It'll be fun.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_hunter=...And then there were three.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_warrior=That's the good news. The bad news is...

~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~2_warrior=Never mind that. See the smoke up there?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005.(foes_Deepists)~1_hunter=[gold]Snarrrll..
