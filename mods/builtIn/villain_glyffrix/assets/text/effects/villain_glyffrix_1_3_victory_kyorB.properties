~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The killing blow comes through him clean.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Something like surprise rattles among the glimmering hard \nbodies of his underlings, who again abate their assault.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=They cluster about him, a wall of mouths, \nand eyes, and sworded limbs.
~01~~panel_004~15_hero=[i]Did[] we?
~01~~panel_004~16_npc=<hero4>, we... [small]we [i]won...[]
~01~~panel_004~17_hero4=Only for the moment.
~01~~panel_005~16_hero2=Whether we did or didn't, or for how long... \nnow<hero2.coward/goofball/healer/hothead/loner/romantic/snark/80:, we should, um. Probably... fall back?[face:interested]/ might be the time to jog off?[face:interested]/'s probably the time to fall back, hm?[face:interested]/'s a good time to get going. [face:skeptical]/'s probably the time to fall back./[face:interested] feels like the time to pull back?/'s a poor time to argue.[face:skeptical] Can we fall back?/ we have the chance, let's draw back.>
~01~~panel_005~18_hero3=Yep.
~01~~panel_006~14_hero4=Mm, smart. Perhaps we remove to the catacombs entrance? Fortify it?
~01~~panel_007~20_hero4=Here, let us be swift. <npc>? \nAnd leave the smiles behind.
~01~~panel_008~19_npc=But, Captain, we cannot \ncelebrate even a little...?
~01~~panel_009~18_hero3=I... sure. Go ahead with <hero>.
~01~~panel_009~21_hero4=[i]<hero2>,[] right? Can you bring up the rear? And be \n[i]wholly[] alert. I think I know the way best, so...
~01~~panel_010~22_npc=[small]Is my voice [i]entirely[] inaudible...?
~01~~panel_011~20_darken=[i]I[] hear you.
~01~~panel_013~20_darken=[i]No.[] Do not think [i]that.[] I am a friend.
~01~~panel_013~21_npc=Who are [i]you?[] A...
~01~~panel_014~20_darken=You do not even need to speak your heart. I [i]hear[] you.
~01~~panel_014~21_npc=[small]But that...
~01~~panel_016~20_darken=Be [i]happy,[] <npc>.
~01~~panel_016~21_darken=[i]Celebrate.
~01~~panel_016~22_npc=[small]I [i]am.[] Happy. I...
~01~~panel_017~21_npc=[small]But you. You are a voice.
~01~~panel_018~21_npc=[small]You are...?
~01~~panel_020~21_npc=[small][i]Hada?[] Greatfather? Hada?
~01~~panel_021~20_darken=Yes.
~01~~panel_021~21_npc=[small]You are [i]speaking to me?[]
~01~~panel_022~20_darken=Yes.
~01~~panel_022~21_npc=[small]Oh.
~01~~panel_023~20_darken=Do you not feel joy about this?
~01~~panel_023~21_npc=Yes. Right. I [i]should...[] I [i]must...[] [small]I [i]do.[]
~01~~panel_024~21_npc=I [i]do[] feel joy. I am [i]full[] of joy.
~01~~panel_025~20_darken=So come to me.
~01~~panel_025~21_npc=I am full of[i] joy![]
~01~~panel_026~20_darken=Yes. I am so close to you. Walk with me now.
~01~~panel_026~21_npc=May I?
~01~~panel_027~20_darken=Yes.
~01~~panel_027~21_npc=Yes.
~01~~panel_028~20_hero2=Stop. What's [i]wrong[] with <npc.mf:him/her/them>?
~01~~panel_028~21_hero4=[small]Hm?
~01~~panel_029~1_narration=In those days, the warning was oft-shared but not always remembered: \neven a moment's exultation may lead the wary mind beyond its own defenses.
~01~~panel_029~21_hero4=[small]What is...?
~01~~panel_030~1_narration=Devoid of its housing, still the will of the\nMaylen, Dunnaveer, exerts a terrible power...
~01~~panel_031~22_hero4=<npc>!!
~01~~panel_031~2_narration=...and so, like a night bird chasing starlight,  \nthe young <npc.mf:lord/lady/mystic> flits into darkness, lost.
~01~~panel_032~1_narration=Old Kyor fades with <npc.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~~panel_032~23_hero4=<npc>, stop, [i]control yourself,[] <npc>!!
~01~~panel_033~23_hero4=<npc>...! [small]<npc>... come b... ack.
~01~~panel_034~23_hero4=Come back.
~01~~panel_034~24_action=...[actionSmall]...
~01~~panel_035~23_hero4=That <npc.mf:boy/girl/child>... [small]never knew... how to...
~01~~panel_036~22_hero4=All [i]right,[] you say?
~01~~panel_036~23_hero2=Captain? It's alright.
~01~~panel_037~23_hero2=I know.
~01~~panel_037~24_hero4=All appears quite the opposite of right.
~01~~panel_038~17_hero2=Here, let's talk a bit.
~01~~panel_039~1_narration=Again, they find a fire to feed themselves by.
~01~~panel_039~2_narration=And spend their teethpicking time \npassing the needed tales round.
~01~~panel_040~3_hero2=So even when it's just the two of you... \nyou manage to bring that Thrixl down?
~01~~panel_040~5_hero4=[small]Mm.
~01~~panel_041~6_hero3=Each time like the last time.
~01~~panel_042~5_hero4=And each time <npc.mf:he is taken/she is taken/they are taken>.
~01~~panel_043~2_hero4=Enspelled. And led away from me. Beyond my reach, and I... [i]run.[] I end up running. After failing to protect <npc.mf:him/her/them>, I prove quite adept at saving my own life.
~01~~panel_044~5_hero2=It's sad.
~01~~panel_044~6_hero4=[small]Mm.
~01~~panel_044~7_hero3=It's hard.
~01~~panel_045~1_narration=Maybe the dark smells \n     a little like old morning frost.
~01~~panel_046~1_narration=<hero> remembers winter walks with <hero.mf:his/her/their> mother. The \npinecone path wobbling where <hero.mf:his/her/their> young eyes went.
~01~~panel_047~1_narration=And the next moment, though <hero.mf:he knows/she knows/they know> it's real,\nnone of it feels firmer than a favorite story.
~01~~panel_047~2_narration=Might it not be a dream? A dream escaping its cradle. Playing in the clothes of a memory.
~01~~panel_048~5_hero4=And so I suppose... I understand why you decided to go, and leave that all behind. I am ready to make the same decision.
~01~~panel_049~1_narration=Sleep proves a challenge for all of them.
~01~~panel_049~2_narration=A cold wind gnaws their noses.
~01~~panel_050~1_narration=But, waking, they troop off together.
~01~~panel_050~2_narration=Four strong.
~01~~panel_050~7_hero4=I want to ask [i]you,[] young <hero>...
~01~~panel_051~7_hero4=...about this road you are on.
~01~~panel_052~8_hero=[small]<hero.personality2:I imagined you might./[][face:interested]Hm?/[][face:talking]Do [i]you[] see a road?/[face:skeptical]Alright./Understandable./[][face:skeptical]What do you mean?/[]That's fine. Go ahead./Okay./[i]"The many roads we walk at once..."[face:talking]/[face:interested]My [i]road.[]/You [i]want[] to? Or you're asking [i]now?[]>
~01~~panel_053~9_hero4=I want to ask... how certain can anyone be of their own desires? And if they be certain, how well can such a person be trusted?
~01~~panel_054~10_hero=[small]Weird you say that.
~01~~panel_054~9_hero4=[i]"Certainty is the sister of insanity."[]\nSo the wisdom goes.
~01~~panel_055~11_hero=Weird, yeah, it's funny. The further we walk, the more sure... or <hero.bookish/poet/60:no, the more [i]stubborn[]/maybe more [i]stubborn[]/maybe just [i]stubborn-er[]> I become.
~01~~panel_056~11_hero=Do I [i]really[] need to find her? \nI don't know. Is the reason...?
~01~~panel_057~12_hero=A few days of journey. Of skewed words, and offsweet smiles.
~01~~panel_058~8_hero=<hero.goofball.80:Yeah, I know it's sort of a little [i]nuts,[] but.[face:happy]/<hero.bookish/coward/hothead/leader/poet/romantic/60:In truth, or at least in [i]brief...[] I am [i]not[] certain./What I mean is... I kind of don't believe it either?[face:interested]/You want the truth? [i]I'm[] a little frustrated by it.[face:skeptical]/I'm [i]not[] certain. Being fully honest./Honestly, [i]knowing[] seems impossible./It feels a little like I'm fooling [i]myself,[] but.[face:interested]/I kind of don't believe it either.>> But is there anything else to want? When I ask myself [i]that,[] it feels like... I don't know. The answer is: not really.
~01~~panel_059~11_hero=[small]I don't know... when I started \nfeeling [i]that way,[] though.
