~01~~panel_014~2_speech=<hero2> has it right. All that you may feel sure of--about the way things are, the nature of places and peoples--is shaped by the circumstances of your birth. Where you have lived, time was ever a going river.
~01~~panel_015~9_hero=I recognize a [i]Gorgon.
~01~~panel_016~2_speech=Every [i]aumary[] is one bank along its course, where we bend and dip our faces underwater, and view a single moment memorialized. It will never be one you recognize.
~01~~panel_017~2_speech=She is a Gorgon. And beside her fights a <legend.mf:man/human/human>.\nTo me, that means... [small]we are in a very [i]sad[] story.
~01~~panel_018~11_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[small]We knew them as a peaceful people./[small][face:grim]We knew them as a peaceful people./[small][face:grim]In my time, too, they were monsters. \nOf myth more than memory./Even for [i]me...[]>
~01~~panel_018~1_narration=The mighty Gorgon is almost entirely still, save for the small pulses \nunder her blue skin. Moisture from the falls shines on her, and on \nher armor. She has a fresh kelprose smell that is not unpleasant.

~01~~panel_019~12_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:I had never met one, but there was a great frieze on the temple wall, in Calmcourt. Apparently a gift to my and Soogen's ancestor.

~01~~panel_022~3_hero3=[small]Thuuedra's the name of our...[] she slew [i]Glindergast.[]
~01~~panel_023~11_legend=Six years! Since she pierced and brought down Old Galeblower! Only six years, and already, we Elns shrug to see her need so dire!
~01~~panel_024~11_legend=The Blattering Galeblower!
~01~~panel_024~3_hero3=Thuuedra was a [i]Gorgon?!
~01~~panel_025~2_speech=[i]The Silencing of Glindergast.

~01~~panel_026~2_speech=Glindergast. The Dragon of Spring.
~01~~panel_026~9_hero=[small]<hero.bookish/greedy/healer/leader/loner/poet/romantic/80:I remember that name. From maybe when I was a teenager? In some old book or something. Glin... der...?[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]Hey, am I supposed to know who [i]Glindablast[] is?/I'm maybe doing <hero2> a disservice, but I'm not sure we know that name.

So this [i]Gorgon,[] then, \nslew a famous... Glintagost?/Elthiar, help me out, please. This Gorgon \nkilled some sort of legendary... ghost?/Glinda-[i]huh?[] Was that a name or a [i]curseword?[]>
~01~~panel_027~9_hero=[small]She's a [i]dragonslayer...?[]
~01~~panel_028~2_speech=First dead of the dragons, who were born with the world. Meaning... I have finally met a lady I am [i]younger[] than.
~01~~panel_029~13_legend=It rendered her an outcast. She has paid [i]every[] price. \nSave for the one paid by her seven sisters. And so...
~01~~panel_030~13_legend=And so it is right that [i]one[] chieftain of the Elns, at least, will die beside her. Still, I am happier to do so in company.
~01~~panel_031~12_hero2=<hero2.bookish/coward/healer/leader/loner/poet/60:So these aren't her [i]attendants,[] I may presume...?[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]Quite a number of them. Did you have no time to [i]run?[] Or no place to... [small]escape to?/It's not good to go in thinking of death.[face:neutral]\nUnless, maybe, that just helps you fight?/They appear to be waiting for their own numbers to swell. Does that seem right?/That's not a small number over there./[face:skeptical]So they're gathering against her? To kill her? I can't understand why they'd... she [i]should[] be a hero.[small] She [i]is[] their great and lasting hero. In our lore./[face:skeptical]So those aren't friendly eyes out there.>
~01~~panel_032~1_narration=In the mist they glare across the glistening stones.

But it appears, \nat the last, [i]red blood...[] is as weak as they say./It is my pride as a warrior who sails the ocean, or once did. \nI will stare down my fate, and know its face, and not fear it./It is obvious. They are not yet convinced they can win, \nand so they hover out in the fog, the gormless [i]gheists![face:angry]/And yet they are not convinced they can win! \nSo they hover out in the fog, the gormless [i]gheists![face:angry]/She dared--when the conclave said "Hide, sink from sight under \nthe salt and be safe from dragonfire!"--[i]dared[] stand for the wider world! \nAnd now that world and its weak red blooded lice will not protect her![face:angry]/They gather to pull her apart, whom \nthey should vaunt as their greatest hero.>
~01~~panel_034~14_hero2=<hero2.bookish/coward/healer/leader/loner/poet/60:[face:grim]Then the move I'd suggest--I'm not trying to assert control, here, but--why not whittle at their ranks before they can fully gather?/[face:skeptical]Then... waiting's only going to make our odds worse.\nWon't it? Just tilt the numbers in their favor?/[face:grim]It's better to go in fast, then. Don't let them gather,\ntake the chance while their numbers still grow./[face:grim]Then now's when we charge them. If we wait, their position will only strengthen, is what I'm seeing. So let's move them off of it./[face:grim]To me, that says it's a good time \nto strike at them. And strike hard./If they're just growing their ranks, then let's \nscatter them. Let's not bide our time.[face:grim]/[face:talking]Feels like we should just go wreck them, then.
