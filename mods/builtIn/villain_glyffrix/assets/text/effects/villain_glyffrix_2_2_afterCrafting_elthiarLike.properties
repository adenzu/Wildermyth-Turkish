~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=The Forgemaster's artistry is swift as it is impossible. \n    Every rivet, every edge, every seam, and every spell.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=Every thought-of detail forms subtly, between \n      one banging hammerswing and another.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_speech=But none faster than [i]you.[] \nAnyway, work is work.

~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=He leaps down heavily, hitching \n himself to his wagon once more.

~01~prompt~panel_008~2_speech=[light]It'll stand till y'don't!
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_narration=He starts away, yanking the great forgewagon after him.
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_speech=[light]And don't y'all go forgettin' me, either...!

~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=The wagon follows its master, \n   and a great dustfog rises \n     to blot them both from view.

~01~prompt~panel_012~5_action=[tan][actionSmall]...joggle...\n[light]   ...junkle...
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_narration=The noise is soon beyond hearing.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_speech=And now, I am thinking...
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_speech=Better we were away as well.

~01~prompt~panel_018~2_speech=Anyway, there are some places--places like this--that [i]never[] change. These become crossings. Where the lost are wont to ramble through, and the hungry to congregate.
~01~prompt~panel_018~5_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic:[face:interested]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_speech=Anywhere's crossing is unsafe, but certainly this is more true in Nitherfaruwen than it has ever been in your lives.
