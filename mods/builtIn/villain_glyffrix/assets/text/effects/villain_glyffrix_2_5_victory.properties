~01~prompt~panel_001~1_darken=[ui][darkGreen][i]She is unreachable.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_darken=[ui][darkGreen][i]Unwarm and uncold,\n   unkind and uncruel.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_darken=[ui][darkGreen][i]She is not quite light, and not quite breath.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_darken=[light]I know.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_darken=[ui][darkGreen][i]Not quite life, and not quite death.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_darken=[ui][darkGreen][i]Her span is always, Her shrine the forest Therebetween.
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_darken=[ui][darkGreen][i]She is Oruwe.
~01~prompt~panel_003~4_darken=[light]I [i]know.[]
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_speech=And you suppose she\nis terribly aggrieved?
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]She is above such things.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_speech=But [i]you[] are not. [i]That[] part is strange to me.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]As my kind, \n     I felt nothing.
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]Once.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_speech=[ui][white][i]I entered Her forest,\n     seeking nothing.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_speech=[ui][white][i]Going inside was easy for me.
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_speech=[ui][white][i]Leaving, I found more difficult.
~01~prompt~panel_010~4_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~prompt~panel_010~5_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_speech=All you needed was the [i]desire[] to go.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_speech=That was impossible?
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]By my nature it was.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_speech=[ui][white][i]For a long while, I ignored Her beauty.
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_speech=[ui][white][i]When She spoke, I did not listen.
~01~prompt~panel_014~3_speech=[ui][white][i]Where She went I did not follow.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_speech=Long and not forever.
~01~prompt~panel_015~3_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]For a long while.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_speech=Once you looked, once you listened, once you followed her: desire was struck \naflame in you [i]then.[] Only, by that point, you no longer desired freedom...
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_speech=...smitten as you were.
~01~prompt~panel_018~3_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]So deep is the tragedy of that God\n      that feelings awakened in me.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_speech=Yes, [i]feelings.[] Fateful feelings.
~01~prompt~panel_020~3_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]I heard Her story.\n   And knew my purpose: \n     to be the one who could [b]hate[] in Her place.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_speech=You are Thrixl, so perhaps you never learned:\nit is [i]rude[] to feel on someone else's behalf.
~01~prompt~panel_022~7_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~prompt~panel_022~8_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_speech=Are you certain?
~01~prompt~panel_023~2_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]She was [b]wronged.[]
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_speech=I was not there. But Oruwe may well \nhave been [i]happy[] to relinquish--
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_speech=[ui][i][darkGray]She was [b]wronged!
~01~prompt~panel_025~2_speech=[ui][i][darkGreen]She was [b]wronged!
~01~prompt~panel_025~3_speech=[ui][i][darkBlue]She was [b]wronged!
~01~prompt~panel_027~3_speech=You can't love who will never love [i]you.
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_narration=Out of the blazing teeth of the forest...
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_narration=...into the relative cool of Netherflare...
~01~prompt~panel_030~1_narration=...they staggered together, exhausted, around a cageflame.
~01~prompt~panel_030~2_narration=It's a while they've hunkered there, now.
~01~prompt~panel_031~4_hero3=It leaves no trace, does it?
~01~prompt~panel_032~3_speech=An [i]aumary[] leaves no trace. Yes.
~01~prompt~panel_033~5_hero=<hero.elthiarLike:/[face:skeptical]>You mean... [small][i]love?
~01~prompt~panel_034~3_speech=Nothing you can touch.
~01~prompt~panel_034~7_hero3=No trace at [i]all.[]
~01~prompt~panel_037~3_speech=I did not say that.
~01~prompt~panel_037~4_hero3=So none of this really matters?
~01~prompt~panel_039~4_hero3=[i]I'm[] saying it.
~01~prompt~panel_040~4_hero3=I stepped out of a [i]dollhouse.[] Is basically what you've told me. \nA sad, little... summer-scene... in some forgotten room.
~01~prompt~panel_041~2_legend=<npc2.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/60:[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:interested]>
~01~prompt~panel_041~3_hero3=My entire world. Was a drama of dolls.
~01~prompt~panel_042~4_hero3=It was [i]someone's[] life. Right? Or maybe even less... maybe it was their [i]if.[] Someone's \ndiscarded [i]if.[] The dark possibility they dreamed of on their bad nights.
~01~prompt~panel_043~4_hero3=Am I not understanding?
~01~prompt~panel_044~4_hero3=I feel like I [i]lived[] that life, but I... am just a doll<hero3.mf:-man/-woman/>. A toy. Taken off the table, and the table cleared away. Now I flop along, and raggedly swing my arms. There's a name stitched to my chest, but it's not really my name. Is that right? [i]Isn't[] that right?
~01~prompt~panel_045~4_hero3=<hero4>, too.
~01~prompt~panel_045~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested][small]I...?/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_046~3_speech=You seem to think--
~01~prompt~panel_047~4_hero3=Where is [i]your[] home, Elthiar?
~01~prompt~panel_047~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>

~01~prompt~panel_049~8_hero=<hero.elthiarLike:<hero.rivalOf.hero3:[face:grim]Want me to tell <hero3.mf:him/her/them> to be quiet?/[face:interested]I... [i]also[] would like to know.>/[face:interested]I wondered that, too.>
~01~prompt~panel_050~3_speech=I dreaded the day I might enter an [i]aumary.[]

~01~prompt~panel_051.(hero_is_elthiarLike)~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_051.(hero_is_elthiarLike)~8_hero=<hero.rivalOf.hero3:[face:grim]Or should I shut my [i]own[] mouth?/[face:neutral]But I don't [i]have[] to know.>
~01~prompt~panel_052.(hero_NOT_elthiarLike)~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_052.(hero_NOT_elthiarLike)~8_hero=But you don't have to answer.
~01~prompt~panel_053~3_speech=I would be reminded of the youth of the sun. I dreaded it. Moon on the mountains. Green trees and water. Crowsong, and wolfsong, the wind. Stars, and starlight, the night.
~01~prompt~panel_053~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_054~3_speech=But I am lucky, in a sense. I am not like you.
~01~prompt~panel_054~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_055~1_speech=Home is a smell I hate remembering.
~01~prompt~panel_058~3_speech=Home is a thing that holds its place. Holds its shape.
~01~prompt~panel_058~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_059~3_speech=[i]Viciously,[] it lasts.
~01~prompt~panel_059~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_060~3_speech=Decaying around its own bones.
~01~prompt~panel_060~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_061~3_speech=You have not asked, but I will tell you: \nwandering is far better. And better [i]far.[]
~01~prompt~panel_061~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_062~3_speech=It is better not to see things die.
~01~prompt~panel_062~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_063~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_064~3_speech=So maybe you suppose it matters where you started. It does not.
~01~prompt~panel_064~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_065~3_speech=Being is all. If you can firmly [i]be,[] then what does a name mean? Cast it off. What is your past? It only fades. What you are, in this moment, is everything you are.
~01~prompt~panel_065~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_066~3_speech=And that goes for what you are doing. And where you are heading.
~01~prompt~panel_066~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>Your advice, then... is to give a shrug.\nA wide wink to existence. And carry on?
~01~prompt~panel_067~3_speech=I know, to some, that will sound like a lot of responsibility. "Easier to be what I have been."
~01~prompt~panel_067~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_068~3_speech=And to others, it will sound like the opposite. Abandoning your expired missions. Leaving old dreams derelict. Can be wrenching.
~01~prompt~panel_068~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_069~3_speech=Anyway, you will make the choice when you have to make the choice.\nIn the meantime... I know it is fun to agonize...[small] over these inevitable things.
~01~prompt~panel_069~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_070~10_hero3=I... don't understand you.
~01~prompt~panel_070~11_hero=[small]No?

~01~prompt~panel_072~8_hero=She... [small]isn't that strange...
~01~prompt~panel_073~1_narration=Like sudden birds from a late autumn tree...
~01~prompt~panel_073~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~prompt~panel_074~1_narration=...<hero>'s feelings spread aloft before <hero.mf:his/her/their> eyes. \n       And <hero.mf:he/she/they> can plainly see them.

~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_darken=It began as a rogue and random wish. \n    An unwary and wild attraction.

It almost feels too planned, too... I don't know. But. You thinks it's good to resist it.[face:grim]/[face:talking]There's a sense of it being preordained. That you'll trust her. And that seems like a very good reason not to. Mm. And/in some ways, it feels like... the story in your head, about who you are and what's important. She [i]damages[] it, somehow. I think[face:interested]/you feel a little dumb if you just accept what she tells you. She [i]smiles.[] And you can't imagine she's even half-honest.> I felt like that. At the start.
