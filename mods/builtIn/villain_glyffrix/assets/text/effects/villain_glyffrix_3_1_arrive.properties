~01~~panel_042~4_hero2=I [i]do[] have a couple questions.
~01~~panel_043~5_legend=Been a real hassle to keep and collect, but, these days... \n[small]I get affectionate of almost [i]anything[] that... lives and dies.
~01~~panel_044~4_hero2=Yeah. Then, the other is less my business, but--
~01~~panel_044~7_legend=Your first is probably...? Yes. There's no doing this quiet \nor quick enough that we won't draw [i]some[] attention.
~01~~panel_045~4_hero2=[small][i]Mm.
~01~~panel_045~6_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]Do you not worry you will be discovered? \nCan you go [i]back,[] can you play innocent?/[face:grim]It will be obvious who has done this.

~01~~panel_046~5_legend=They have enemies, our Queen and King.
~01~~panel_047~5_legend=Was that your question? They have [i]many[] enemies.

~01~~panel_048~5_legend=We can make it look like their work, and it'll be convincing [i]enough.[] We're not \ndealing with any great [i]investigators,[] here, and... I should be hard to suspect.
~01~~panel_049~2_legend=<legend.personality:It's interesting./I...[face:interested] [small]think so? But./[face:interested][i]Hm!/Tch![face:dubious]/[face:neutral][small]I [i]hope[] so./[face:grim]Pff! /[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral][small][i]Hmm./[small]I [i]hope[] so./[face:neutral]Hm.>

~01~~panel_050~5_legend=Anyway, the things I have swallowed, without complaint, in order to maintain my... [small]yeah.[] \nIn all but my [i]heart,[] I am theirs. And will [i]appear[] so, even on close inspection.
~01~~panel_051~5_legend=And that's also why... it's increasingly important to me. \nTo keep up the fight, in whatever small ways I can.
~01~~panel_052~2_speech=And whoever [i]does[] catch sight of us...?
~01~~panel_052~5_legend=They must die. No mistakes, no exceptions.
