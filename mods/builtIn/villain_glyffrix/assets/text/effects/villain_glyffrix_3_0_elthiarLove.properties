~01~~panel_002~1_narration=A castle is then there.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Through a window in the rocks they see its spires twisting.
~01~~panel_003~2_speech=Don't laugh.

~01~~panel_010~1_narration=At the next glance, it's gone. Replaced by mute horizon.

~01~~panel_010~6_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:happy]>
~01~~panel_011~2_speech=Yes. It grows and grows. Less and less\ndoes the dragon ever leave it.

~01~~panel_016~7_speech=[darkBlue]We don't need to charm \n  each other, my dear.
~01~~panel_017~7_speech=[darkBlue]You know better than most: there's \n   deeper than darkness in this realm I rule.
~01~~panel_018~7_speech=[darkBlue]Perhaps you didn't realize your road goes through it?
~01~~panel_019~2_speech=[i]"And each star would flee seeing, a free windborne kite,  \nbut is bound to the ballast of the world of unlight."[]
~01~~panel_020~2_speech=That is Nitherfaruwen. I read this proposed cosmology, that \ncreation balances around this world, this little black weight. \nAnd so holds together, straining to keep us afloat.

~01~~panel_022~4_hero2=[small]What?

~01~~panel_022~9_hero3=Hm.
~01~~panel_023~2_speech=Nothing. [small]Just...[] I [i]should[] have been less confident. About the danger you would face. My own talent, my ability to ward your steps.
~01~~panel_023~6_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~~panel_024~3_hero2=That last one. The [i]aumary.[]
~01~~panel_025~2_speech=But as I once told you, I had made certainty my way. \nI am in [i]no[] way certain what lies ahead, here and after.
~01~~panel_025~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]/[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_026~3_hero2=Suddenly, we were in the trees. And surrounded by wildfire. \nIt just hit us out of nowhere, this time. Like a night rain.
~01~~panel_027~2_speech=And I saw no sign, or way to prevent it.
~01~~panel_027~8_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]>
~01~~panel_027~9_hero2=So we can expect it will keep happening.

~01~~panel_031~10_hero3=Your [i]bow,[] anyway... is strong. Your aim is good.
~01~~panel_031~11_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_032~11_hero3=You fight well for us.
~01~~panel_032~12_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:happy]/[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]>
~01~~panel_033~1_narration=They travel the land in front of them. \n    Fog capes the crags of this black nameless shire.
