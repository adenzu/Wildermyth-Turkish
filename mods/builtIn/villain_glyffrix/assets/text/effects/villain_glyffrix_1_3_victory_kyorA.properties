~01~~panel_001~1_narration=One moment they're careening through the catacombs under Calmcourt, the besieged Kyoren capitol...
~01~~panel_001~2_hero2=...[i]have[] to... [small]*huff*[] ...keep running...!
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=...and the next...
~01~~panel_002~2_hero4=I...[small]cannot run anym...!!
~01~~panel_003~2_hero4=[small]...mmm...more.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=The warm wind of Netherflare combs them over,\nits murk and mineral scent grown familiar.
~01~~panel_005~4_hero=It's almost pleasant, now.
~01~~panel_006~4_hero4=Did we...? [small]Escape the...?
~01~~panel_006~5_hero3=Seems so.
~01~~panel_007~3_hero2=Here, let's talk.
~01~~panel_007~4_hero4=But... [small]the [i]sky...[]
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=Again, <hero2> wrings the weird truth out for young <hero4> to absorb.
~01~~panel_008~3_hero2=...which is why <hero3.mf:he/she/they>--why <hero3>--came along.
~01~~panel_008~4_hero3=[small]Mm, it's...
~01~~panel_009~4_hero3=And, same as you, I don't know much. Don't know if I'm even [i]me,[] or just a... [small]a [i]figment[] of me? But. []I [i]am conscious.
~01~~panel_010~7_hero4=[small]And maybe it's that.
~01~~panel_011~6_hero2=<hero>.
~01~~panel_012~4_hero3=It could really just be [i]that.[] Clinging to consciousness. Worried I'll otherwise... \njust be... asleep in that memory forever.
~01~~panel_013~5_hero=Not much out there. Dug up some of this cabbagey \nstuff you love. Did we hear <hero4>'s story?
~01~~panel_014~2_hero4=Captain <npc2>... saves my life. [small]Does it [i]twice,[] actually.
~01~~panel_014~3_hero2=Yeah, it's like with <hero3>. Fights that battle.\nOver and over again. [i]Survives,[] though.
~01~~panel_015~2_hero4=I know, at least, that when I am old... \nold and remembering... I die.
~01~~panel_016~7_hero4=Which really feels like a funny thing... to be... looking [i]back[] on.
~01~~panel_016~8_hero3=[small]Yeah?
~01~~panel_017~1_narration=Maybe the dark smells \n     a little like old morning frost.
~01~~panel_018~1_narration=<hero> remembers winter walks with <hero.mf:his/her/their> mother. The \npinecone path wobbling where <hero.mf:his/her/their> young eyes went.
~01~~panel_019~1_narration=And the next moment, though <hero.mf:he knows/she knows/they know> it was real,\nnone of it feels firmer than a favorite story.
~01~~panel_019~2_narration=Might it not be a dream? A dream escaping \nits cradle. Playing in the clothes of a memory.
~01~~panel_020~1_narration=Sleep comes in unsteady spells.
~01~~panel_021~1_narration=But, waking, they troop off together.
~01~~panel_021~2_narration=Four strong.
~01~~panel_021~7_hero4=Does she know?
~01~~panel_022~8_hero=Hm?
~01~~panel_023~7_hero4=I mean, that you are looking for her? [i]Elthiar[] is the name?
~01~~panel_024~8_hero=I [i]wonder.[] Maybe. The good thing is...\nthe further we go, the more [i]sure[] I feel.
~01~~panel_025~8_hero=It's all I want. To find her. More and more,\nit's the only thing I hope for.
~01~~panel_025~9_hero4=What do you mean by s...
~01~~panel_026~10_hero4=So. This is a story of faith.
~01~~panel_026~11_hero=[i]Hm?
~01~~panel_027~11_hero4=Is it not?
~01~~panel_028~11_hero=<hero.personality:[face:skeptical][small]Depends on... depends on \nyour definition, I guess./[small]No, it's... I don't know. I guess, \nwhat [i]is[] faith? Do [i]I[] really know?/[small][face:interested]No, that just sounds too... [i]weird.[] \nHeavy, or meaningful, or something./[face:skeptical][small]It's a story about me getting my \npeace of mind, back. Is what it is./[face:neutral][small]Mm. That's one way to put it, maybe./[face:grim][small]Call it what you want. For [i]me,[] it's \nabout surviving. Plain and simple./[face:neutral][small]If that's how you want to understand it,\nI'm fine with that. You won't offend me./[small][face:neutral]I don't even know what that means./[small][face:interested]In some significant ways... [i]yes.[] Words \nlike faith mean a lot of things, though./[small]Does [i]faith[] feel at all like...? Hm./[small][face:grim][i]Knew[] we should've \nsaved the other one.>
