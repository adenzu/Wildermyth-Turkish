~01~~panel_007~2_speech=Merely puzzled. Why you accepted that dragon's invitation.\nTo attend a mysterious ball in another world.

~01~~panel_010~4_hero2=I think we should hear from you, first. Why don't you explain what that means? Not losing your way.
~01~~panel_011~2_speech=You are being evasive.

~01~~panel_012~2_speech=Well, I suppose I would be an awful hypocrite if I took issue.
~01~~panel_012~5_hero=<hero.elthiarLike:[small]It's okay if.../[small][face:neutral]Least she [i]knows.[]>
~01~~panel_013~2_speech=There is not [i]so[] much to understand.

~01~~panel_014~1_narration=Their path is a constant twisting among vale and spire.\nRoadless, with rarely any obvious mark or made feature.

~01~~panel_016~2_speech=When navigating upon your Good Green World, \nyou tend to rely on a lodestar. Is this not true?
~01~~panel_017~6_hero2=Mm, sometimes. Or sometimes constellations. \nIn familiar places, it's roads and landmarks.
~01~~panel_018~2_speech=Yes. Yet you see our sky is starless. Lit only by chains that flow and change. Few things are permanently decided, here. We cannot even trust the land to hold its form and place.

~01~~panel_019~2_speech=That cliff, where we passed through the door? \nIt has been a canyon, a field, a forest.

~01~~panel_020~2_speech=Put simply, yes. Nothing here is very polite. About \nstaying the proper distance away from other things.

~01~~panel_022~2_speech=So, in Nitherfaruwen, in Netherflare, where we cannot trust anything past our fingers, it is our grasping hands that serve as the constant. Plainly put, your lodestar is [i]desire.[]
~01~~panel_023~2_speech=Your own desire can guide you surely. From here to that silly castle, or wherever you will.
~01~~panel_024~2_speech=And, provided you can want to go where your intention is to be, you will rarely be surprised.
~01~~panel_025~8_hero=<hero.bookish/healer/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:Aligning...[small] [i]want...[][face:skeptical] with [i]intention?[] Might be ludicrously hard?/Sorry, but that's... hm./[face:grim]/[small]Want?[] And intention? Hm./How... poetic, it sounds.../Well. [face:skeptical][i]What?[]/[small]As[]... long as you can...>
~01~~panel_026~7_hero2=<hero2.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/poet/60:I suspect you're oversimplifying, because.../[face:interested]That [i]can't[] be all, can it? I mean, with... [i]yeah.[]/[face:skeptical]Isn't that just [i]crazy,[] though? And random?/[face:talking]I'm not [i]doubting[] you, but... that feels too simple./[face:neutral]But that only works for one person./That [i]feels[] too... what do I mean, [i]simple?[]>
~01~~panel_027~2_speech=Your choice. To [i]follow me.[] It sounds flimsy, but even a mostly tacit ordering of wills can bind our bearings into one.
~01~~panel_027~7_hero2=Because what keeps us together, then? \nI doubt we're all perfectly similar in our...?
~01~~panel_028~2_speech=In both cases, you [i]will[] be lost. And in peril.
~01~~panel_028~6_hero=What if you don't [i]know[] what you want?\nOr what if the thing you want... isn't here?
~01~~panel_029~2_speech=You don't avoid it. Getting lost is how you learn. \nNot just here, but everywhere. In every pursuit.
~01~~panel_029~6_hero=But then how do you avoid that if--?[face:skeptical]
~01~~panel_030~2_speech=I think it [i]must[] be.
~01~~panel_030~5_hero=Is that actually true?
~01~~panel_031~6_hero2=Well...
~01~~panel_032~2_speech=After all, I did say it.
~01~~panel_033~2_speech=Yes?
~01~~panel_034~7_hero2=So. Elthiar?
~01~~panel_035~2_speech=How did... I learn these things?
~01~~panel_035~7_hero2=How did that happen? For you?
~01~~panel_035~8_hero=Yeah.<hero.elthiarLike:[face:interested]/>
~01~~panel_036~2_speech=Mm. For me... in the span of my existence, \nyou are asking about my childhood.
~01~~panel_036~8_hero=<hero.elthiarLike:[face:interested]Is that... [small]so [i]very[] long ago?/How long ago is that?>
~01~~panel_037~2_speech=I can only make sense of time as it ties together \nmy own memories. But, if I think on it...
~01~~panel_038~2_speech=It was when I kept coming [i]back.[]
~01~~panel_039~2_speech=And back.
~01~~panel_040~2_speech=And back. To one peaceful place along a river. The only place, as I had wandered, where I felt calm. And safe.
~01~~panel_041~2_speech=I was deeply frustrated, as you might imagine. How would \nI ever [i]escape?[] I thought I was imprisoned, you see.
~01~~panel_041~5_hero=<hero.elthiarLike:/[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_043~2_speech=Eventually, I recognized it. That as soon as my heart \nstopped wanting to return there... I stopped.
~01~~panel_044~2_speech=Despair came. For then there was nothing I wanted in this world \nthat I could ever find. I wound up in other places.
~01~~panel_045~2_speech=No, hope is what made me vulnerable.
~01~~panel_045~7_hero=[face:neutral]And something gave you hope again.
~01~~panel_046~2_speech=Hope is wild, and lovely, and it can be strong as a tree. \nBut it is not everlasting. And the deeper its root goes, \nthe deeper hole is left when it dies.
~01~~panel_047~2_speech=I needed certainty.
~01~~panel_048~2_speech=Certainty is the sister of insanity.
~01~~panel_049~2_speech=Certainty allows you to master your desires.
~01~~panel_050~2_speech=Pure certainty eclipses even truth.
~01~~panel_051~2_speech=I wandered long and lost. Before I achieved it. This sureness \nI feel, that must spark against your reasoning eyes.

~01~~panel_055.(hero_is_elthiarLike)~2_speech=A word for us who dwell here. Cast by one god or another to wander in darkness for our crimes, however ancient they be.

That's... something. I don't know, I don't have a word./Which means [i]gods.[] A thing I don't know [i]I've[] ever solidly...

~01~~panel_057.(hero_is_elthiarLike)~2_speech=For a long enough while? You will change. Or you will die.
~01~~panel_057.(hero_is_elthiarLike)~5_hero2=If [i]we[] become lost, down here...
~01~~panel_059.(hero_is_elthiarLike)~2_speech=So consider yourselves forewarned: don't squamble off.
~01~~panel_060.(hero_NOT_elthiarLike)~4_speech=I am. That word refers to those, such as myself,\ncast here to lose our way.
~01~~panel_060.(hero_NOT_elthiarLike)~5_hero2=<hero2.personality:[face:neutral]I'm reminded, as I often am... especially on journeys... how little understanding I have.

People call me 'Greedwagon.'[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]I'm sorry if it gives you any pain.

Just asking, so I know./[face:talking]You're pretty ready with the truth, when it comes down to it./[face:neutral]You seem unbothered./[face:neutral]Words can have a lot of weight./And that's why you warned me I shouldn't hope to meet another./It's nice you haven't devoured our souls, yet.[face:happy]>
~01~~panel_061.(hero_NOT_elthiarLike)~4_speech=<hero2.personality:That is a sign of intellect./I hope to avoid meeting any others./An estranged family, maybe? You can smile at me, but don't smile at [i]them.[][hero2.face:interested]/We can choose to take up the titles others ascribe to us. Or we can leave them on the mountainside.[hero2.face:interested]/I wonder if it [i]does?[] Hurt, in some way.\nPain itself feels a long way off./[hero2.face:happy]That would certainly be exciting, hm?/Sometimes an unspoken truth is tanglesome.\n[i]Often,[] I feel, that is the case./I am alive. What about [i]words[] can bother me?/Which is why I don't like to carry them myself. You are free to use what language you like./We are most of us unkind. And unreasonable.\nI am by all measures an aberration./[hero2.face:skeptical]Would you perceive the difference, if I had?>
~01~~panel_062.(hero_NOT_elthiarLike)~2_speech=You would change.
~01~~panel_062.(hero_NOT_elthiarLike)~6_hero=<hero2>, can you ask... do you think \nif [i]we[] were to get lost...?
~01~~panel_064.(hero_NOT_elthiarLike)~2_speech=Or else... well. I suppose you have already met the wildlife.
~01~~panel_064.(hero_NOT_elthiarLike)~3_hero=[small]Yeah...?
~01~~panel_065~1_narration=Sleep is not easily captured under a haunted sky.
~01~~panel_066~1_narration=They wake, unsure how long they rested.
~01~~panel_066~2_narration=And set off again.
~01~~panel_067~5_speech=Now we are passing by the breath of an Aumary.
~01~~panel_068~5_speech=No. To reach where we are going, I must \nkeep my heart on the castledoor.
~01~~panel_068~6_hero2=Doing what? From what we talked about yesterd... I'll just say yesterday. From what we talked about, navigation and all... this's the way you [i]wanted[] to go?
~01~~panel_069~5_speech=Between me and there, the [i]path[]\ndecides how it will unfurl.
