~01~~panel_001~6_narration=Unseen insects strum in the knee-high grass, \nthickening their music as the damp night deepens.

~01~~panel_003~8_npc3=What could they take, your [i]pinecones?
~01~~panel_004.(subPlot_exists)~2_action=[actionSmall][green]gyoom!?
~01~~panel_005~3_speech=I don't know. I think I left \nMom's mirror on the table.
~01~~panel_007~8_npc3=We won't be gone too long.
~01~~panel_008~3_narration=The witch waits exactly in her place.
~01~~panel_009~2_speech=[aqua]I should have expected you might bring your sister.
~01~~panel_010~5_npc3=We've been told you sent help for us. I'm Eluna. This's Elsee.
~01~~panel_012~3_speech=[i]Huh?
~01~~panel_012~4_npc3=[gray][i]Elsee-girl, []don't [i]stare.
~01~~panel_013~1_speech=What [i]is[] your plan, Sorceress? I ask \nwithout expecting to be told.
~01~~panel_013~4_npc3=[i][gray][small]Else.
~01~~panel_014~2_speech=[aqua]I have no reason not to say: \nI plan to take them away.
~01~~panel_015~2_speech=[aqua]These two girls. Far away from tonight, we \nwill go, and from this memory. I will lead them.
~01~~panel_016~2_speech=[aqua]Far away, you know, \n   there is a great door.
~01~~panel_017~2_speech=[aqua]On the other side, a world akin to the one they knew,\nbut where they may live, at least once, good lives.
~01~~panel_017~3_speech=[small]Don't get left behind!
~01~~panel_018~2_speech=[aqua]Anyone may go who may find\ntheir way. Or else is led.
~01~~panel_018~3_speech=[small][gray]Um.
~01~~panel_019~1_speech=Is that possible? They can... [i]go?[]
~01~~panel_020~3_speech=[gray][small]Hey.
~01~~panel_020~4_npc3=[gray]Shh, I don't know, but I think we're safe.
~01~~panel_021~2_speech=[aqua]We will travel now. You must\nbe braced in your hearts.
~01~~panel_021~4_npc3=Hm? [small][i]Mm.[]
~01~~panel_022~1_narration=Her robe ruffles as she turns. It's almost surprising that the crow woman's gliding footfalls leave any impression in the clover. Her small dark prints stitch towards the trees.
~01~~panel_022~4_speech=[small]She smells like that scrubbing soap... you got once.
~01~~panel_022~5_npc3=[small]She [i]does.[]

~01~~panel_046.(hero_is_eLove)~1_speech=I had many books. And maps. Star-charts, models. Art and poetry.
~01~~panel_047.(hero_is_eLove)~1_speech=[i]These...[] are not the constellations as I remember them. Their positions have slipped. Their light has atrophied. They are old, like I will never be.

~01~~panel_050.(hero_is_eLove)~1_speech=People are much the same. We glimmer from not so far off, so it is natural to hope: that familiarity is possible. That one might come to truly know another.
~01~~panel_051.(hero_is_eLove)~1_speech=But in the end you will always find... there is so much more than distance to divide us.
~01~~panel_053.(hero_is_eLove)~1_speech=They remain very beautiful. These stars. \nSaltshine stars. Of a yondering not mine.
~01~~panel_055.(hero_is_eLove)~2_hero=My mom and dad are both <hero.whm:stonecarvers/woodworkers/tailors>.

Don't want to all be naked, do we?> [small]Just.../Voice in my head was saying not to close that door: [i]'You've got a good start, you've got your parents' shop. It's fine to be comfortable.'/In fact, a big part of me felt like I'd be letting them down if I... tried anything else. And I [i]still[] feel sorry to them. A little.[face:happy]/And that's good work, right? Part of me's kind of mad at myself that I just shrugged it off. At fourteen. [small]But things... call to you.[][face:skeptical]/There was a part of me, for sure, until I was maybe thirteen or fourteen, that saw it as my fate. My inheritance, my [i]duty.[] Something like that.[face:grim]/[i]Would've[] been, except... [i]commerce.[] I got sick of all the commerce in our house. Dishonest smiles. [small]Affectations.[] And... yeah, so. I took [i]this[] path.[face:neutral]/I saw the merits of the craft. Understood the methods of... [i]<hero.whm:'Unseal the breathing of the stone/'Let the wood say what's been on its mind/'Good clothes don't [ni]adorn[] the form, they [ni]awaken[] it>.'[] I was skilled enough to mimic their art./[face:happy]Funny, the... I guess [i]<hero.whm:stonework/woodwork/needlework>[] wasn't heroic enough. You don't know my home, but I [i]had[] heroes right in front of me. Idols to adore./[face:skeptical]I can safely claim so.

Because.../Things call to you, and what're you going to do?/But a calling comes to you. Or it did to me./Avoiding my [i]fate[] kind of led me to my [i]fate,[] you could say./But I got to feeling it would only ever be mimicry. I was fourteen./And I wanted to find something... [i]better[] than my parents did./It was strong. But that wasn't really the chief thing.> <hero.personality:And partially, this's just... me intellectualizing about my own... [i]passions,[] maybe. After the fact.[face:grim]/I think I'm actually motivated a lot by my fear, and... I always hope... [small]maybe fruitlessly...[] that people don't see me that way. But./[face:happy]I'd go back in time and make myself quit sooner, if I could. Tell myself to read up on [i]Netherflare.[] [i]Nitherfaruwen,[] I'd even risk calling it. Risk mockery./I wanted so much more from life, even though, I'll admit now, I had no concept of what else there really [i]could[] be. I was [i]bent.[] On.../See, suffering was all around me, growing up. But never in my own house. I am grateful for that, but it left me feeling guilty.[face:neutral]/It's maybe a little obvious, now--or it's what you'd think--that I'm someone who'd rush off to play <hero.whm:knight/the ranger/wizard>, but I swear, I wasn't a brave <hero.mf:boy/girl/kid>. I was unsure.[face:interested]/[face:grim]I'm not always someone who [i]knows[] the right way to do things. No one would claim that of me... or say it about themselves, probably. /I never like to come across as someone who thinks <hero.mf:he's/she's/they're> especially [i]different.[] So I hate saying this to you now, but... I [i]do[] think I'm different. From others? [small]Not sure why.[face:grim]/You might know I love language, and meaning, and... see, I think a life is largely lived in [i]search[] of... words to put to meaning. A thoughtful life./[face:neutral]I don't know. Do you find me silly? People find me silly, and they feel like, [i]'There's <hero>, <hero.mf:he's/she's/they've> got <hero.mf:his/her/their> head stuck in a dream.'[] It's... [small]difficult, sometimes, actually./I must've been a genius kid, don't you agree? Now I'm here, struggling to live through ghost-fights, struggling to... [small]come to grips with my own... mm.[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_057.(hero_is_eLove)~2_hero=<hero.personality:Just... my true interest [i]is[] knowing. And always was. All that I can know, even if knowing [i]itself[] is ephemeral. I'm so curious, Elthiar... I'm so, [i]so[] curious. What makes that star up there shine. Why should the castleruins root round each other? What will [i]you[] do? After this.[face:talking]/I've got a lot of interests I never pursued. Because I was scared that, if I didn't make myself a person who [i]fought[] for other people, for <hero.mf:his/her/their> home... I'd be up shunned. Not respected by anyone I respected, and... but now. Elthiar? I find myself caring less. And wanting [i]more./And that [i]would,[] I'm sure, earn the mockery of young me. [face:happy]But I'd [i]educate[] that <hero.mf:boy/girl/child>, anyway. Make <hero.mf:him/her/them> more disciplined. So that at this moment, now, I could say more to you, Elthiar, than that... I really like being [i]with[] you. On whatever road this is./[face:grim]I don't know. There was this dream of saving the town, saving the whole world, probably. But not for anyone's sake, really, just because it would give [i]me...[] value. I don't have that dream now, I'm realizing. I'm not sure if the new dream's any more [i]humble.[] Elthiar. [small]Orufel./[face:talking]There's something very selfish in that guilt, I know. But it did press me. Pushed me forward. Into what I've become. So I thank my [i]guilt,[] too. That I'm at this point, on this hill. Telling you [i]I[] love starlight. I treasure my time alone. I also like listening to people tell me their stories. /[face:talking]I think... the thing that always frustrates me is when I can see, clearly, what I [i]wish[] for. And feel like there's no obvious way to make it happen. I feel like I have to take [i]any[] action, then, just in case it works. It's kind of what my whole life's been. And it's what [i]this[] is, now. Elthiar.[face:grim]/No one you'd trust.[face:interested] The thing I've always been able to do, though, is just make the choice that's there. And help other people make it with me. It was important to me, then, that my parents were still behind me. And, Elthiar, there's another choice I'm preparing to make./[face:neutral]I always thought so. I've struggled to sort of... to know how much of it was delusion, how much of it was [i]rebellion.[] And how much of it was true. But at the core... Elthiar, I've never been so alive, or felt so... [i]wishful.[] So [i]yearn-[]heavy. As I have on this journey. With you./[face:interested]I've found so much down here--and I mean, in [i]Nitherfaruwen.[] Found [i]ideas[] I'd never approached before, observed new [i]natures[]. And like you said at the start, I found beauty, too. Even just [i]hearing[] your story. Of Oruwe. And Orufel. [small]'I am always learning, afresh, the [i]rainsong.'[] Someone wrote./Because it's [i]kind[] of true. That I do get caught up in sort of... a wish for how the world might be. A wish for how my life might change, and who I might... have that adventure with. But it's not wholly an accident. That I lose myself? I feel I have a [i]power.[] I feel tremendously lucky.[face:grim]/[face:talking]It's kind of nuts, and it's kind of perfect. It's kind of the perfect way for me to die. [i]Or[] live. Or I just mean... where would the <hero.mf:boy/girl/child> wind up, who never could say to anyone straight, I want you to be happy. And [i]I[] want to be happy. And I'm going to do whatever I can... [small]so that... yeah.[] >
~01~~panel_058.(hero_is_eLove)~2_hero=<hero.personality:[face:neutral]And as someone who's made knowing <hero.mf:his/her/their> pursuit, what if I...? So I can tell you, right now, I love to watch the flight of dragonflies. Without seriousness. I just like it./I find myself growing more resolute. And isn't that something strange? It could be the first of many changes.[face:interested] Or it could be a thing I'm only discovering now... [small]that was always... there./[face:interested]Actually, maybe that's perfect, huh? I like being with you. I also like songs, and I like bundling up warm, when it's cold. And when I tell small truths like this... [small]Yeah.[] [i]Yeah.[]/[face:neutral]But it's simple, kind of. And just dreaming it makes me happy. [i]There's[] something you didn't know, but do now./[face:neutral]I like wandering. In this dark place.\nAnd I would even... for the sum of... [small]mm.[]/My argument is... telling you what I like: I like sudden changes of weather, when I don't have the right clothes on. It excites me. Unpreparedness. [i]Moves[] me.[face:talking]/[face:happy]It starts with telling you... I liked going to creaks and ponds when the year's dragonflies were young. [small]You [i]didn't[] know that./[face:grim]Which's why I'm talking so much. Sorry. I'm sure it's odd to hear. But it's gotten important to me. I've changed, at least a little.
