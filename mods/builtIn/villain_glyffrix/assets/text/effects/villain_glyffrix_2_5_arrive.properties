~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Flames crawl on the forest floor.
~01~~panel_003~2_narration=The sap under healthy bark cooks and pops.
~01~~panel_004~6_hero2=[small]...thiar?
~01~~panel_005~5_hero2=What [i]happened?[]
~01~~panel_006~3_speech=Somehow.
~01~~panel_006~5_hero2=We stepped [i]through?[]
~01~~panel_007~5_hero2=Then where are we?
~01~~panel_008~4_action=[gray][actionSmall]...whhheeeymm...

~01~~panel_011~3_hero2=<hero2.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/poet/romantic/80:...so a [i]concept[] is all I ever thought Netherflare was. Right? A \nconvenient setting for parables. And other unreal things.[face:talking]/[face:happy]...and I even used to lose sleep over... stories of Netherflare, of Lostlings. \nI had to willfully stop believing in them. At a certain point. [small]So I could live./...so I [i]believed[] in Netherflare, in a way.[face:happy] Not because there was any reason to, \nbut kind of because there wasn't. I thought that would make people crazy./...and I wanted to believe in Lostlings. Netherflare. I mean, I think I wondered if I [i]could[] believe in them. Because if I [i]could...[] I would be free to believe in better things, too.[face:happy]/[face:talking]...so there was always the worry... what if there [i]is[] a place we go after we die? \nWill we still be us? Will we remember what mattered to us? And should we want to?/...and we passed through that door. I felt as if I would be plunging into a sea.\nBut it's stranger than that. I drink the water. I walk the hills. I sing. And inhale./[face:talking]...and I was always this way. Believed in Netherflare all my life. [i]All[] those stories. Which's why, when that invitation came, it wasn't hard for <hero> to convince me./<hero2.hothead/leader/loner/snark:[face:talking]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]/[face:skeptical]>...so I was never convinced. <hero2.loner/80:If Lostlings existed, why would anyone know about them? \nAnd I still wonder. I wonder about the [i]others.[] Do you mostly avoid them?/[i]Netherflare?[] Lostlings? Those were tools to raise quiet kids, I always figured. [small]I don't know.[] I mean... is it a [i]community?[] Lostlings, I mean. [small]People like you?>>
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=No warning, no portal, no passing-line.
~01~~panel_012~3_speech=<hero2.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/poet/romantic/80:A mether from which to drink your morals, that you might grow \ntall and virtuous. Yes, I know. I think that is a fine use for it./A powerful imagination causes us to suffer. But it also teaches us unique lessons. \nNow you know how to pare unhelpful beliefs, thoughts, memories from your mind.[hero2.face:interested]/[hero2.face:joy]<hero.elthiarLike:I see that you are exactly the sort of person who would place <hero2.mf:his/her/their> trust in \nanother's young and windy heart. So at least [i]that[] is now making sense./I now can clearly see why you wound up back at the starting point.>/[hero2.face:skeptical]That is a good example of healthy intentions \nI can only imagine bearing shriveled fruit./These are not questions you may borrow anyone's answers to. Except, I will say... \n[i]death[] is not what brings you to Nitherfaruwen. Or, I mean, it is not [i]merely[] death./[hero2.face:interested][i]Elsewhere[] is an illusion-word, used to make [i]somewhere[] feel like home./How perilous it is to believe. Even to believe in real things. Perhaps we come to see that, or perhaps we forever did. But it never stops us. There [i]is[] sweetness... [i]so[] worth tasting./There can be no community where there is not common interest.\n<hero2.loner/80:You will find that/So it exists> almost exclusively in the citadel. And it [i]is[] there.>
