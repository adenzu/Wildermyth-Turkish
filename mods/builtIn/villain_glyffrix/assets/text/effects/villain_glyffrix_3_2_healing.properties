~01~~panel_142~3_speech=Anyway, we are coming to the piece of this tale I first teased. Of the goddess and me. Of [i]Oruwe.[] And me.
~01~~panel_143~1_darken=Oruwe, you should understand, \n    is a very old Thing.
~01~~panel_143~2_darken=Older, the dragon has said, than the egg; older  \n     than prespeech, which means all those emergent concepts \n        that could form before language was made.
~01~~panel_143~3_darken=She is older than all you call god.
~01~~panel_144~1_darken=In the early long moments of existence,\n   she was one fiber of purpose in   \n       the wiry tangle all unmattering.
~01~~panel_145~1_darken=When shapes were had,\n    hers was one of the first.
~01~~panel_145~2_darken=Like most ancient beings, she\n    lived full of wonder. And like most of us, \n          age uncounted, wonder led her to dream.
~01~~panel_146~1_darken=Out of her dreaming came \n      this place, Nitherfaruwen.
~01~~panel_146~2_darken=I don't know why.
~01~~panel_146~3_darken=It [i]belonged[] to her in some sense.\nAnd in another sense, did not.
~01~~panel_147~1_darken=When a dragon, weary of its world\n     and whiningly bored,\n         dug down to the deepbelow, to Nitherfaruwen,\n             immediately, then, Oruwe was deposed.
~01~~panel_147~2_darken=So the twilight dragon began to rule here.  \n    And [i]has[] ever since.
