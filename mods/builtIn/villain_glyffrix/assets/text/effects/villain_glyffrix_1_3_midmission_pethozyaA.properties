~01~~panel_001~1_narration=Stiff quiet.
~01~~panel_003~3_target2=[i]Hold[] for a moment. You all may\nhave misjudged something.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=The hall smells of wet stone, wool, wood, and paper. \nAstringent fumes every so often leak across the nose.
~01~~panel_004~4_target2=[small]Yes. These veins... run [i]deep.[]
~01~~panel_005~3_target2=This is not a hidehouse. \nThis is a [i]fortress.[]
~01~~panel_006~2_hero=[small]But it's weirdly almost... [i]homey.[]
~01~~panel_006~3_target2=[small][i]Mmp.[] Yes, exactly.
~01~~panel_006~4_hero2=So we should go slower?
~01~~panel_007~5_hero2=Then, if we're taking a breath, I can ask, maybe... \nthis thing you're hunting. It's morthagi? Or what?
~01~~panel_008~3_target2=Just swallowing a burp!
~01~~panel_008~4_hero=Exactly it's [i]homey,[] or exactly we...?
~01~~panel_009~4_target=Leegan Longblade. Leegan the Liverthief. As a man, he was our Emperor's friend. \nAnd most skilled assassin. Stories say you would not know them from brothers.
~01~~panel_010~5_target2=Death is what I call a [i]classroom word.[]
~01~~panel_011~4_target=They claim Leegan would have embraced death, \neven to save the Emperor a shallow wound.
~01~~panel_011~7_hero=And... [small]he didn't embrace it, I guess?
~01~~panel_012~5_target2=It is inert. It produces no action in us, it conjures only a cozy kind of dread. An indoor dread.
~01~~panel_013~5_target2=[i]Survival[] is the useful word. [i]Survival[] is the [i]catalyzer![] You would be startled what limits you might easily cross, once you see before you a way to [i]survive.[] And maybe I do you too little credit, but... have you ever been [i]personally[] offered immortality?
~01~~panel_014~2_hero=Which means [i]what,[] though?\nWhere do you go for [i]immortality?[]
~01~~panel_014~6_target2=They called themselves the [i]Enduring.[] People \nwho fused their personalities into Morthagi.
~01~~panel_015~7_target=An eternally smoldering human [i]coal.[] Kept, cradled in a cage of bone and metal, whole or shrivelled as it might be.
~01~~panel_016~7_target=Those are the Deathless.
~01~~panel_017~6_target2=[i]Deathless[] is a word we use that is a, [i]yes,[]\nperhaps, a [i]petulant[] refusal of their term.
~01~~panel_018~6_target2=We [i]do[] remain so alike to children, \nhowever old we begin to look.
~01~~panel_019~2_hero=If they [i]were[] human... [small]I don't fully understand why...
~01~~panel_019~7_hero3=[small]Some of us more than others.
~01~~panel_019~8_target2=Ha!
~01~~panel_020~10_hero2=Right, why is there so much...\nI guess the word is [i]enmity?
~01~~panel_020~9_target2=Ah.
~01~~panel_021~6_target2=Well, the first of them were not murderers.\nThey were scholars. Unlawful, but their ambition, I think, was genuinely wholesome.
~01~~panel_022~4_target=Those first ones, the gentle ones... they were hunted into hiding. Instead it was \nthose who hunted them... those like [i]Leegan...[] who have brought Pethozya to ruin.
~01~~panel_023~7_target2=Mm. The [i]hunters[] came into possession of the tools and facilities of these academics. And likely offered clemency to a few among their quarry who might aid them.
~01~~panel_023~8_target=And shed whatever humanity they ever had. Leegan, and those beside him.
~01~~panel_024~4_target=He slew his old friend, himself. \nAlong with the emperor's line.
~01~~panel_024~5_action=[cherry]slek!
~01~~panel_025~4_target=And, yes, I know there are better minds than Leegan's that now...\nor, perhaps even [i]then,[] they held his leash. But in any case...
~01~~panel_026~4_target=In any case, that is the war.
~01~~panel_026~6_target2=[small]See, <target.mf:he gets/she gets/they get> all [i]these[] facts correct.
~01~~panel_027~5_target2=<target> knows all about Leegan and the dissolution of the empire of Pethozya. I was quite impressed, when first <target.mf:he/she/they> petitioned me for help.
~01~~panel_028~7_target=I studied every account I could [i]find.[]\n[small]Every journal, every article. Every [i]corpse.
~01~~panel_029~6_target2=I became less impressed when I \nrealized it is [i]all[] <target.mf:he knows/she knows/they know>.
~01~~panel_029~7_hero3=It's not that strange to be single-minded.\nIt seems [i]personal[] for <target.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~~panel_030~7_target=Leegan is the one thing in this world I [i]must[] erase. I seek nothing but his [i]end.[]
~01~~panel_032~10_target2=I am afraid <target.mf:he is/she is/they are> quite serious. \nWhat can an old <target2.mf:man/woman/teacher> do?
~01~~panel_033~11_hero2=You either stop <target.mf:him/her/them>. Or you help <target.mf:him/her/them>. \n[small]And see what kind of person <target.mf:he is/she is/they are> after...
