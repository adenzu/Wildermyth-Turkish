~01~~panel_001~1_speech=Hey. [i]Voice?[]
~01~~panel_001~3_narration=Elthiar, that surefooted Lostling, \n  treads in a musty dream.
~01~~panel_002~4_narration=She is snared in things once hers.
~01~~panel_002~5_narration=A molded-through memory of the world.
~01~~panel_003~1_speech=Neither of us belongs here.
~01~~panel_004~1_speech=Interesting.
~01~~panel_004~2_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]        That is certainly true of you.\n\nBut you will stay until I am done.
~01~~panel_005~1_speech=That doesn't [i]sound[] like me.
~01~~panel_006~3_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]    For an all-considering creature, \n          the mind makes the best prison.
~01~~panel_007~1_speech=Is that so? Well, can we leave out the decorations?\nThese memories are too old to mean anything.
~01~~panel_007~2_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]Blame yourself, Orufel. You brought them with you.
~01~~panel_008~1_speech=Did I? [i]Bring[] them?
~01~~panel_009~1_speech=Then you are implying that I now [i]visit[] a mind not my own. \n[i]Yours,[] right? Am I locked inside of you?
~01~~panel_010~1_speech=Silence means yes.
~01~~panel_012~1_speech=Yes, I am onto you now. I play this game myself.
~01~~panel_013~1_speech=You [i]like[] me discovering you. Bit by bit. You want me to pick out and admire each particular flavor of this dish you have toiled to prepare for me.
~01~~panel_013~2_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]You think I am playing coy?
~01~~panel_014~1_speech=Mm.
~01~~panel_014~2_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]Perhaps I am. There is delight \n  in this. A feeling I did not expect.
~01~~panel_015~1_speech=At least it explains the great tree growing out there. \n[i]That[] is not mine. [i]I[] have never been so in love as that.
~01~~panel_016~2_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Do you see it?
~01~~panel_017~2_speech=[light]You [i]could[] have \n    hidden it from me.
~01~~panel_018~2_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]I did not anticipate...
~01~~panel_018~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]...that your gaze might focus so \n        far beyond your own circumstance.
~01~~panel_019~2_speech=[light]Yes. How unpredictable.
~01~~panel_019~3_speech=[light]Though I will say...\n    it [i]is[] an impressive tree.
~01~~panel_020~1_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]It is for her.
~01~~panel_021~1_speech=[light]Her?
~01~~panel_022~3_speech=[ui][darkGreen][i]Who once ruled, here.
