~01~~panel_001~3_speech=<hero.eLove:[hero.face:happy]/>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=A castle is then there.
~01~~panel_002~4_hero2=<hero2.bookish/goofball/greedy/loner/poet/romantic/snark/80:Our view of it... I'm sure it's warped, hm?\nThe distance isn't calculable [i]distance?/[i]Someone[] was having fun./Now [i]that's[] a real... a [i]real[] palace. [small]Isn't it?//Can such a thing [i]be?[]/It's somehow more fanciful than I'd imagined./[i]There's[] a real humble house./Must be where we're going<hero.coward/healer/hothead/leader:?/?/./.>>
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Through a window in the rocks they see its spires twisting.
~01~~panel_003~4_hero2=<hero2.bookish/goofball/greedy/loner/poet/romantic/snark/80:That being said. What kind of [i]dimensions[] can I imagine?/[i]Right?[] What a [i]house.[]/What must it be like inside? Will we [i]see[] it?/It looks [i]big.[] Too big to live inside./Is there any other landscape that would tolerate it? \n[small]Maybe that's the better question. Can our [i]eyes[] tolerate it?/And we'll dance inside its halls?/That's where we're going?/Or [i]isn't[] it?>
~01~~panel_004~2_speech=<hero2.bookish/goofball/greedy/loner/poet/romantic/snark/80:You brave dangers, you behold wonders./Dragons [i]adore[] excess./You were [i]invited,[] after all./But many do./You brave dangers, you behold wonders./You will at least [i]visit[]./Dragons [i]adore[] excess./Dragons [i]adore[] excess.>

~01~~panel_007~1_narration=At the next glance, it's gone. Replaced by mute horizon.
~01~~panel_007~5_hero3=It [i]is...[] predictably... impressive.
~01~~panel_007~6_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~~panel_008~2_speech=Yes. It grows and grows. Less and less\ndoes old Glyffrix ever leave it.
~01~~panel_008~6_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:neutral]/[face:grim]/[face:interested]>

~01~~panel_010~8_hero=<hero.elthiarLike:[face:talking]I knew it when I [i]saw[] you, Elthiar. Somehow, I \nthink I at [i]least[] knew... I'd trust you to the end.[hero2.face:grim]/<hero.bookish/hothead/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:I had a [i]reason[] for my reluctance, when we set out. Reluctance to trust you, I mean.

But I'm done doubting you, now./The way I thought I really [i]shouldn't[face:neutral]...[]\nI at [i]least...[] [small]believe it now./I don't feel like I was [i]wrong[] to doubt. Back at the start. But. My doubting's done. \n/The way I was maybe afraid to...\nI at [i]least...[] [small]believe it now. >>
~01~~panel_011~6_hero2=It's been a little bit of a walk.\nBut[i] yeah.[] I believe it, too.
~01~~panel_011~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:skeptical]/[face:neutral]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~~panel_012~4_hero2=We'll get there.
~01~~panel_013~2_speech=I don't mind a little walk from here,\nand a little walk back. I am not worried.
~01~~panel_014~7_speech=[darkBlue]We don't need to charm \n  each other, my dear.
~01~~panel_015~7_speech=[darkBlue]You know better than most: there's \n   deeper than darkness in this realm I rule.
~01~~panel_016~7_speech=[darkBlue]Perhaps you didn't realize your road goes through it?
~01~~panel_017~2_speech=[i]"And each star would flee seeing, a free windborne kite,  \nbut is bound to the ballast of the world of unlight."[]
~01~~panel_018~2_speech=That is Nitherfaruwen. I read this proposed cosmology, that \ncreation balances around this world, this little black weight. \nAnd so holds together, straining to keep us afloat.
~01~~panel_019~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]/[face:neutral]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_020~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]/[face:happy]>
~01~~panel_020~8_hero=[small][i]What?
~01~~panel_020~9_hero3=Hm.
~01~~panel_021~2_speech=Nothing. [small]Just...[] I [i]should[] have been less confident. About the danger you would face. My own talent, my ability to ward your steps.
~01~~panel_021~6_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]>
~01~~panel_022~2_speech=But as I once told you, I had made certainty my way. \nI am in [i]no[] way certain what lies ahead, here and after.
~01~~panel_022~7_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]/[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_023~3_hero2=That last one. The [i]aumary.[]
~01~~panel_024~3_hero2=Suddenly, we were in the trees. And surrounded by wildfire. \nIt just hit us out of nowhere, this time. Like a night rain.
~01~~panel_025~2_speech=Yes. And I saw no sign, or way to prevent it.
~01~~panel_025~8_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]/[face:talking]>So we can expect it will keep happening.
~01~~panel_026~2_speech=[i]Maybe.[] I feel... that the Goddess's great thoughts... \n      have been stirred.
~01~~panel_026~8_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_027~2_speech=Did I say it well? Did I hook you?
~01~~panel_027~9_hero4=The [i]Goddess?[]<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_028~2_speech=When I have had some steps to remember,\nI will tell you about me and her.
~01~~panel_028~9_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_029~10_hero3=Your [i]bow,[] anyway... is strong. Your aim is good.
~01~~panel_029~11_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_030~11_hero3=You fight well for us.
~01~~panel_030~12_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:happy]/[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]>
~01~~panel_031~1_narration=They travel the land in front of them. \n    Fog capes the crags of this black nameless shire.
