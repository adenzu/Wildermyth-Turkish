~01~~panel_015~1_narration=Then things change.
~01~~panel_017~2_narration=...as unbelonging colors pool up from every shadow.
~01~~panel_017~6_hero3=[small]Um, I think...
~01~~panel_018~1_narration=Warm air lands on <hero>'s neck...
~01~~panel_019~6_action=[purple]gout!
~01~~panel_019~7_hero3=<hero2>?!
~01~~panel_020~8_hero2=Think we're... [small]coming back.
~01~~panel_021~7_hero3=I... [small]yeah...
~01~~panel_022~2_narration=The wind mewls. It paws their clothes.
~01~~panel_023~8_hero=[small]Hm.
~01~~panel_024~8_hero=<hero.greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:talking]<hero2>, I'm going to say something, and you're forbidden from coming to any conclusions about it./[face:skeptical]Hey.

~01~~panel_026~12_hero4=Applause. [i]Applause,[] you kids.
~01~~panel_027~13_hero=Oh...!
~01~~panel_028~11_hero4=I applaud your squirrelishness. \nYour secretkeeping.
~01~~panel_030~11_hero4=It is quite the [i]reveal.[] \nWould you not say so?
~01~~panel_031~11_hero4=But, [i]now...[] that you have finally spit this rather outsized \npuzzlepiece into my fingers... things at [i]last[] make sense.
~01~~panel_031~13_hero2=They [i]do?[]
~01~~panel_032~14_hero=They [i]shouldn't,[] should they?
~01~~panel_032~15_hero2=[small]To <hero4.mf:him/her/a...>?
~01~~panel_032~16_hero3=No.
~01~~panel_033~16_hero4=So we have acrossed realities.
~01~~panel_034~16_hero4=[small]Well, [i]yes,[] obviously.
~01~~panel_034~17_hero2=I guess you expected [i]something,[] didn't you?
~01~~panel_035~16_hero4=You [i]were[] wearing my world rather backwards, so I feel you ought to understand my susp... [small]hm.[] But. [i]Now[] I am remembering. The whole...
~01~~panel_036~16_hero4=...rest of my life.
~01~~panel_037~1_narration=There are only unknowns.
~01~~panel_038~1_narration=They are shared over soup, and chewed on \nfor whatever truth might be in them.
~01~~panel_039~11_hero4=[light]...and always, I do manage... just by the hairs in my ears... \nto kill that lonely old creature in his cold black lair. I do it alone,\n           and wake poor <npc> to admire my deathcraft.
~01~~panel_040~2_npc=<hero4.mf:Lord/Lady/Master> <hero4>...
~01~~panel_040~3_hero4=Do you think your <npc.mf:brother/sister/brother> will rest easier, now?
~01~~panel_042~14_hero4=And after that, <npc.mf:he is/she is/<npc> is> mine.<npc.mf: <npc>./ <npc>./>
~01~~panel_042~15_hero3=[small][i]Yours.[]
~01~~panel_042~16_hero2=[small]<hero4.mf:He only means/She only means/They only mean>... mm.
~01~~panel_043~14_hero4=And together we wander. Off the ends of our maps. We track down the Deathless. It becomes our work.
~01~~panel_044~14_hero4=<npc.mf:He ends/She ends/They end> up surpassing me. And we do our damage. \nUntil the war gets <npc.mf:him/her/them>. Gets me [i]too,[] not long after.
~01~~panel_045~14_hero4=It happens like that. Or it would. If I were not now living that one moment. Over and over. In apparent perpetuity.
~01~~panel_046~16_hero4=So I must be very lucky.
~01~~panel_047~1_narration=The old Pethozyan marvels to hear Netherflare named.
~01~~panel_047~2_narration=And all the particulars \nof their journey.
~01~~panel_048~1_narration=<hero> forages while the others scrape \nbedplaces into the tender black loam.
~01~~panel_048~2_narration=There's something bothering <hero.mf:him/her/them> that <hero.mf:he/she/they> can't quite identify.
~01~~panel_049~14_hero4=...to place before [i]steely[] Dragonpaws... our favorite questions... and hear of creation's cradlenights...
~01~~panel_050~2_narration=The damp smell, maybe.
~01~~panel_051~2_narration=In the springtime, from ages six to sixteen, <hero.mf:he and his/she and her/they and their> mother \nused to go find early dragonflies. Down by the valley water.
~01~~panel_051~3_narration=The memory leaves <hero.mf:him/her/them> cold. It feels foreign, like fiction, though \n<hero.mf:he knows/she knows/they know> it's not. It could almost belong to someone else.
~01~~panel_052~12_hero4=But we still need [i]this[] <hero.mf:boy's/girl's/child's> blessing.
~01~~panel_053~14_hero2=<hero4>'s coming with us, too, <hero4.mf:he/she/they> said.
~01~~panel_054~13_hero=Oh.
~01~~panel_055~16_hero=No, yeah, I figured <hero4.mf:he/she/they> would. \nAnd it makes as much sense as...
~01~~panel_056~16_hero=...any of this.
~01~~panel_058~1_narration=Sleep is a blur of black and blinking violet.
~01~~panel_059~1_narration=But they wake. And walk off together.
~01~~panel_060~15_hero4=Hey. <hero.whm:Young fighter with the farcasting eyes./You. Horizoner. Young light-in-<hero.mf:his/her/their>-eyes./Youth is like a phosphor to darkening eyes. So.> \nIlluminate this character for me: [i]Elthiar.[]
~01~~panel_060~16_hero=[i]Me[]?
~01~~panel_061~15_hero=[i]Why?[]
~01~~panel_061~16_hero4=Because.
~01~~panel_063~15_hero=Well. I don't know what there... [i]really[] is to say. I wish \nI knew her. I wish I knew what about her was true.
~01~~panel_063~16_hero4=Those sound like strong feelings.
~01~~panel_064~15_hero=[i]Huh?[] No, it's not like...
~01~~panel_065~18_hero=[small]It's not like I seriously [i]wish...[] no. No, it's \njust a. I don't know. It [i]annoys[] me.
~01~~panel_066~19_hero3=Yeah, whatever it is, <hero> doesn't like her. Their former guide. [i]Elthiar.[]
~01~~panel_066~20_hero2=[small]Well. <hero3>.
~01~~panel_066~21_hero4=[small]You think so?
~01~~panel_067~20_hero2=Something tells me there's... more to it. I just don't know exactly [i]what.[]
~01~~panel_067~21_hero3=Hm?
~01~~panel_068~19_hero3=Huh. [i][small]Really?
~01~~panel_068~20_hero=[small]What?
~01~~panel_069~21_hero=What'd <hero2.mf:he/she/they> [i]say?[]
~01~~panel_069~22_hero3=Don't worry about it.
~01~~panel_071~23_hero4=What I used to tell <npc>, that <npc.mf:he/she/they> only \n[i]maybe[] could grasp later in <npc.mf:his/her/their> life...
~01~~panel_072~23_hero4=...was this. That there is no \nunderstanding another.
~01~~panel_073~23_hero4=When you accept that, you see that the humbler, the \n[i]fitter[] objective--more fit, I am saying--is to like them.
~01~~panel_075~23_hero4=Yes, and thank all gods!
~01~~panel_075~25_hero=I'm not <npc>.
~01~~panel_076~23_hero4=That is why you fill me with hope.
~01~~panel_078~26_hero=At least I can rely on <hero2>...
~01~~panel_079~1_narration=Later.
~01~~panel_079~23_hero2=Well.
~01~~panel_079~24_hero=[small][i]What?[] No...
~01~~panel_080~1_narration=After a wearying march, they arrive there.
~01~~panel_080~24_hero=<hero2>, did we just...!?
~01~~panel_081~2_narration=The place <hero2>'s been hoping for in <hero2.mf:his/her/their> heart.
~01~~panel_082~25_hero2=[small]Whoops?
