Now I guess their [i]leader...[] has finally waded into the trees <hero.mf:himself/herself/herself>. Beside a great salty [i]serpent of song/our... [i]The Bone Imperator.[] Some great and hundred-limbed... a Morthagi-thing, if you know what that is>...
~01~~panel_084~7_hero2=<hero.whm:The [i]Grimlord[] Gyezdac. For/Finally comes ashore, mm. We've been fighting <hero.mf:him/her/her>/Been fighting Morthagi> all my life, it feels like.
~01~~panel_085~7_hero2=I used to be on that team. The one that went. That far-going team. \nBut not this time. This time I'm a window-watcher. A doorguard.
~01~~panel_086~3_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Two of you. Is not so many.
~01~~panel_087~7_hero2=The others'll return. I'm not telling you [i]everything.[] \nBut let's leave it here: they're not with us [i]tonight.[]
~01~~panel_088~3_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Such schemes don't spring from a tired head like mine, be easy.
~01~~panel_088~7_hero2=In any case the militia alone are enough to fend off [i]your[] band. \nAnd I doubt you could bring a larger force to bear, unnoticed.
~01~~panel_089~1_narration=The Gworl who led them now stills.
~01~~panel_089~2_narration=Its flat black stare feels out their faces.
~01~~panel_089~3_narration=But their eyes are turned doomwards.
~01~~panel_090~1_narration=To the door.
~01~~panel_090~2_narration=The Umbral Door.
~01~~panel_090~3_narration=Up close, its will seems to radiate:
~01~~panel_091~1_narration=[header][white]Look upon me.
~01~~panel_092~3_narration=The walls behind it shimmer. Grafted night.
~01~~panel_093~1_narration=The Great Umbral Door.
~01~~panel_093~3_narration=Gives off the ghost of a hum. Tunelessly familiar, \nlike wind in the teeth of old farm walls.
~01~~panel_094~7_hero=[small]<hero2>?
~01~~panel_094~8_hero2=[small]Hm?
~01~~panel_095~3_hero=My legs suddenly don't want to move.
~01~~panel_096~3_hero2=<hero2.personality2:[face:neutral]Remember what you told [i]me:[] here's a chance\nto learn what we'd never otherwise know./[face:interested]You did tell me you were sure. \n/[face:interested]Oh? Well. It'll [i]probably[] be okay?/[face:skeptical]This's what [i]you[] wanted, remember?\nI [i]said[] it was too big a risk./[face:neutral]It's alright to feel fear. Don't hold onto it, or \ncomplicate it. Just let it roll through you. /[face:skeptical]Hm? You're [i]scared?[] What's the big [i]door[] going to do?/[face:neutral]Wars and mountains. Spirits and monsters. Things I didn't know to expect. I've always found my way home. You will, too./Hm. Well. Try to [i]convince[] them.[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]I've wandered many mapless places. Faced \nterrible things. I've always returned home./It doesn't become a story if you \ncan't keep walking forward.[face:happy]/Just a big fancy gate, <hero>. Don't talk\nyourself [i]out[] of it...[small] after talking me [i]in.[][face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_097~1_narration=There's no announcement but the groan of barely budging rock.
~01~~panel_097~2_action=[darkGray][actionSmall]...nnnggg...
~01~~panel_097~3_action=[gray][actionSmall]...nnnggg...
~01~~panel_097~4_action=[purple][actionSmall]...nnnggg...
~01~~panel_098~1_narration=Then the sudden lack of any noise at all, \nas if the door holds its breath.
~01~~panel_098~2_narration=Finally, a filament of light...
~01~~panel_099~1_narration=...becomes a moonray...
~01~~panel_099~2_narration=...becomes a whitening surge.
~01~~panel_100~2_narration=And it could've been a blink, it could've been an hour.
~01~~panel_100~3_narration=Where stood a grand forbidding door...
~01~~panel_101~1_narration=...now spans a brilliant blank.
~01~~panel_101~2_narration=One figure floats in the milky ether.
~01~~panel_101~3_narration=Liquid and strange, fragrant as a field of foreign flowers.
~01~~panel_102~2_narration=Drifts to them with the calm of a feather on slow currents.
~01~~panel_103~6_speech=[darkGreen][actionSmall]Stop spewing, you old spoil-baron! Or leave the cave!
~01~~panel_104~4_speech=[brown][actionSmall]That's Elthiar!
~01~~panel_105~11_speech=I bring you a glittering welcome, human heroes.\nThe only kind Glyffrix would have me extend.
~01~~panel_105~3_narration=Voice low and careful. Giving the impression \nit will carry just as far as it's meant to.
~01~~panel_107~11_speech=I [i]am[] Elthiar, yes. From across all \nNitherfaruwen, I am come to collect you.
~01~~panel_108~12_hero=[small]Wow.
~01~~panel_108~13_hero2=[small]Hm.
~01~~panel_109~11_speech=However...
~01~~panel_110~11_speech=...is it only the [i]pair[] of you?
~01~~panel_111~12_hero=[small]Only the...?
~01~~panel_111~13_hero2=[small]Well, because...[face:skeptical]
~01~~panel_112~1_narration=A marrow-loosening hornblast...!
~01~~panel_112~9_action=[aqua][actionLarge]kree-OOOOORRRGH!!
~01~~panel_113~1_narration=...rips their attention back into the dark...!
~01~~panel_113~2_narration=...as Deepists boil up from every crevice!

~01~~panel_114~3_speech=[brown][actionSmall]They'll KILL us...!!
~01~~panel_114~5_speech=[darkGreen][actionSmall]They're not our guys!!
~01~~panel_115~5_action=[aqua][actionLarge]CrAsHhHhH!!

~01~~panel_117~12_hero=They're trying to get [i]through?[]
~01~~panel_118~13_hero2=Is it [i]bad[] if they pass the door?
~01~~panel_119~9_speech=Is it [i]bad?[]
~01~~panel_120~12_hero=The Gworls are [i]fighting.[]
~01~~panel_120~14_hero2=It's a battle, <hero>. A real battle. Stay close.
~01~~panel_121~6_speech=[aqua]Fearless are we who walk unsleeping!! Forth, we all, \nand over their bones!! To our immortal reward!!
