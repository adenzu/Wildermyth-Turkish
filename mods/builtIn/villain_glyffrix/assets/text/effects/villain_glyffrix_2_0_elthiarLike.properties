~01~~panel_032~2_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]I have no intention of releasing you.
~01~~panel_033~1_speech=You have no [i]intention,[] I know that.
~01~~panel_034~1_speech=But that only means you are out of ideas. You are unsure how to [i]use[] me. Right? After all the effort it took to trap me, that seems a shame.
~01~~panel_035~3_action=[darkGray]...crk...
~01~~panel_035~4_action=[darkAqua]...crk...
~01~~panel_036~1_speech=[i]I[] have ideas.
~01~~panel_037~5_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_037~6_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_038~1_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Deal?
~01~~panel_039~1_speech=A [i]deal,[] I am saying. At great [i]pains,[] I will offer my hand.
~01~~panel_040~1_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]A promise? Between [b]us?[]
~01~~panel_040~2_speech=Mm.
~01~~panel_041~1_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]You would not honor it.
~01~~panel_041~2_speech=[small]What?
~01~~panel_042~2_speech=I would have no [i]choice.[]
~01~~panel_043~1_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_043~2_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_043~3_speech=But... did you... [small]really not [i]know?[]
~01~~panel_044~2_speech=How interesting. Ah, how almost [i]saddening![] I am disappointed in you, Theevaleen, for [i]her[] sake.
~01~~panel_045~1_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]I [b]forbid[] you from using that name.
~01~~panel_045~2_speech=You ought not to have left it lying around, then.
~01~~panel_046~2_speech=And, anyway, you did it first.\n[i]No one[] calls me Orufel, anymore.
~01~~panel_047~1_speech=But let us not squabble at the table. Where your knowledge lacks, I shall graciously fill in. You see, by her nature, or by her will, or by whatever we might suppose governs how she [i]is[] and [i]does...[]
~01~~panel_048~1_speech=...a deal is sacred to her. A promise. One's formal guarantee.
~01~~panel_049~1_speech=Your Goddess, Oruwe--whom you would attest you [i]love[]--sang and hammered such a world into being: Nitherfaruwen, where oaths are kept. And [i]must[] be. Even Glyffrix cannot sunder vows.
~01~~panel_050~1_speech=Not without some grave consequences.
~01~~panel_051~1_speech=Take it from one who promised her all, and cheated her.\nYou claim knowledge of [i]that[] story, at least.
~01~~panel_051~4_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_051~5_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_052~1_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Then... what.
~01~~panel_053~2_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i][b]What.
~01~~panel_054~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]What are you offering?
~01~~panel_055~2_speech=[light]There [i]is[] a thing you need.
~01~~panel_056~1_speech=Something you have labored, fruitlessly, to acquire?\n[i]I[] can give it to you. And you know I have the power.
~01~~panel_056~4_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_056~5_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_057~2_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]I did not look for such an easy answer.
~01~~panel_058~1_speech=Of course not, you are young to your feelings. \nYou think loyalty is everything. I will tell you...
~01~~panel_059~1_speech=...Glyffrix may be my last and longest friend...
~01~~panel_060~1_speech=...but for my freedom?
~01~~panel_061~2_speech=[light][large]...I would even see the dragon dead.
