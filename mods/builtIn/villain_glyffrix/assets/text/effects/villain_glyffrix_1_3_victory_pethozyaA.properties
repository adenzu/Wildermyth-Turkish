~01~~panel_003~3_hero2=An end, maybe.
~01~~panel_003~5_hero=[small]It's the end of this... [i]Leegan.[]

~01~~panel_015~8_hero2=Think we're... [small]coming back.
~01~~panel_016~5_hero4=[small]The sky...!
~01~~panel_016~6_hero2=The sky's alright.
~01~~panel_016~9_hero3=[small]Hm.
~01~~panel_017~2_narration=The wind mewls. It paws their clothes.
~01~~panel_018~8_hero=[small]Hm.
~01~~panel_019~8_hero=<hero.greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:talking]<hero2>, I'm going to say something, and you're forbidden from coming to any conclusions about it./[face:skeptical]Hey.

~01~~panel_020~10_hero4=[small]Um.
~01~~panel_020~9_hero=Returning [i]here.[] The light. The air. The smell and <hero.bookish/coward/poet/60:sensation have grown rapidly familiar. I [i]relaxed,[] just now.

~01~~panel_022~10_hero2=<hero2.coward/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Right.[] Um... hey./Oh. Right. The funky part?[face:interested]/Yeah? Yeah.

~01~~panel_024~8_hero4=Hm?
~01~~panel_025~10_hero2=It was all a memory of yours.<hero2.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark/80: Or, that's the prevailing theory.[face:talking] A suspension of reality./[small]\nOr.

~01~~panel_025~8_hero4=What was a what?

~01~~panel_026~11_hero3=You've lived it again and again.\n[i]Haven't[] you? That memory.
~01~~panel_026~8_hero4=[small]Ah.
~01~~panel_027~8_hero4=That memory?
~01~~panel_028~5_hero4=No. I have not?
~01~~panel_029~10_hero3=What?
~01~~panel_029~11_hero2=What do you [i]mean?[]
~01~~panel_029~8_hero4=Or not quite. Not exactly.
~01~~panel_030~8_hero4=I mean I... never actually got to [i]kill[] him.
~01~~panel_031~1_narration=There are only unknowns.
~01~~panel_032~1_narration=But they are shared out soberly.
~01~~panel_032~2_narration=Chewed on for whatever truth  \n     might be in them.
~01~~panel_033~11_hero4=[light]...it is always [i]me[] who\n   pulls the switch...
~01~~panel_034~14_hero4=...and I drift rather thoughtlessly,\nin an... ethereal place, until...
~01~~panel_035~21_hero4=[small][light]Nguh?
~01~~panel_039~14_hero4=It happens like that. Each time. The incredible [i]idiot.
~01~~panel_040~13_hero2=Maybe, if... [small]just our [i]being[] there caused  \nold <npc> to make a different choice?
~01~~panel_040~15_hero3=Leegan does [i]die?[]
~01~~panel_040~3_hero=[small]But the [i]result[] \nstayed the same?
~01~~panel_041~14_hero4=Hm? Oh. [small]Yes.
~01~~panel_042~14_hero4=Yes, <npc.mf:<npc>/she/<npc>> leads me to stare upon Leegan's twisted remains. [small]And I always feel...
~01~~panel_043~14_hero4=Mm. But he has never died by my hand. Or even by the \n[i]help[] of my hand, never... before [i]this.[] Now.
~01~~panel_044~1_narration=<hero> forages while the others scrape \nbedplaces into the tender black loam.
~01~~panel_044~2_narration=There's something bothering <hero.mf:him/her/them> that <hero.mf:he/she/they> can't quite identify.
~01~~panel_045~11_hero3=...which is why I... well. I don't know if it's [i]why,[] but I went with them. And so far... I don't [i]think[] my choice was wrong.
~01~~panel_045~13_hero2=[small]In fact, I'm pretty sure it was [i]right.[]
~01~~panel_046~2_narration=The damp smell, maybe.
~01~~panel_047~2_narration=In the springtime, from ages six to sixteen, <hero.mf:he and his/she and her/they and their> mother \nused to go find early dragonflies. Down by the valley water.
~01~~panel_047~3_narration=The memory leaves <hero.mf:him/her/them> cold. It feels foreign, like fiction, though \n<hero.mf:he knows/she knows/they know> it's not. It could almost belong to someone else.
~01~~panel_048~12_hero4=And your story is that you are a wolf who never got to use <hero.mf:his/her/their> fangs?
~01~~panel_048~13_hero=[small][i]Mine[] is?
~01~~panel_049~14_hero2=<hero4> is coming with us, too, <hero4.mf:he/she/they> said.
~01~~panel_049~15_hero4=[small]I asked [i]permission[] to.
~01~~panel_050~13_hero=Hm.
~01~~panel_051~15_hero4=And only after being persuaded.
~01~~panel_052~16_hero=You don't have to explain. I think it makes... yeah. \nMore sense than... yeah. So.
~01~~panel_053~1_narration=Sleep is a blur of black and blinking violet.
~01~~panel_054~1_narration=But they wake. And walk off together.
~01~~panel_055~14_hero=I'd like to be able to trust someone like that.
~01~~panel_055~15_hero4=Hm?
~01~~panel_056~15_hero=Like [i]you.[] Seems like you trusted that old <npc.mf:man/woman/goofball> to... \nwell, basically to the limits of what I'd call trust.
~01~~panel_056~16_hero4=[small]<npc.mf:Lord/Lady/Master> <npc>?
~01~~panel_057~15_hero=I mean, you let <npc.mf:him/her/them> exact vengeance in your place. Against your <hero4.mf:brother's/sister's/brother's> [i]murderer?[] Wasn't that the.... I mean, it probably meant a [i]lot[] to you?
~01~~panel_057~16_hero4=I did not do it [i]happily.[]
~01~~panel_058~15_hero=Not happily, maybe, but [i]still.[]
~01~~panel_058~17_hero4=[small]Mm.
~01~~panel_059~18_hero=[small][i]Still.[] I have a hard time imagining that.
~01~~panel_059~19_hero4=[small]I was really [i]focused,[] back then.
~01~~panel_060~19_hero3=What about you and <hero2>? If anything,\nthey reminded me of [i]you guys.[]
~01~~panel_060~20_hero2=[small]Tch!
~01~~panel_061.(hero_is_male)~6_hero2=[face:dubious]Every time I so much as said three words to one of <hero.mf:his/her/<hero>'s> parents, <hero.mf:he'd/she'd/there'd follow the immediate> demand I <hero.mf:tell him/tell her/spill> everything. Like I was secretly set on undermining <hero.mf:him/her/them> to <hero.mf:his/her/their> mother.
~01~~panel_062.(hero_is_female)~6_hero2=[face:dubious]Every time I so much as said three words to one of <hero.mf:his/her/<hero>'s> parents, <hero.mf:he'd/she'd/there'd follow the immediate> demand I <hero.mf:tell him/tell her/spill> everything. Like I was secretly set on undermining <hero.mf:him/her/them> to <hero.mf:his/her/their> mother.
~01~~panel_063.(hero_is_gender-neutral)~6_hero2=[face:dubious]Every time I so much as said three words to one of <hero.mf:his/her/<hero>'s> parents, <hero.mf:he'd/she'd/there'd follow the immediate> demand that I <hero.mf:tell him/tell her/spill> everything. Like I was secretly set on undermining <hero.mf:him/her/them> to <hero.mf:his/her/their> mother.
~01~~panel_064~19_hero3=I...[small] see...
~01~~panel_064~20_hero=[small]Hm?
~01~~panel_065~21_hero=What'd <hero2.mf:he/she/they> say?
~01~~panel_065~22_hero3=Don't worry about it.
~01~~panel_067~23_hero4=Trust is not so simple a thing.
~01~~panel_068~23_hero4=It is not a [i]crown,[] given whole and at once. \nNor is it easy to take [i]back,[] in total.
~01~~panel_069~23_hero4=Think of it as... maybe as a precious elixir. Or a bitter [i]soup.[] You offer it, sip by sip, to one who shows the capacity to keep it down.
~01~~panel_070~23_hero4=I trust you with [i]this[] thing. I trust you with [i]that[] \nthing. Like that. In these apportioned mouthfuls.\nIt grows. Or. [i]Accrues,[] I should maybe say.
~01~~panel_071~23_hero4=Actually, no, not really.
~01~~panel_071~25_hero=Is that true?
~01~~panel_072~23_hero4=No. Because, for instance, I would not have trusted <npc.mf:Lord/Lady/Master> <npc> to lead us [i]straight.[] In this case. The way you have trusted <hero2>. So trust does not really... swell, or [i]pool together[]. It keeps its context. It was perhaps an ill-conceived metaphor.
~01~~panel_074~24_hero=Yeah. Where'd the young [i]renegade,[] go?
~01~~panel_074~25_hero3=Unlike [i]me,[] <hero4.mf:he/she/they> did live a whole [i]life.[]
~01~~panel_075~25_hero3=People grow up. Who get the chance to.
~01~~panel_076~1_narration=Later.
~01~~panel_076~23_hero2=Well.
~01~~panel_076~24_hero=[small][i]No...
~01~~panel_077~1_narration=After a wearying march, they arrive there.
~01~~panel_077~24_hero=No!! <hero2>, this's...!!
~01~~panel_078~2_narration=The place <hero2>'s been hoping for in <hero2.mf:his/her/their> heart.
~01~~panel_079~25_hero2=[small]Yeah. Sorry.
