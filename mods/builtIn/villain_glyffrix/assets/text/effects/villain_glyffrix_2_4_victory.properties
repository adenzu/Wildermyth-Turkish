~01~prompt~panel_020~2_speech=[darkGray]Did you know? The more probable outcome was that you would be stuck, one or both, in a story not your own.

And that's not a bad feeling./[face:grim]In a way, I guess I don't know what difference it makes. I've been thinking... that there's a good chance I never leave Netherflare. [small]No one wants to say it, though./[face:neutral]It's almost like we [i]did[] know. Or it doesn't matter if we [i]had[] known. We didn't act with any intention.
