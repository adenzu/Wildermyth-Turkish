~01~~panel_001~2_speech=I begin to wonder, dear Thing. Dear [i]Theevaleen.
~01~~panel_002~2_speech=Let us imagine something.
~01~~panel_002~4_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_002~5_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_003~2_speech=Imagine you accomplish all you intend. \nYour ambitions are realized.
~01~~panel_004~2_speech=You watch, triumphant, as the glittering pelt sinks round those dragonly bones; the vast spirit furls, reduced to one tiny, opaline egg.
~01~~panel_005~2_speech=What [i]happens,[] then, hm?
~01~~panel_006~2_speech=Do you know what else might collapse in the dragon's final throes? The absence there left--will Oruwe fill it? Will she take up all the yokes and yarns that spill slack on the Shadow Dragon's quaking floor?
~01~~panel_007~4_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_007~5_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_008~2_speech=If she does [i]not,[] or if she is unhappy to, or if she but [i]gradually[] bends down for those burdens... how many mountains and myths will topple without a foundation? Might you give a number?
~01~~panel_009~4_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_009~5_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_010~2_speech=A [i]vague[] estimate, even?
~01~~panel_012~2_speech=You are far from guessing or considering, I suppose.
~01~~panel_012~4_action=[darkGray][actionSmall]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_012~5_action=[darkAqua][actionSmall]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_013~2_speech=There is a cosmic price, should Nitherfaruwen shake or shatter. Creation may buckle.\nAnd it is not impossible [i]you[] will die. Or even, somehow, that [i]she--
~01~~panel_014~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Annihilation may come.
~01~~panel_014~4_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]It is no small chance.
~01~~panel_015~4_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]But that would be better than...
~01~~panel_015~5_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]...aborting my Quest.
~01~~panel_016~2_speech=[i]Annihilation[] would be?
~01~~panel_016~3_speech=[darkGreen][i][ui]Yes. Because.
~01~~panel_017~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]If I will not fight to crown Her...
~01~~panel_017~4_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]...then I do not deserve to love Her.
~01~~panel_018~2_speech=And that would be terrific agony, I suppose,\nresigning yourself to... thinking that.
~01~~panel_018~5_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_018~6_action=[darkAqua][actionSmall]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_020~2_speech=You are young to your feelings, I have said. \nAnd I mean that I am old to mine.
~01~~panel_021~2_speech=But I was a girl for all my life's great decisions, and, in fact,\nthat is the only way I can explain them without wincing.
~01~~panel_022~2_speech=I [i]know[] that a girl, a child, a boy... thinks \ndeath is better than disappointment.
~01~~panel_023~2_speech=But a woman, if she has patience, learns. We learn.
~01~~panel_025~2_speech=Because, death. I think you have not \nreally imagined it, Theeva-dear.
~01~~panel_026~2_speech=Call it something grimgray as [i]'annihilation,'[] and I see why it might \nseem distant, incomprehensible. But death is easy to understand.
~01~~panel_027~2_speech=Love, you may not yet realize... it begins and it ends. Even a mother's love, a father's love, even a god's. However much comfort you may find in the scent of her feathers, whether she is your sky, or your ground? Her love is not everything.
~01~~panel_028~2_speech=Your life [i]is.[] It is everything, Theevaleen. It is [i]all[] possibility. And death replaces that with nothing.
~01~~panel_029~2_speech=So when you talk about Oruwe's [i]love--[]
~01~~panel_030~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Her Love.\n\n   \n\n\n\n                                                It [b]is[] life, to me.
~01~~panel_030~4_action=[darkGray][action]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_030~5_action=[darkAqua][action]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_031~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]It is the entirety of the Ambition.\n      Which has become Me.
~01~~panel_032~2_speech=A... [small][i]buh.
~01~~panel_032~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]A. Metamorphosis.
~01~~panel_034~2_speech=An error.
~01~~panel_035~2_speech=Doesn't it seem like an [i]error,[] to you?
~01~~panel_036~2_speech=You are Thrixl, originally. Even a [i]guided[] change can have unintended, un-[i]good[] results. And [i]may[] still be undone.
~01~~panel_036~5_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_037~7_action=[darkAqua][actionSmall]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_038~1_speech=[ui][i][darkGray]       It may. \nBe undone.
~01~~panel_038~2_speech=[ui][i][darkGreen]And yet.
~01~~panel_038~3_speech=[ui][i][darkBlue]Perhaps.
~01~~panel_039~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Would [b]you[] happily return to how you were, Orufel?
~01~~panel_039~4_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]A girl again?
~01~~panel_040~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Would you blithely revert to the unshattered self, she\n        who [b]was[] you, before the labor of all your cracking and growing?
~01~~panel_040~4_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i][b]I[] would not.
~01~~panel_041~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]What it is like to want, and to dread.\n                  I think you cannot grasp it\n                               because it has never escaped you.
~01~~panel_042~3_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i][b]I[] would not go back, Orufel.
~01~~panel_042~4_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]           From all and knowing the taste of nothing... \n              ...to nothing and knowing the taste of all.
~01~~panel_044~2_speech=Ah. Well.
~01~~panel_045~2_speech=I suppose it [i]is[] fun. To imagine something so... [small]small and cornlike...[]
~01~~panel_046~1_speech=...as love. Could threaten the hills of creation. Truly a common [i]vegetable,[] sprouting \nin unlikely soil. Has brought summer to the winter mind, the Thrixl mind. And with it, \nthe winds of ruin.
~01~~panel_047~2_speech=It sure is [i]perilous,[] acrossing worlds.
~01~~panel_047~5_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_047~6_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_048~1_speech=[ui][i][darkGray]It gives you power.
~01~~panel_048~2_speech=[ui][i][darkGreen]It gives you power.
~01~~panel_048~3_speech=[ui][i][darkBlue]It gives you power.
~01~~panel_049~2_speech=It gives you power. And dooms \nyou to seek power's [i]ends.
~01~~panel_051~2_speech=Any next step, our toes may touch the castlestones.\nI will no longer be your guide, then.
~01~~panel_052~1_narration=The country, here, feels hardened.
~01~~panel_052~2_narration=Lights and colors denser, shadows blacker and more wiry.
~01~~panel_053~1_narration=They all can sense journey's end. It's like an eye, opened to them.
~01~~panel_054.(hero4_is_themePiece_petOwl_owl)~3_hero4=I [i]like[] that thing.
~01~~panel_054.(hero4_is_themePiece_petOwl_owl)~4_action=[lightYellow][actionSmall]groo?

[i]Encapsulate.[] But it's worth, I think, investing some [i]seriousness[] in.[face:happy]/All that I've come to realize, [i]through[] this journey we've shared... I think [face:happy]it's a lucky twist that put a normalborn <hero.mf:son/daughter/child> on the path with heroes. Whatever happens... [i]I'm[] okay./[face:talking]And then I want to see <hero4.fullname> \ndancing around with a punchbowl.[hero4.face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_079.(hero_NOT_eLove)~4_hero=<hero.personality:At the beginning of our journey, I would've been\nso fascinated to glimpse us all like this.[face:talking]/[face:interested]That sounds like something [i]I[] would say./[face:talking]I'll try and scoff at stuff, then. /Naw, I get what you're saying. [face:talking]People that're hard to satisfy, like you and me, we feel it uniquely, I think. /You've dealt with so much just \nto [i]bring[] us, though, haven't you?/[face:skeptical]Well, I'm pretty easy. There's got to be \na big old [i]cake,[] tall as me./You've led us all this way. And you still feel some \nextra responsibility, huh?

From my room in my parents' house.../[face:talking]Who would [i]<hero.mf:he/she/they>[] be, that version of <hero> who, after all <hero.mf:he had/she had/they had> experienced in shadowy, strange Netherflare.../I'm sure this [i]ball[] will end up being [i]some[] degree of ridiculous: slightly, stupidly, or menacingly.[face:talking]>

~01~~panel_080.(hero_NOT_eLove)~4_hero=<hero.personality:Familiar faces now. But [i]two[] at least, that I would not know.

Watching people's plates. Questioning your own palate. Pointing at your pet lizard and hoping he's not too nervous to stick his tongue out./I'm sorry about it. We only really pulled you\ninto battles you had no business in.[face:happy]/[face:joke]If there's not, though, I'll be forced to [i]riot.[] /[face:happy]I understand the impulse. To whatever degree a young <hero.mf:man's head/woman's head/head> [i]can[] understand you, I do. But I promise we won't riot and rip the curtains./[face:neutral]It's already too late for disappointment.

Only if <hero.mf:he/she/they> planned on taking you with <hero.mf:him/her/them>, I guess, could such a thing be forgiven./[face:happy]But if it proves to be dumb, dull, and boring,\nI wouldn't really mind.

~01~~panel_082~5_hero4=<hero4.gkMystic/gkWarrior/gmHunter:[face:happy]So I can say, earnestly, and without pause, even my wilder ambitions are, to this point, well-exceeded.

It has been an honor, and an unlooked for joy. I felt much, in this span... of... I will call it [i]'lifeagain.'/The only disappointment would be not finally meeting this dragon. I [i]may[] miss, Elthiar, your coy and familiar way.
