~01~prompt~panel_012~2_narration=Constant wonders emerged through conversation as the meal went on. As guests ate, their injuries healed. They smiled to each other, biting down on rum-pies, brandishing unmarred wrists, rubbing newly unbruised eyes.
~01~prompt~panel_012~3_narration=None had died; someone at one point noticed that. \n    And what a great marvel [b]that[] was \n      when they considered it.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_narration=Before retiring, the dragon went round to each guest. Slow, and with state. Sharing words. Then, in perhaps the sole moment all night when not an eye was turned their way, Glyffrix seemingly disappeared.
~01~prompt~panel_013~3_narration=Not long later, Elthiar led her companions away, \ndown one hundred and ninety-nine steps...

~01~prompt~panel_016~3_speech=Better you had not mentioned it.

~01~prompt~panel_017~6_hero=[small]Well...
~01~prompt~panel_018~3_speech=Some of us can be sensitive about our appearance.
~01~prompt~panel_018~4_speech=[darkBlue][small]I'm not sensitive, I'm vain. But. She.
~01~prompt~panel_019~3_speech=[small]Because I wished [i]also[] to hear it.
~01~prompt~panel_019~4_speech=[darkBlue][i]She[] was insistent. That I permit \nyou this special audience.
~01~prompt~panel_020~3_speech=I [i]also[] wanted to hear it, you huge, lazy lizardbat.

~01~prompt~panel_023~1_narration=That massive head, heavy as an oaktree, whips round horribly quick.

~01~prompt~panel_023~6_action=[blue][actionSmall]thwoosh!
~01~prompt~panel_024~3_speech=[small]You [i]do.[] Stop being... too much.

~01~prompt~panel_025~3_speech=[i]'I have foreseen great danger, Elthiar, and it needs great \nanswer.'[] When we planned for a ball, you said this to me.
~01~prompt~panel_025~4_speech=[darkBlue]Really?
~01~prompt~panel_026~3_speech=But I think, no. You had no premonition. The goddess [i]told[] you. That one of hers--\nTheevaleen--had left the wood, seeking your head. She asked to have him back and \nyou vowed to return him--[small]flippantly, one can only assume.[] Is this not correct, or close?
~01~prompt~panel_026~4_speech=[darkBlue]Are you [i]asking[] me?
~01~prompt~panel_027~3_speech=But why did she want you to save [i]him?[] \nAnd did you even consider whether \nor not he [i]deserved[] it?
~01~prompt~panel_028~4_speech=[darkBlue]You [i]know[] I'm not someone to quibble over deserving. That's \na question bitter creatures clutter their homes with.

~01~prompt~panel_034.(hero4_is_gmHunter)~6_hero4=But I loved that <sponsor.mf:man,/woman,/[i]goose.[]> <sponsor>. Perhaps simply because... <sponsor.mf:he/she/they> \napologized. Even [i]earnestly,[] sometimes, after drinking. [face:interested]
