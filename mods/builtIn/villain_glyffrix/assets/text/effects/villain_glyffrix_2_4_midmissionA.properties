~01~~panel_024~4_hero2=<hero2.personality:[face:skeptical]<hero2> swallows a hundred questions. Knowing that a better time to ask will come. As long as <hero2.mf:he stays/she stays/they stay> reasonably focused, everyone will survive, and there will be a time for questions. Or that becomes <hero2.mf:his/her/their> hope./[face:interested]<hero2>, who knows fear, recognizes it in the Lostling's face, \nmaybe for the first time. So <hero2.mf:he feels/she feels/they feel> suddenly akin to Elthiar. \nAnd scared for everyone's lives./[face:neutral]In another time, a younger time, <hero2.mf:he/she/they> would've said it anyway, despite the strange sorrow in Elthiar's face. Instead, now, <hero2.mf:he purses his/she purses her/they purse their> lips./[face:interested]<hero2> recognizes something in Elthiar, then. The lostling's worry is not for those she is guiding, but for herself. There is some risk she is afraid to run. <hero2> recognizes it. And feels more deeply afraid./[face:neutral]<hero2> can't shake the feeling that Elthiar is afraid. \nOf what, <hero2.mf:he/she/they> can't nearly say, but <hero2.mf:he senses/she senses/they sense> it. \nAnd <hero2.mf:senses, too, that he/senses, too, that she/sense, too, that they> should not ask now./[face:interested]Normally, when <hero2> suspects <hero2.mf:his/her/their> companions of being afraid, <hero2.mf:he'll/she'll/they'll> boast and scowl. Be brash, if <hero2.mf:he/she/they> can't be brave. But seeing Elthiar's worried eyes... <hero2.mf:his/her/their> voice sinks between <hero2.mf:his/her/their> ribs./[face:grim]It's an expression the Lostling hasn't shown so far, and <hero2.mf:he wonders/she wonders/they wonder> \nwho it's for. That crumpled forehead, that straining jaw. That strange \nconflicted mouth, those in-gazing eyes./[face:grim]Certainly not with anyone who was not a lover, or blood-related. So it's an alien moment. Looking at Elthiar, <hero2.mf:he thinks he understands/she thinks she understands/they think they understand> her. But <hero2.mf:he/she/they> cannot even say what feeling it is that grims her face.[face:grim]/[face:grim]<hero2> has always been one to listen, to look. <hero2.mf:He makes/She makes/They make> it a formal practice, being attentive to what is around and within <hero2.mf:him/her/them>. So <hero2.mf:he's/she's/they're> worried: the thing <hero2.mf:he senses/she senses/they sense> from Elthiar--overridingly--is [b]pain./[face:grim]<hero2.mf:He/She/They> would gaze into the golden light with an earned sorrow in <hero2.mf:his/her/their> eyes, a pain others would see and not ask about. It's the kind of look Elthiar now wears. The kind <hero2.mf:he now wishes he/she now wishes she/they now wish they> didn't someways understand./[face:grim]<hero2>'s answer was often mockery, misdirection. Ways to look past what might be painful. But when <hero2.mf:he sees/she sees/they see> Elthiar's face in that moment... all <hero2.mf:he/she/they> can do is bite <hero2.mf:his/her/their> tongue. Elthiar's fear makes <hero2.mf:him/<hero2>/them> afraid.>
