~01~prompt~panel_001~2_target=[small][i]Here,[] I think...
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_hero=<hero2>'s saying the gate won't budge.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=Progress is prevented by a great monolith of metal.
~01~prompt~panel_002~4_hero3=[small]Definitely stinks[i] worse[] down here.
~01~prompt~panel_002~5_hero2=[small]I think that's... bodyparts. The [i]unused[] things.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_target2=[small]Hm?
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_target=Is this hulk back here a [i]lockswitch?[] \n[small]<target2.mf:Lord/Lady/Master> <target2>? Can it perhaps open the gate?
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_target=[small]Yeah? What [i]bones[] are those?
~01~prompt~panel_005~4_target2=Oh-[i]ho![] [i]Someone[] was a craftsman!
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_target=[i]What?[]
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_target2=Mm, [i]however...[]
~01~prompt~panel_006~5_action=[actionSmall]whp.
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_target=[i]Oh.[]
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_hero=One of you going to [i]yank[] on it?
~01~prompt~panel_009~5_target2=[small]Kff!
~01~prompt~panel_010~7_action=[actionSmall]...kf[]-AAAH-ha-ha-ha-[actionSmall]haaa...!!
~01~prompt~panel_011~5_target=The switch [i]itself...[] contains a... may I call it a [i]life?[]
~01~prompt~panel_012~6_hero=[i]What?[]
~01~prompt~panel_012~7_action=[actionSmall]...ka-fa, \n    ka-faa...!
~01~prompt~panel_013~7_action=[actionSmall]...kfoo-hoo-hoo-hooo...!
~01~prompt~panel_013~8_hero=You mean it's one of your... the [i]Deathless?[] Who'd volunteer for [i]that?
~01~prompt~panel_013~9_target=Likely no one.
~01~prompt~panel_014~10_hero2=[small][i]What[] is?
~01~prompt~panel_014~11_hero=[small]Um.
~01~prompt~panel_014~4_target2=What a [i]glisteningly[] uncomfortable concept!
~01~prompt~panel_015~11_target=What will [i]happen,[] <target2>?
~01~prompt~panel_015~12_hero2=[small]I guess...
~01~prompt~panel_015~4_target2=Yes, what [i]will[] happen?
~01~prompt~panel_015~8_hero=[small]Can I tell you later?
~01~prompt~panel_016~4_target2=I suppose one of us must \nshake its [i]hand,[] and find out?
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_narration=The lights in the chamber produce a warm hum.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_narration=Shuffleclick movements occasionally echo \nfrom the gate's unseen side.
~01~prompt~panel_019~12_target=Well. [small]I suppose [i]I[] should not...
~01~prompt~panel_019~13_target2=[small]Yes.
~02~choice_two~panel_001~2_target2=Yes, and I am old. Naturally curious.\nAllow [i]me[] to meet the poor soul.
~02~choice_two~panel_001~3_darken=[small][green]Young <target> will join the party.
~03~choice_one~panel_001~2_target2=Yes, you should not refuse. \nIt [i]is,[] after all, [i]your[] revenge.
~03~choice_one~panel_001~3_darken=[small][gold]Professor <target2> will join the party.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_narration=Receiving no argument, <target2> shifts \nto stand before the pull-cord.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_002~12_target=Let us be ready when the gate \nopens. Leegan [i]cannot[] escape.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_002~13_hero=[small]Are you just...?
~04~player_chose_two~panel_002~8_action=[actionSmall][gray]poke.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_004~13_hero=<hero.hothead/leader/loner/poet/snark/80:[i]Professor,[] um, [small]<target2>...[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]Professor? You can [i]explain.[] There [i]is[] time./Should I try and say anything?[face:grim]\n[small]I never quite know./[face:grim]It's [i]odd,[] Professor <target2>.../[face:skeptical]<target2>? Pr... um. [small][i]Professor?[]/[i]Professor,[] um, [small]<target2>...>
~04~player_chose_two~panel_005~15_target2=You are a very [i]human[] person. A <hero.whm:deadly hand in a fight/skilled hunter/talented [i]spellcrafter[]>, obviously. \nBut that is far less rare. And far less precious.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_005~16_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/60:I... [small]interesting appraisal. But./Hm? [small]I don't know if... mm./I don't know. About that./[face:neutral]And you're a [i]generous[] person./Well, no, I mean... [small][face:grim]that kid's being a.../I'm only trying to keep us all... [small]mm. But.[face:neutral]/Oh. [small][i]What?>
~04~player_chose_two~panel_006~15_target2=Mmm... well.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_006~16_hero=<hero.personality:But, so, if you were [i]predicting[] how this could turn out... you'd say e[face:skeptical]/What if...? No, sorry. E/At least e/[face:skeptical]Just [i]tell[] me. E/[face:neutral]Can I ask... e/[face:skeptical]Look, [i]anyway,[] e/[face:grim]Should I...? E/[face:grim]But, so. E/[face:grim]No, just... I think you're keeping <target2.mf:a crust in your beard/a quill in your hair/a quill in your hair>. Is the expression. E/Just, I hope... e/[face:skeptical]I guess... e>verything'll be [i]fine,[] right?
~04~player_chose_two~panel_007~17_target2=[i]Everything[] is a lot to promise.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_008~17_target2=But. <target> is right.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_009~15_target2=Focus is better than fretting. Take your position. With <target.mf:him/her/them>, before the gate. \nAnd be ready. Your foe is fiercer even than old [i]<target2>.[]
~04~player_chose_two~panel_010~15_target2=I ask you keep <target.mf:him/her/them> alive. <target>, I mean. That is my request.\nKeep <target.mf:him/her/them> alive, wherever you end up taking <target.mf:him/her/them> to.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_010~18_hero=[small]You say that like...
~04~player_chose_two~panel_011~19_target2=I am a teacher, <hero>. [i]Seeming[] to know is my entire profession!
~04~player_chose_two~panel_012~18_hero=I mean, even [i]before.[] \nYou seemed to [i]know...[]
~04~player_chose_two~panel_014~17_hero=I'll go stand over there.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_014~18_target2=Yes. Do.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_016~1_narration=Silence has fallen beyond the massive doors.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_017~7_hero2=I still don't fully understand.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_017~8_hero=[i]No one[] does. Except maybe that old <target2.mf:man/woman/one>.\nAnd [i]<target2.mf:he's/she's/they're>[] too careful to give anything away.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_018~18_target2=Sorry.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_019~18_target2=And. Sorry for the sweaty palm.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_019~19_action=[actionSmall][gray]swup.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_019~1_narration=Grasping hold.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_020~20_action=[actionSmall][green]
~04~player_chose_two~panel_020~2_narration=The feeling starts as a small shock.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_021~1_narration=Gaining intensity.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_021~20_action=[actionSmall][green]
~04~player_chose_two~panel_021~2_narration=It steadily repeats.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_022~1_narration=And as <target2.mf:he pulls/she pulls/they pull> down the cord...
~04~player_chose_two~panel_022~20_action=[action][green]jULk!!
~04~player_chose_two~panel_023~20_action=[actionLarge][green]CLANG!!
~04~player_chose_two~panel_023~22_target2=[small]Ooch!
~04~player_chose_two~panel_025~1_narration=...<target2.mf:he enters/she enters/they enter> a world like wax.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_026~4_target2=[light]It is at least soft and warm.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_027~1_narration=Blank and bloodsmelling.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_027~2_narration=A wash of indistinct emotions and memories, like the gentlest tide, fails to sway the old Morthificer's skirts.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_028~4_target2=[light]I think you will be glad to know... \n   while [i]<target.mf:he/she/they>[] would have let you live...
~04~player_chose_two~panel_029~4_target2=[light]...[i]I[] am not so sentimental.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_030~1_narration=Meanwhile...
~04~player_chose_two~panel_030~4_hero=<target2>? [i]<target2.mf:Lord/Lady/Master> <target2>?
~04~player_chose_two~panel_031~8_hero=Your [i]friend's[] unresponsive.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_031~9_target=[small]But it is [i]opening...[]
~04~player_chose_two~panel_032~10_action=[actionLarge][red]...grrrnn...
~04~player_chose_two~panel_032~11_action=[darkRed]...crrufff....
~04~player_chose_two~panel_032~12_action=[actionSmall][gray]...reeeshhh....
~04~player_chose_two~panel_032~1_narration=The metal groans, creaks, and finally grinds inwards.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_033~1_narration=Sharp cold air trims further words from their tongues.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_narration=Mismatched looks jangle between them.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~12_target2=This is how it is. Vengeance is being offered to you, <target>. Can you \ncommit yourself to it, knowing you will not live to see it manifest?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~13_hero=[small]You mean, it'll...? <target.mf:He'll/She'll/They'll>...?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~10_target=What you are saying...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~10_target=...is that he was [i]always[] out of my reach.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~5_target2=Even for [i]my[] powers, Leegan Longblade is a stretch.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_006~12_hero=But.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_006~13_target=Then. <target2>, you... and, no, [i]you three.[] \nYou have to make sure <target2.mf:he succeeds/she succeeds/they succeed>.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~10_target=Speed may still matter. So. Get in position, old <target2.mf:man/woman/crook>.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_008~10_target=Did you expect me to [i]argue?[]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_008~12_target2=Is that really all you wish to say?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_009~10_target=You must never have [i]listened[] to me, professor. \nI wonder if you [i]thought[] you were listening.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_009~5_target2=Did I expect [i]you[] to argue? [small]Absolutely.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_011~10_target=I just pull [i]down[] on this handle-part.\nCorrect? Will there be anything else?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_012~12_target2=[i]Hm![]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_013~10_target=Good. Nothing complicated.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_013~12_target2=Probably pain.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_014~12_hero=Will <target.mf:he/she/they> really...?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_014~13_target2=Come, let us leave <target.mf:him/her/them> to it.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_015~2_narration=<target> steps up to the device.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_016~14_target=Go.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_016~15_hero=I know.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_017~1_narration=Silence has fallen beyond the massive doors.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_018~7_hero2=I still don't fully understand.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_018~8_hero=[i]No one[] does. Except maybe that old <target2.mf:man/woman/one>.\nAnd [i]<target2.mf:he's/she's/they're>[] too careful to give anything away.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_019~18_target=Whoever lives inside...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_020~18_target=I shudder to think what horrors you have lived.\nIn this tiny bleak prison. Truly. Sadly. Deathless.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_020~19_action=[actionSmall][gray]swup.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_020~1_narration=Grasping hold.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_021~20_action=[actionSmall][green]
~05~player_chose_one~panel_021~2_narration=The feeling starts as a small shock.

~05~player_chose_one~panel_023~20_action=[action][green]jULk!!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_024~20_action=[actionLarge][green]CLANG!!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_024~22_target=[small]Nn... o... I...!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_026~1_narration=...<target.mf:he enters/she enters/they enter> a world like wax.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_027~4_target=[light]Oh.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_028~4_target=[light]I was really so afraid. \nWhen it came down to it.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_029~4_target=[light]But [i]here[] is so... soft and warm.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_030~1_narration=Blank and bloodsmelling.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_030~2_narration=A wash of indistinct emotions and memories, like the gentlest tide, takes young <target> up on its swells.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_031~4_target=[light]It [i]does[] seem peaceful.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_032~1_narration=Meanwhile...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_032~4_hero=<target>? [i]<target>!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_033~8_hero=<target.mf:He's/She's/<target> is> unresponsive.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_033~9_target2=[small]That is alright.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_034~8_hero=<target.mf:He's/She's/They're>...?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_034~9_target2=Mm. Safer than [i]we[] are.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_035~10_action=[tan][actionSmall]...bbr[action]uumm[actionSmall]mmm...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_035~9_target2=For, behold! The emperor's assassin...!
