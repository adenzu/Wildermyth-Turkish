~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=A lull.
~01~prompt~panel_001~4_hero=[small]Are they... []<hero.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/poet/romantic/snark/80:[face:interested]hopefully, [i]retreating?[]/[face:interested]maybe getting [i]sick[] of us?/hopefully, letting [i]up?[]/starting to [i]fear[] us? [i]Ha![][face:angry]/at all [i]shaken?[][face:interested]/losing interest?[face:interested]/giving up? [i]Why?[]/maybe, [i]relenting?[]>
~01~prompt~panel_001~5_target=[i]Are[] they?
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_target=<target2>, they...!! [small]No?
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_target2=Take a hard look, <target>.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_target2=They [i]quiver.[] Like excited dogs. \nThey [i]sense[] their master's arrival.
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_hero=Who?
~01~prompt~panel_004~4_target=[small]Do you really mean...?
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_speech=The name Queen Soogen dreamed nine years ago...
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_speech=...was Dunnaveer.
~01~prompt~panel_005~4_speech=Our immortal destroyer.
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_target2=In a single Spring he has dismantled the world.
~01~prompt~panel_007~4_target2=Mighty Kyor. Built over six centuries. \nStripped to its bones in a [i]season.[]
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_target=Even now, I feel [i]undeserving.[]
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_hero2=What's [i]that[] mean?
~01~prompt~panel_009~4_target=My family, my friends. So many died defending the Queenland.
~01~prompt~panel_010~4_target=All more gifted... more courageous than myself. That [i]I[] am the one who sees his face. Our enemy.
~01~prompt~panel_011~4_target=That [i]I[] am the one... who stands before him at the end...
~01~prompt~panel_012~4_target=I can only wonder why \nHada chose me.
~01~prompt~panel_013~4_hero2=<hero2.personality:[face:neutral]But that's fairly [i]revelatory,[] isn't it? That you consider this a privilege? I think you're more exceptional than you understand./[face:interested]Ah. I [i]do[] get that. [small]That feeling.[] I'm sorry, I deal with \nit myself. But it doesn't... well. I [i]do[] keep going./[face:interested]Yeah, that stuff sucks, huh? Or I mean, I don't know what to say. Sometimes I imagine them. The gone ones. I try to... you know. Just talk. Share the old jokes we shared. Even if it's sad, I... [small]end up smiling./The way I look at it, the best way to remember someone...\nI mean, you [i]can't[] remember them. If you don't [i]survive.[]/I get it. That guilt. But then this's your [i]chance.[] To change the course of history. And maybe change your own mind, hm?[face:neutral]/Well [i]stop.[] Stop feeling that way. You think it helps them? I'd be [i]pissed[] if I died in some cool way, and <hero> over here just spent <hero.mf:his/her/their> time feeling guilty. Come on, let's just [i]kill[] this thing./That guilt won't change anything. But you [i]do[] have the chance, while you live. To change the course of history. To change your own mind. Your enemy, after all, is in front of you.[face:grim]/[face:grim]Naw. Don't carry useless weight. \nLet's just kill [i]him, too.[] Right?/[face:neutral]I see your struggle. But I think of <folk1.fullname>, who writes: [i]"I who, ceaseless, strove to judge my own place in the myth of my times: had I not just as well have asked the raindrops about the next day's sky?"/[face:neutral]Used to think about this kind of thing a lot. And I think your mind is [i]right.[] It's a privileged part we're playing. So let's make the most of it and win. That's how you prove you deserve to be here. Right?/Eh. But. Alright. But let's just take him [i]down.[]\nCan't we? And be miserable afterwards?>
~01~prompt~panel_014~8_target2=Mm. Every dragon dies. And in the egg, quickens again.
~01~prompt~panel_015~3_hero=<hero2.personality:<hero2>, what if we just [i]kill[] it?/[face:interested]There's also just a chance we [i]win.[] Right?/Has anyone... what if we just [i]win?[]/[face:interested]What if we just... [i]win?[] Right?/Do you mean we try and bring him [i]down?[][face:interested]/<hero2>, but... well, [i]can[] we?/We just try to bring him down, huh?/<hero2>, but... [i]Can[] we?/Um. But [i]I'm[] thinking... what if we kill this thing?/<hero2>, but... [i]Can[] we? Can we even kill it?/That really an [i]option?>
~01~prompt~panel_015~7_hero3=Even [i]dragons[] die.
~01~prompt~panel_016~10_hero2=That's... [small][i]obnoxious.
~01~prompt~panel_016~11_hero=[small]It's [i]unfair.
~01~prompt~panel_016~7_target2=Twice, at the Battle of Foxbridge, Dunnaveer's body was destroyed. And twice, he remanifested. While [i]any[] in his numberless brood live... we believe he needs fear no fate.
~01~prompt~panel_016~9_target=[small]But [small]still...
~01~prompt~panel_017~5_target=[i]Still,[] <target2>. I cannot help but feel...
~02~choice_two~panel_001~1_target2=No. It is [i]enough.[] You should live, \n<target>. And all of you. [i]Go.[]
~02~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=[small][purple]Young <target> will join the party.
~03~choice_one~panel_001~2_target=Is it really too strange to have a little faith? A little hope at the end? We can [i]win.[]
~03~choice_one~panel_001~3_darken=[small][gold]Captain <target2> will join the party.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_001~10_target2=Or die with me if you prefer it. I cannot make that decision for you.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_001~9_target=<target2>...?
~04~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_narration=One by one...
~04~player_chose_two~panel_002~4_action=[purple][actionSmall]...skreeg...
~04~player_chose_two~panel_002~5_action=[aqua][actionSmall]...skrshh...
~04~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_narration=...tremorous bodies settle, ready to pitch themselves forward.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_action=[purple][actionSmall]...flivixxx...
~04~player_chose_two~panel_004~11_hero2=<hero>?
~04~player_chose_two~panel_005~12_hero=Yeah. We're... we'll make it out.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_005~13_target2=Do so.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_narration=And so, at the end, <target2.fullname> stands alone before <target2.mf:his/her/their> people's great enemy. Somehow hoping.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_007~16_target2=[small]Hada, I shall [i]strike[] him.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_narration=It's a small and pointless aspiration. \nBut <target2.mf:he/she/they> imagines it, and is proud.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_007~2_narration=This meager hope gives <target2.mf:him/her/them> courage.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_008~15_target2=I shall [i]strike[] him!
~04~player_chose_two~panel_009~4_target2=[light]Hada willing! He shall feel [i]pain[] \n   at the point of my spear!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~11_target2=God is not... [small]He is not [i]here,[] <target>...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~12_target=How can you [i]know that[]?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_narration=One by one...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~4_action=[purple][actionSmall]...skreeg...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~5_action=[aqua][actionSmall]...skrshh...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_narration=...tremorous bodies settle, ready to pitch themselves forward.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_action=[purple][actionSmall]...flivixxx...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~14_hero3=I [i]agree[] with the young <target.mf:man/lady/one>. <target>, is it? \nEven if I maybe shouldn't, I just think...<hero3.coward/goofball/greedy/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]/[face:neutral]>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~13_hero3=You can't be so decided on death that you've abandoned all thought of victory.<hero3.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested].. right? Doesn't that sound right?/[face:skeptical] That'll leave you [i]toothless.[]/[face:skeptical] Right? That'd be really worthless./[face:skeptical] I mean you [i]can,[] but it's [i]weak.[]/[face:neutral] Have to leave room. For miracles. Even if they never do... materialize./[face:skeptical] Right? Or do you want us to lie down?/ Whatever you're defending, it's worth more than that. Wouldn't you say so?>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_006~15_target2=Promise me [i]what?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~14_target=I think we... no. I [i]promise you,[] <target2>...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_008~14_target=Hada shall protect his children! \nWe [i]will[] survive! [i]Kyor[] will survive!
~05~player_chose_one~panel_009~1_narration=Promises are not always ours to keep.
