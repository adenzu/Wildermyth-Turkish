~01~~panel_001~3_thought=[light]Ah.
~01~~panel_002~2_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Yes.
~01~~panel_002~3_thought=[light]Am I here again?
~01~~panel_003~3_thought=[darkGreen][ui][i]How many circles round...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     ...will you thus, uselessly, wind?
~01~~panel_004~2_speech=[light]Not [i]uselessly.[] Not quite.
~01~~panel_004~3_speech=[light]I am learning things.
~01~~panel_005~3_thought=[darkGreen][ui][i]Do you think so?
~01~~panel_006~2_speech=[light]For instance, I have observed that your \n      imagination is strange but not wide.
~01~~panel_006~3_speech=[light]And I have noticed that you see the smallness of your \n   [i]self[] amidst the universe and are not so scared.
~01~~panel_006~4_speech=[light]So I think you must be very [i]old.[]
~01~~panel_007~2_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Ancient.
~01~~panel_008~2_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]You must already know.
~01~~panel_008~3_speech=[light]What is it like?
~01~~panel_009~3_speech=[light]I only know my own experience, I would be curious to hear of yours.
~01~~panel_009~4_speech=[light]What is it like to be in love with an ageless being? \n       Does she flirt back, I wonder?

~01~~panel_012~2_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Love that waits on reciprocation \n            was never love at all.
~01~~panel_013~1_speech=I see. You have my sympathy.
~01~~panel_014~1_speech=But. Don't feel too bad. Her attention is famously \nbroad, her high-up gaze difficult to distract.

~01~~panel_019~1_action=[darkGreen][ui][i]And of her ill-honored mercy.
~01~~panel_019~2_action=[darkGreen][ui][i]I am aware of your crime.
~01~~panel_020~1_speech=Mm. Then I think [i]all[] of this... this is for her. Even your hatred is not really [i]your[] hatred at all. Am I correct?
~01~~panel_022~1_speech=Silence means yes.
~01~~panel_023~1_action=[darkGray]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_023~2_action=[darkAqua]...crk-ck-ck...
~01~~panel_024~1_speech=You give away too much.\nTo be an effective tormenter.
~01~~panel_025~1_speech=[darkGreen][i][ui]Smile.
~01~~panel_026~1_speech=You need not [i]ask,[] I smile quite naturally.
~01~~panel_027~1_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Smile, Orufel.\n\n      Pretend it makes you brave.
~01~~panel_028~2_speech=[darkGreen][ui][i]Just know that, beneath that false \n       and fetching smile...
~01~~panel_029~1_speech=[ui][i][darkGray]...you [b]reek[] of hopelessness.
