~01~~panel_001~3_speech=Satisfied?
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The Forgemaster's artistry is swift as it is impossible. \n    Every rivet, every edge, every seam, and every spell.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=Every thought-of detail forms subtly, between \n      one banging hammerswing and another.
~01~~panel_003~2_speech=But none faster than [i]you.[] \nAnyway, work is work.
~01~~panel_003~3_speech=[light]They give me [i]cornmeal[] requests! \nCrafts any cudgelmug could manage!
~01~~panel_003~6_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:[face:skeptical]/[face:happy]>
~01~~panel_004~3_speech=[light]Who claimed otherwise?! [small][i]Kweghk-hegk!\n[][]Didn't say work wasn't work...
~01~~panel_005~3_speech=[light]...and wages wasn't wwwwages. But it's more \nthan a [i]might[] I'll be seein' [i]you[] againnn[small]nn... isn't it?
~01~~panel_005~5_action=[tan]clop!
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=He leaps down heavily, hitching \n himself to his wagon once more.
~01~~panel_006~2_speech=Careful where you hop.
~01~~panel_006~3_speech=[light][small][i]Hegk!
~01~~panel_006~5_action=[tan]thump!
~01~~panel_006~6_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:/[face:happy]>

~01~~panel_007~2_speech=[light]Y'still refusin' my offer?
~01~~panel_007~3_action=[actionSmall][darkGray]...clunk...\n   ...clink...
~01~~panel_008~1_speech=Careful as you go, young Mauren. The \nway is ever dark, and you are ever so lost.
~01~~panel_008~2_speech=[light]It'll stand till y'don't!
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=He starts away, yanking the great forgewagon after him.
~01~~panel_009~3_speech=[light]And don't y'all go forgettin' me, either...!
~01~~panel_009~4_action=[small][gray]cuh-link!\n    cuh-lunk!
~01~~panel_009~5_action=[tan][actionSmall]...ruckle...\n[light]   ...creeak...
~01~~panel_009~6_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:/[face:happy]>
~01~~panel_010~1_speech=[light]When yer needs're deep and dreadful-dire...!\n   When you'd sell yer own heart for a fifth o' a hope...!
~01~~panel_010~2_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:[face:grim]/[face:happy]>
~01~~panel_011~1_speech=[light]Look for me, [i]thennn[small]nn.[][] My hammer will toll, and you'll [i]smell[] a lovely fire...!
~01~~panel_011~2_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:/[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=The wagon follows its master, \n   and a great dustfog rises \n     to blot them both from view.
~01~~panel_012~3_speech=[light][large][i]Kweghk-[default][light]heghk-heghk[][light][large]-heghk...!!
~01~~panel_012~5_action=[tan][actionSmall]...joggle...\n[light]   ...junkle...
~01~~panel_012~6_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:[face:grim]/[face:happy]>
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=The noise is soon beyond hearing.
~01~~panel_013~2_speech=[small]You will have to tell him next time.
~01~~panel_013~3_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:[face:grim]He almost reminds me of... of old <npc4>.\n[small]If <npc4.mf:that man/that woman/that weirdo> ever went, finally and completely, insane./[face:happy]What a [i]talented[] man.>
~01~~panel_014~2_speech=Better we were away, now.
~01~~panel_014~3_hero2=<hero2.greedy/loner/60:[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/>
~01~~panel_014~4_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:[face:grim]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_014~5_hero=Why's that?<hero.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/romantic/snark/60:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]/>
~01~~panel_015~2_speech=Hm. <hero4.mf:He is/She is/They are> not only <hero4.gmHunter:[i]spooky[]/[i]unnervingly attentive[]>, <hero4.mf:he has/she has/they have> some intuition.
~01~~panel_016~5_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:[face:grim]/[face:talking]>There was something she said about [i]rooted ground,[] before. Permanence and dependibility in a place where nothing is constant would [i]draw[] people.
~01~~panel_017~2_speech=Yes, there are some places--places like this--that [i]never[] change. These become crossings. Where the lost are wont to ramble through, and the hungry to congregate.
~01~~panel_017~5_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]>[small]The [i]hungry,[] huh?
~01~~panel_018~2_speech=Anywhere's crossing is unsafe, but certainly this is more true in Nitherfaruwen than it has ever been in your lives.
~01~~panel_018~5_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:/[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_018~6_hero2=<hero2.personality:[face:grim]You have a way with words, Elthiar. [small]\nThough, I struggle to gauge their [i]authenticity.[]/[face:interested]Yeah? [small]That's... not reassuring./[face:happy][small][i]There's[] that Elthiar gravitas.\nI must've been [i]missing[] it./[face:skeptical]She always has to... [small]well, I guess [i]I'd[] do it too./[face:talking]Sure, but let's also try not to push it. \nElthiar? We're not well-rested./[face:skeptical]So you can [i]say[] that. But. \n[small]My life might surprise you./[face:grim]Then, yeah. No reason to dawdle./[face:grim]Alright./[face:grim]Yeah. I [i]do[] think... [small]my life might surprise you./[face:interested][small]I [i]did[] miss this, the... \n[i]very ominous[] vagaries./[face:dubious][i]Neat.[]>
~01~~panel_018~7_hero=<hero.rivalOf.hero2:[face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_019~1_narration=Without turning to see if they'll follow, she walks off.
~01~~panel_019~7_hero2=<hero2.coward/hothead/80:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_020~6_hero2=Alright, come on. <hero4>. <hero3>?
~01~~panel_020~7_hero4=[small]<hero4.gmHunter:[face:grim]Mm./[face:happy]Yes! Off we go!>
~01~~panel_021~5_hero4=<hero4.gmHunter:[face:neutral]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_021~6_hero2=<hero>?
~01~~panel_021~7_hero=<hero.rivalOf.hero2:What.[face:grim]/Right.>
~01~~panel_022~1_narration=Weary and wracked with their own private doubts,\n       they make again for the unmarked trail.
