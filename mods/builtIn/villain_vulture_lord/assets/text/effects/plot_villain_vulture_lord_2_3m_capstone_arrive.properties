~01~~panel_001~1_bookish=Not guarded?
~01~~panel_001~2_healer=<healer.exists:<healer.bookish/coward/60:All the makings of an ambush./[face:interested]Anyone else... think this looks like an ambush?/We're walking into an ambush, aren't we?>/>
~01~~panel_001~3_hero=<healer.exists:/We're walking into an ambush, aren't we?>
~01~~panel_002~1_hero=Uh, about that...
~01~~panel_003~1_hothead=<hothead.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/snark/60:[face:skeptical]I'm sure they've known of our coming for some time now. We couldn't expect to catch them unprepared./Do we have to go in? I mean, couldn't we wait for them right here?/Hey, at least we [i]know[] we're walking into an ambush. Question is, do they know we know?/[face:skeptical]Probably. But does it matter? We'll be ready for it./[face:dubious]Of course. But at least we [i]know[] we're walking into an ambush./[face:grim]Well, we had to expect something like this. Best we can do now is stay alert. >
~01~~panel_004~1_darken=As if waiting for a cue, they appear.
~01~~panel_004~2_darken=From crack and crevice, silent and staring.
~01~~panel_006~1_darken=Out of the cave's mouth, a creature emerges.
~01~~panel_006~2_darken=It extends one long arm toward them, tilts its bony head at an awkward angle, then turns to walk back into the darkness.
~01~~panel_007~1_bookish=<bookish.coward/goofball/hothead/snark/60:Do you think... it wants us to follow it?/Uh... that looked like an invitation. Should we?/Okay. So you want us to follow you?/[face:skeptical]That's... some kind of invitation. Should we?/I... think we're supposed to follow it.>
~01~~panel_007~2_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/60:I wonder what it wants. Strange they're not attacking./[face:interested]But what does it want? Not that I want to try fighting through these things.../Either that, or we fight our way through these things.>
~01~~panel_008~2_darken=The mineshaft is long and cramped. Their guide leads them steadily on, never turning to see if they are following.
~01~~panel_009~3_darken=Until, finally...
~01~~panel_010~1_darken=...the shaft opens up into a wide room, where a strange sight awaits them.
~01~~panel_011~2_hook2=Ah. Hello there.
~01~~panel_012~1_hook2=Let me guess. You're here to kill us?
~01~~panel_013~2_hero=<hero.bookish/leader/60:Well.../Actually, we.../Well, uh...>
~01~~panel_014~1_hook2=Don't be shy. I get it. You should know my name, first, don't you think?
~01~~panel_014~4_hothead=<hothead.goofball/greedy/healer/loner/60:[face:interested]Umm... is it Commander Boltbody?/You clearly want something./We're a little startled. To be [i]having[] this conversation./[face:grim]I'm not good at introductions./[face:skeptical]I'll say we're not really expecting a long conversation.>
~01~~panel_015~1_hothead=Sorry, our...? Does this thing have to stand right...
~01~~panel_016~1_hook2=<hothead.goofball/greedy/healer/loner/60:[face:dubious]I wasn't suggesting a guessing game. I'm [i]Captain[] Cleelan Barrengast. And what [i]I[] need to know is... what's your cut?/I would like to be [i]civil[] certainly. I'm Captain Cleelan Barrengast. I do wish to know one thing. What's your cut?/Of course, well... Captain Cleelan Barrengast is me. I only want to know one thing. What's your cut?/Fortunately, I'm excellent at them![face:joy] Captain Cleelan Barrengast is me! So just tell me... what's your cut? /Captain Cleelan Barrengast is me. I only want to know one thing. What's your cut?>
~01~~panel_017~2_hook2=Oh, don't mind <hook2.mf:him/her/her>. <hook2.mf:He's/She's/She's> a good <hook2.mf:boy/girl/girl>. They all are. Won't bite unless they're told.
~01~~panel_018~2_hook2=So, yeah. Can't we talk?
~01~~panel_019~2_hook2=You people are good. Really good.\nI might actually be impressed.
~01~~panel_021~2_hook2=And I didn't get where I am today by being a poor judge of flesh!
~01~~panel_022~1_hook2=I won't work with just any old sellsword. Ask those poor goons who got stuck with the Drauven. But when I encounter true [i]quality[]... then I make it a point never to be outbid.
~01~~panel_023~1_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/hothead/leader/60:You... assume our services are for hire./Huh? You think we're doing this for money?/Huh? You think we're doing this for money?/[face:grim]You've got it wrong. No one hired us to do this./Uh, we're not... actually... working for anyone.>
~01~~panel_024~1_hook2=So? What's your cut? Think I can't double it?
~01~~panel_025~1_hook2=<hero.bookish/coward/hothead/leader/60:You going to tell me you're just hunting Morthagi for fun?/You going to tell me you're just hunting Morthagi for fun?/You going to tell me you're just hunting Morthagi for fun!/Ha! Good one! I guess you're just hunting Morthagi for fun!/Ha! Good one! I guess you're just hunting Morthagi for fun!>
~01~~panel_026~1_hothead=<hothead.bookish/coward/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:skeptical]Do you think pay and pleasure are the only worthy motives? There are lives and livelihoods... /[face:interested]For kicks? Why would we...? No, we're only trying to stop you killing people and burning our towns./[face:skeptical]Actually, it's about preserving the things we care for. Our towns, our people--/Actually, it's more about protecting the people we love from your rampaging hordes./[face:dubious]Oh sure. Wouldn't be the fact that you and your lot are threatening our towns and--/Actually, it's more about keeping you and your lackeys from burning down our towns and-->
~01~~panel_027~1_hook2=Yeah, you can drop the hero act around me. You interested or what?
~01~~panel_028~2_bookish=<bookish.coward/goofball/snark/60:[face:interested]In working for those... things?/[face:interested]Uh, no offense, but working for Morthagi's not exactly my dream job./[face:skeptical]Uh, no offense, but working for Morthagi's not exactly my dream job./In... working for Morthagi?>
~01~~panel_028~3_hook2=Look around. Who do you think's working for who?
~01~~panel_029~1_hothead=You mean... this war... and everything that came with it... you're claiming it was [i]your[] doing? What reason could you possibly have to...
~01~~panel_030~1_hook2=Curious? Well, I don't go into particulars with potential recruits. All you need to know is we're mercenaries. Soldiers for hire.
~01~~panel_031~1_volunteer2=Vulta's soldiers!
~01~~panel_033~1_hero=So, if we agree to join you, will you tell us more about this... Vulta?
~01~~panel_034~1_hook2=I'm not an idiot. Do you [i]see[] this brain?
~01~~panel_035~1_hook2=Here's the deal. You want in? You have to pledge. An arm or a leg will suffice. And don't worry, I'll give you something better in its place.
~01~~panel_036.(subplot_exists)~1_hook2=What? <subPlot2.exists:I can see you've made similar trades before, with lesser craftsmen./Not like it's the first trade you've made.> Is it just my face that makes you squeamish now?
~01~~panel_038.(subplot_exists)~1_hothead=You're very chatty.
~01~~panel_039.(subplot_exists)~1_hook2=And you're very dull.
~01~~panel_040.(subplot_is_missing)~1_hothead=You're very chatty.
~01~~panel_041.(subplot_is_missing)~1_hook2=And you're very dull.
~01~~panel_042~1_hook2=Ah, well. Dance with my pets, if it pleases you. I'll still have your bones.
~01~~panel_042~2_narration=<hook2.mf:He clicks his/She clicks her/They click their> tongue and <hook2.mf:turns/turns/turn>, as Morthagi form a wall between them.
