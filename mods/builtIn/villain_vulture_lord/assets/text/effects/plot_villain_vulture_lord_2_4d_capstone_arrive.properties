~01~~panel_001~1_narration=They find the mine unguarded. In the long shafts and chambers below, there are cogs and bones and half-finished projects in every corner.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=But nothing that moves.
~01~~panel_002~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/goofball/leader/poet/snark/60:[face:skeptical]I see no sign of violence. Or any Morthagi... remains./[face:interested]Oh! And then carried off all the Morthagi bodies and tidied the place up just to confuse us?/You'd think there would be some trace of a battle... Morthagi corpses, at the least./Another band like us, mirroring our movements? But why would there be no sign of battle, no Morthagi remains?/[face:skeptical]And then disposed of the Morthagi corpses and tidied this place up to hide all trace of battle? I suppose anything's [i]possible[]./Don't see any... corpses. If that's what you'd call a dead Morthagi.>
~01~~panel_002~2_hothead=<hothead.bookish/greedy/hothead/leader/60:[face:skeptical]It's possible someone else finished them off while we were attending to the Drauven./Think there's some other group trying to steal our thunder? Got here before we could?/Huh. You think some other group took care of them before we could?/[face:grim]Is it possible someone else finished them off for us?/Think someone got here before us? Finished them off?>
~01~~panel_003~1_hero=<hero.bookish/greedy/leader/poet/snark/60:Looks to me as if they departed on their own terms. Hastily enough that they couldn't take everything with them, but still... in an orderly, intentional fashion./I don't know. To me, it looks like they just abandoned this place. Took everything of value with them, left the stuff they had no use for./To me, it looks like their departure was planned, orderly. Took what they could use, left the rest behind./[face:interested]There's such a stillness here... I get the sense that they departed days ago. Though, for what purpose.../I don't know. Looks to me like they went off for their own reasons. Took the valuable stuff with them. Left the junk./I don't know. To me it looks more like they just... packed up and left.>
~01~~panel_004~1_hothead=<hothead.bookish/hothead/snark/60:[face:skeptical]You think they were fleeing from [i]us[]?/[face:happy]Guess they heard about <company> and ran scared./[face:dubious]So... they heard we were coming and ran away?/Heard we were coming and ran away?>
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=They continue their search...
~01~~panel_006~1_bookish=[small]Blood? Was this... an operating table?
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=...but find no answers.
~01~~panel_008~1_bookish=Well, I guess it doesn't matter [i]why[] they're gone, as long as they stay gone.
~01~~panel_009~1_none=They'll hear no news of the Morthagi in the next town, find no trace of them across peak and valley.
~01~~panel_009~2_none=It's an unexpected and uncertain peace that follows.
