~01~~panel_001~1_hothead=Think they're all hiding somewhere? Like the Morthagi?
~01~~panel_001~3_bookish=<bookish.bookish/coward/60:Doubtful. These tents haven't been slept in for days./[face:interested]Uh... tents don't look slept in, but--/Nah. This place's been abandoned for days.>
~01~~panel_002~1_hothead=Cleared out in a hurry, huh?
~01~~panel_003~1_hero=Food is gone. And most of the supplies. <hero.greedy/snark/60:[face:interested]Took everything valuable. Left the junk behind./[face:skeptical]Took everything valuable. Left the junk behind./Seems they left whatever they couldn't carry.>
~01~~panel_004~1_healer=<healer.exists:<healer.bookish/goofball/hothead/romantic/60:Was it our approach that scared them off?/[face:happy]Guess they weren't in a mood for guests./[face:happy]Guess they heard we were coming./[face:happy]Didn't want to face <company>, I guess./Could they be running from [i]us[]?>/>

~01~~panel_005~1_narration=In their apparent haste, the Drauven left an obvious trail. They follow it a few days, into the thick of the forest, where the prints suddenly vanish.
~01~~panel_005~2_bookish=<bookish.coward/goofball/hothead/snark/60:Yeah... nothing over here. You see anything, <hothead>? /[face:interested]Some weird animal droppings over here. But no sign of Drauven./[face:interested]If they were trying to trick us... It worked./That's bear prints, <hothead>. You can follow them if you want, but... /Either they started covering their tracks, or this whole trail was a ruse.>
~01~~panel_006~1_hero=<hero.coward/hothead/60:You two think... maybe they'll lay low for a while? With the Morthagi gone and all.../Been thinking. Maybe with the Morthagi out of the picture, Drauven'll cool off. No grudges to settle. Lay low a while./Been thinking. For all we know, the Morthagi were the instigators. Maybe, with them gone, Drauven'll settle down... lay low for a while.>
~01~~panel_006~2_hothead=[small]Ever known Drauven to lay low?
~01~~panel_007~1_hero=Might be wishful thinking, sure. But if they have no more need for mercenaries...
~01~~panel_007~2_bookish=You think <hero.vulture_mercFriend:<hook>'ll/they'll> come home?
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=In the nearest town, they'll hear no news of Drauven...
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=The tangled forest will tell them nothing more.
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=...or of the mercenaries who were with them.
~01~~panel_009~2_hero=<hero.vulture_mercFriend:/[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=A strange, uncertain peace follows.
