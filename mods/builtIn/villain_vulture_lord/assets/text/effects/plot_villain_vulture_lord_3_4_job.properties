~01~~panel_009~3_healer=<healer.coward/loner/60:It was just a hunch, really.

~01~~panel_018~1_npc=Those squatters were your enemies as much as ours.
~01~~panel_019~1_bookish=Sure. But if I had to choose between letting Deepists dig their holes in some mountain, or bowing to your <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> Vulta...
~01~~panel_020~1_action=*sigh*
~01~~panel_021~1_npc=I remain grateful for the aid that <healer.vulture_metSidekick:you gave us/I received>. I did wish that some of you might understand. But time, it seems, has wrought little change in the human heart.
~01~~panel_022~1_healer=What are we to understand? Vulta has shown us nothing but cruelty. Maybe if you told us what <legend.mf:he was/she was/they were> trying to--
~01~~panel_023~1_npc=You have set yourselves against my <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>. I will tell you nothing.
~01~~panel_024~1_healer=Fine. Let me see if I can put it together. We've heard the legend of the Vulture <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>. Can't say how much of it's [i]true[], but it fits Vulta well enough. So <legend.mf:he/she/they> found some way to escape <legend.mf:his/her/their> prison, and returned to Graymountain.
~01~~panel_026~1_healer=Wasn't enough, though, just to be free. <legend.mf:He/She/They> wanted to make us suffer, to make us grovel. The Drauven and Morthagi... and the mercenaries... <legend.mf:he/she/they> set them against each other to create chaos, and maybe for <legend.mf:his/her/their> amusement. Those who survived <legend.mf:he/she/they> made into <legend.mf:his/her/their> army.
~01~~panel_027~1_bookish=<legend.mf:His/Her/Their> soldiers one day, <legend.mf:his/her/their> meal the next. <legend.mf:He/She/They> used them all, just like <legend.mf:he's/she's/they're> been using you.
~01~~panel_028~1_npc=You know nothing!
~01~~panel_029~1_npc=We were shivering, cowering beasts when we first came to this valley. Calling ourselves humans, as if that [i]meant[] something.
~01~~panel_030~1_npc=<legend.mf:He was/She was/They were> powerful beyond our understanding. <legend.mf:He/She/They> could have swept us away with one beat of <legend.mf:his/her/their> mighty wings. But no. From <legend.mf:his/her/their> mountain <legend.mf:he/she/they> looked down, and [i]pitied[] us.
~01~~panel_031~1_npc=<legend.mf:He/She/They> shared with us the thing <legend.mf:he/she/they> held most precious. We recognized <legend.mf:him/her/them> as our rightful <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>. Our protector, our savior.
~01~~panel_032~1_npc=Until... they betrayed <legend.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~~panel_032~2_hero=Because <legend.mf:he was/she was/they were> a <hero.greedy/60:/greedy >tyrant?
~01~~panel_033~1_npc=<legend.mf:He/She/They> asked nothing of us that <legend.mf:he/she/they> did not ask of all beasts. \nWhy [i]must[] you bury your dead? You'd rather feed the worms?
~01~~panel_034~1_npc=And so I chose... to stand with <legend.mf:him/her/them>, where I belonged. Where my loyalty was due.
~01~~panel_035~1_healer=Look, <npc>. I'm not going to defend those ancients. They're just storybook characters, to me. Whether what they did was right or wrong or something in between... I don't know.
~01~~panel_036~1_healer=But what Vulta's doing [i]now[]? Killing and conquering us over some old grudge? Hard to see <legend.mf:him/her/them> as a benevolent ruler.
~01~~panel_037~1_bookish=Yeah, just how old [i]are[] you, anyway?
~01~~panel_038~1_npc=<legend.mf:He is/She is/They are> not what... it was the humans... humans who made <legend.mf:him/her/them> be... long, long ago.

~01~~panel_042~2_healer=What do we do with our captive? Don't want to kill <npc.mf:him/her/them>. Don't like the idea of setting <npc.mf:him/her/them> loose, either.
~01~~panel_043~1_npc2=Oh! You can leave <npc.mf:him/her/them> with me! Would like to get a good sketch...
