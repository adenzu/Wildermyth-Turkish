So.../Yeah, so, [i]<healer>.[] I should say it formally, shouldn't I? No one's ever mistaken me for the dazzling hero. I'm not that kind of person, am I? What I [i]am[] is... a pretty earnest believer in doing what I can. To help those that need it.

The thing is, I look after myself pretty carefully, right? And I like living comfortably, when I can. But these days... these days, that's not possible. And the way to look after ourselves? Is to look after [i]everyone.[] I know, it's lame. But, so.../Yeah, so, [i]<healer>.[] I should say it with manners, at least. People say I'm brave. It's because I've got the [i]privilege[] of courage. I have a few rare talents, I've had the right opportunities. But anyway... I want good things for this land's people. I think you do to. That's... I mean, and so.../[face:skeptical]Yeah, so, [i]<healer>.[] I should say it formal. That's good manners, isn't it? Here's what you need to know about me. I'm brave--sometimes stupidly so. I'm loyal--sometimes fiercely so. I eat a lot, I sleep a little. I don't let friends fight alone. What else do you need to know? So.../[i]<healer>.[] I should say it formally. In truth, I was looking to form a group of my own, last <season-3>. Unfortunately, it came to nothing. That's why I was pleased to hear about you, and eager to make your acquaintance. Maybe it [i]is[] fortune uniting us. So.../No, I don't know. Um, <healer>? I should say it out loud. People like that, right?[face:grim] I'm strong. I'm abler than anyone you're likely to meet. And I'm fed up with the past three years, the way this land has been torn up. Quiet places... have become weeping places. And so.../Yeah, so, [i]<healer>.[] I ought to put it succinctly. And formally. They say you should sooner trust a spider to spin your clothes, than a stranger to guard your door. That's what they say, in this land. I hope that'll be a foreign phrase here, someday. And that's partially why.../Yeah, so, [i]<healer>.[] Let me honor the moment, and make this formal. Folks know me for my flair, and for my wit, and for the way my gaze rakes a sunlit field. But they also know I'm someone to depend on. I'm [i]strong.[] And so.../No, sorry. I don't know. <healer>? I should say it straight, and have it out. I'm a <volunteer.mf:man/woman/person> who's...

Maybe I sound flippant, but I [i]am[] serious that.../No, I don't know. I'm not looking to be anyone's roped-around rookie. I want my own share of recognition, you know? I want my reputation to thrive, I want my own [i]piece.[] But I'll say, I expect to earn it. Make it something no one begrudges me. And with that in mind.../No, I hope I'm not overstepping. All I was saying, or asking about, was... I just have it in me to help. To make life in this land a little more bearable. Because I've seen grim things, and I've seen them more and more. And if... I'll say that if.../[face:grim]But yeah, I don't have a whole eloquent speech prepared for you. Didn't even figure I'd meet you here. I would've sought you out, though, because I'm bound to fight. I've decided that much, and I won't be refused. I guess I can be formal, though, um, and say.../Vaguely, I had the idea I would [i]lead[] a troop of my own. Common folks with a common goal, sort of thing? But that's not necessary, or even really relevant, huh? In light of the state of the world. I'll put it simply. I'll say that if.../So, but, I mean. Maybe it won't seem this way, but I'm not normally someone looking to [i]pitch in.[] Or to follow anyone. Or to have anyone follow me. You know? But this is just... I've just kind of seen stuff change. Over the past three years. And I'm sick of it. And, so, if...[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]No, I'll understand if I come off like a tufty-eared bunny who's begging you to make <volunteer.mf:him/her/them> brave. I'm aware of my faults, and I'm sure I'll make [i]you[] aware of them too. But you should know, I'm full of reasons. I've never been so decided on something. And so, if.../No, see, the thing is, I really was [i]meant[] for that life. I've got a traveling heart, and a smile that doesn't rust in the rain. And I sound confident, because I really [i]am.[] But I'll be solider than you think. I won't get knocked over. Or if I do, I'll be up quick. So... I mean, let me formally ask.../[face:skeptical]Naw, I mean, look, I [i]do[] get that you probably turn folks down, if they have my sort of face. [i]I[] probably would. But I'm...
