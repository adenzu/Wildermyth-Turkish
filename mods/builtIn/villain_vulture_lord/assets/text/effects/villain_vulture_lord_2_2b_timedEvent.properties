~01~~panel_002~1_narration=But on the horn of Graymountain \n   sun lasts longer than anywhere else.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=Unwatched, the <legend.mf:old master/lady/master> of that \nplace gathers <legend.mf:his/her/their> forgotten power.
~01~~panel_003~2_legend=[light]You're a [i]trudger[], Captain <hook>.
~01~~panel_003~4_hook=[small]Huh?
~01~~panel_004~4_hook=Oh, I'm... I'll admit I'm not in love with high places. \nIt's a spooky little flock you keep around you.
~01~~panel_005~2_legend=[light]To perch where the light never leaves your shoulder, you must rise over \ntrees, over hills, over your tallest peers. These are them who've dared it.
~01~~panel_006~2_legend=[light][small]Chosen ones, who deserve and desire my favor. You \nmay someday see that I am shrewd in my selections.
~01~~panel_006~4_npc=My <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>...
~01~~panel_007~2_legend=[light]Yet I am unsatisfied.
~01~~panel_007~3_hook=What I wanted to say, though, Vulta... the coin is enough. I don't \nneed convincing. [i]Call[] yourself <legend.mf:a King/Empress/an Emperor>, I'll echo it loud as you like.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=The silver lands glow in the light of late day. \nHigh cold airstreams ripple their clothes.
~01~~panel_009~2_legend=[light]I am in fact [i]ruffled.[] Your tone, \nCaptain <hook>, is rather [i]pink.[]
~01~~panel_010~2_legend=[light]You may mistake me for a strimp. A mealy mountain miser. But stand there.
~01~~panel_010~4_hook=[small]We're... right on the edge...
~01~~panel_011~5_npc=<legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> Vulta! Let us prepare a feast! \nAnd a combat. Just as before.
~01~~panel_012~2_legend=[light]No, Brakken. If the hero <hook> will be my \ncaptain, then <hook.mf:he/she/they> must also be my witness...
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=[light]And so saying, <legend.mf:he/she/Vulta> grims <legend.mf:his/her/their> mouth, breathes into <legend.mf:his/her/their> full frame.
~01~~panel_014~2_narration=[light]Around <legend.mf:him/her/them> rises a burning ring: \n     of wind, of constellated stones, of light.
~01~~panel_015~1_legend=[light]Witness it!
~01~~panel_015~3_narration=[light]Thrumming air. Bitter on the tongue. Biting on their bones.
~01~~panel_015~4_narration=[white]The fact of anything's form begins to wobble.
~01~~panel_016~3_narration=[white]A feathered sound, of wings whumming...
~01~~panel_016~4_narration=[white]The Vulture <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> rises from the cindery crust of <legend.mf:his/her/their> skin.
~01~~panel_016~5_action=[darkGray]...whoom...!
~01~~panel_016~6_action=[maroon]...whoom...!
~01~~panel_017~3_narration=[white]The whipped sky snarls.
~01~~panel_017~4_speech=[light][action]SCREAARGGH!!
~01~~panel_018~2_narration=[white]And <legend.mf:his/her/their> scream bloodies creation.
~01~~panel_020~4_narration=Hope wanders away, no longer at home here.
~01~~panel_020~5_action=[gray][actionSmall]crumple
~01~~panel_021~3_narration=This groan of a world, this blister of a star.
~01~~panel_021~5_npc=[light][small][i]Stand,[] my <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>.
~01~~panel_022~6_hook=And... but...
~01~~panel_022~7_action=[gray][actionSmall]rustle
~01~~panel_023~6_hook=But you... you can simply... [i]do[] that?
~01~~panel_024~2_speech=[light]You [i]see[] now.
~01~~panel_024~3_narration=There's only the smallest falter in <legend.mf:his/her/their> scrowling vulture voice. \nUndetectable, save by the one who served <legend.mf:him/her/them> first.
~01~~panel_025~2_speech=[light]With or without you, I will [i]have[] this land, my homeland. My right is to all that lives and dies upon it, and I will have it all back.
~01~~panel_026~2_speech=[light]For if I wished, I would douse the very torch\nof existence. And fallow every field forever.
~01~~panel_026~5_npc=And that is now proven, my <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>. \nShow mercy upon them. [i]Please.[]
~01~~panel_027~2_speech=[light]Mercy, do you ask for?
~01~~panel_027~5_npc=[small]I beg it.
~01~~panel_028~5_hero2=<hero2.exists:[small]<hero2.bookish/coward/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/60:How... unexpected... how anomalous.../Let's... hey, let's not look at it.../[face:grim]Late for me to say don't [i]stare,[] huh?/[face:neutral]Bet we're in for a <season+1> of bitter news./[face:grim]It's okay.

~01~~panel_029~2_speech=[light]Pitiable things.
~01~~panel_030~1_speech=[light]Mercy, then, I grant you...
~01~~panel_030~2_npc=Stately, <legend.mf:he descends/she descends/they descend>, down the favored path.
~01~~panel_031~4_narration=And the broken light is allowed to mend itself.
~01~~panel_032~3_narration=Wind finds rare brine \n  on Captain <hook>'s cheeks.
~01~~panel_033~1_speech=[light][small]Kwuff...
~01~~panel_034~4_action=[light]stagger!
~01~~panel_034~5_npc=My <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>...!!
~01~~panel_035~2_action=[gray][actionSmall]...shudder...
~01~~panel_035~3_npc=I wish you had held back. Revealing your true countenance is more than enough. Sharing your treasury. Exhibiting the might of your masked faithful...
~01~~panel_036~1_speech=[light]It was... enough... for the other captain. \nThis one... wanted more...
~01~~panel_036~2_action=[gray][actionSmall]...sh-shiverr...
~01~~panel_036~4_npc=[small]You do, of course, know better than I...
~01~~panel_037~1_speech=[light]Good. Anyway, it's good. This \nis how faith is won, Brakken.
~01~~panel_038~4_narration=Brakken helps <npc.mf:his/her/their> embrittled \n  <legend.mf:master/queen/master> stand.
~01~~panel_039~1_speech=[light]Fetch a ferret-sack. I'll only rest in my chamber \nfor a time, and be exactly as I was.
~01~~panel_039~4_npc=[small]Forgive me, <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> Vulta, \nbut it is not how [i]my[] faith--
~01~~panel_041~4_npc=Exactly as you were...

~01~~panel_043~5_hero=<hero2.exists:<hero.personality:[face:interested]Call it ill-luck, but I'll say the opposite. Whatever we saw just now was an extraordinary atmospheric event. It really was./[face:interested]Wild stuff happens. Every year. Doesn't necessarily, uh... [i]portend...[] something... I think?/[face:happy]Maybe it's just a funny old thing that happens sometimes.
