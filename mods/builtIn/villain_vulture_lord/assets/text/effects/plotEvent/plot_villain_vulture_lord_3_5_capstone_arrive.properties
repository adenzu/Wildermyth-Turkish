~01~~panel_001~1_healer=<healer.coward/goofball/hothead/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested]They're sure not hurrying, are they? Look sort of... relaxed./[face:interested]Look at the laggards, moseying along without a care in the world./[face:skeptical]Look at them. Lazy brutes. Not putting much effort into their patrol./Walking kind of leisurely. Could almost imagine they're out on a date.[face:happy]/[face:skeptical]No pep in their step. No swiveling the heads. Who hired these laggards?/No hurry in their step. No urgency.>
~01~~panel_001~2_bookish=<bookish.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/60:[face:interested]So... they can't know we're coming, right?/[face:interested]Wonder if I could plunk one from here? If we weren't trying to be so sneaky.../[face:happy]I'd like to pop the pair of them right here... but I guess I'll have my chance./It's a good sign. It means they don't know we're coming./Think we can assume they don't know we're coming.>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Tracing the mountain's perimeter, even the likeliest way is little guarded. \nThey keep above the road and to its left, ducking behind boulders at \nsound or movement from below.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=The patrols they pass are easily skirted.

~01~~panel_003~3_hothead=<hero.exists:<hero.rfln.hothead:Breathing kind of hard, aren't you?[face:skeptical]/Last mountain we ever climb? \nWhat do you think?[face:skeptical]/[face:talking]You always did like a hike./Least it's not raining.[face:talking]>/Watch it. That's a goat-poop.>
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=Up Graymountain and around wraps the cartroad.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=Until...
~01~~panel_006~1_hothead=<hothead.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/romantic/snark/60:Fairly nondescript front entrance, for the so-called Vulture <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> of Graymountain. I was expecting something more... pompous. Some [i]grandeur.[][face:skeptical]/[face:interested]You know, it's... not as [i]scary[] as I imagined. More of a hole in the rocks than a grim gaping maw. Which... I guess I'm glad? I don't know./[face:joy]Think those outfits would fit us? We'd definitely spook the <town> kids, showing up looking like that!/[face:keptical]It's not where [i]I[] would choose to live, if I was some skyclimbing rich <legend.mf:guy/lady/person>./Not that impressive is it? Not sure what I was expecting, but.../[face:joke]Have to admit, I kind of like the outfits. Maybe if we snag some, we can sneak in, and poison the beer! And it's free clothes!/[face:skeptical]This is [i]it?[] A hole in the mountain with a grate over it? Looks pasted together from leftover dungeonpieces.../Not the most impressive entrance. But maybe our [i]Vulture[] <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> has <legend.mf:his/her/their> own way in?[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_007~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/coward/goofball/60:There's no actually telling what's beyond the gate. Even to me, the legends are overvague.[face:neutral]/There's no telling what's beyond the gate. \nThe legends are still pretty vague, to me.[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]Probably a whole mess of soldiers down that chute. Plus this legend-thing. This [i]Vulta./There's no telling what's beyond the gate. \nThe legends are vague.>
~01~~panel_008~1_healer=And how much of what's in the legends is rooted in truth?
~01~~panel_008~3_hothead=[small]<hothead.goofball/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Hm? Oh./[face:skeptical]Yeah, huh.../[face:grim]Hm./[face:dubious]Heh./[face:interested]Mm.>
~01~~panel_009~3_hothead=But... it's time, I guess.
~01~~panel_010~1_bookish=Yeah. It's time. And, uh, in case any of us...
~01~~panel_011~2_hothead=<hothead.rfln.bookish:[face:neutral]<hothead.hothead.60:[face:skeptical]Oh, save it./Hold up. Stop.>/<hothead.goofball.60:[face:happy]Lives for a thousand years?/[face:neutral]It's alright.>/<hothead.hothead.60:[face:neutral][i]Stop.[]/It's alright.[face:neutral]>/Dies?>

~01~~panel_013~1_hothead=<hothead.rfln.bookish:<hothead.coward/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]You're doing that thing where you freak everyone out. Just... let's, we'll do what we always do. Right?/You don't need to leave me your stuff. It all looks cheap anyway.[face:dubious]/Anyway... who would I throw wet dishrags at \nif you were gone?[face:joke]/[face:neutral]Don't make this a [i]moment.[] Just do what we always do./[face:dubious]Don't get likeable all the sudden./It's okay. If there's anything you need me to forgive you for, I forgive you. Now, are you ready?>/<hothead.coward/goofball/healer/hothead/loner/snark/60:Let's not think like that. Let's just... \nSurvive. We'll survive.[face:interested]/[face:joy]Don't worry! If I croak, just make sure you bury me with the bird<legend.mf:guy/lady/god>!/I know what you're going to say, but... let it go. We'll plan on surviving. How about that?[face:happy]/I'm all for the comrade-stuff, but... \ndon't you just want to get [i]started?[][face:skeptical]/I, uh... No, I mean, I get it. We don't have to say anything.[face:skeptical]/I'm alright, I mean, if it's my time. Just... if I do croak, make sure you bury the bird<legend.mf:guy/lady/god> next to me.[face:dubious]/Let's not have any elegies. We're none of us here to die.[face:neutral]>/<hothead.coward/hothead/loner/romantic/snark/60:I... I don't want to think about life without you. Okay? So please don't make me. Not when I'm supposed to be brave.[face:interested]/You and me, we're going home together. And if fate says otherwise, I'll just have to change its mind.[face:grim]/I... should've said it more often. But. Promise me I'll get more chances. Alright?[face:grim]/[face:happy]We can't always control how it ends. Just, whatever does happen... our lovestory will live forever./I know. And I'm sorry if I made it difficult sometimes. Just, can I selfishly ask...? Don't go before I do.[face:grim]/[face:happy]I know, love. We can't always control how it ends. Let's just try and make it through. If we can.>/I mean... try not to? Or... it was fun while it lasted.[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=A brief tussle, and they gain the entrance.
~01~~panel_014~2_narration=Not far left to go.
