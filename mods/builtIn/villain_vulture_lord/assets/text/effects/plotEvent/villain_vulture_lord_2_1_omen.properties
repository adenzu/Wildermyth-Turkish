~01~~panel_021~1_hero=You heard about the Drauven and Morthagi?
~01~~panel_022~1_hothead=<lover.exists:/Yeah.>
~01~~panel_022~2_lover=<lover.exists:Yeah./>
~01~~panel_023~1_hothead=<hothead.bookish/healer/60:A little baffling, seeing our old enemies turn on each other so... fiercely.

~01~~panel_024~1_hero=Felt that way, too. At first. <hero.coward/goofball/greedy/healer/leader/snark/60:[face:grim]/[face:dubious]/[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:dubious]/>
~01~~panel_025~1_hero=<hero.goofball/snark/60:Course, it's one thing to [i]hear[] that your enemies are beating the snot out of each other./Course, it's always nice to [i]hear[] your enemies are beating the snot out of each other./Course, it'd be one thing if they kept their fighting to the wilds.> But when it's happening on your back doorstep... people get nervous.
~01~~panel_026~1_hero=There was talk of putting together a militia, just in case. I assumed that was the sort of job <hook> had taken.
~01~~panel_027~1_hook=Militia? <hero>, you're adorable. Why'd I want to join the militia?
~01~~panel_028~1_hero=Oh. I mean... I don't know. But it's all anyone's talking about right now.
~01~~panel_029~1_hook=I'm sure it is. Bigger walls and deeper trenches. And a few brave cowhands armed with pitchforks. That's their answer to everything.
~01~~panel_030~1_action=*sigh*
~01~~panel_031~1_hook=But, no. This thing between the Drauven and Morthagi, see... it's not something to wring our hands over. It's an opportunity.
~01~~panel_031~2_hero=How do you figure?
~01~~panel_032~1_hook=Well, people like us, we have certain skills that aren't all that useful in peacetime. What good's knowing how to swing a sword if you don't have anyone to swing it at?
~01~~panel_033~1_hook=And when folk have no more use for us... hungry days can stretch to weeks.
~01~~panel_034~1_hero=<hero.coward/greedy/hothead/snark/60:[face:interested]But there are other things we can... and look, the militia [i]could[] use us./Yeah, I... I've had some rough patches of my own. But, still, the militia [i]could[] use us./Yeah, I get it. But that's... the militia [i]could[] use us./[face:skeptical]Did you miss what I said about the militia? Pretty sure they could use us./But the militia [i]could[] use people like us.>
~01~~panel_035~1_hook=Use us? Sure. Pay us what we're worth? Doubtful. Come on, <hero>. Where's your imagination?
~01~~panel_036~1_hook=Between the two of them, Morthagi have the upper hand. They've got numbers. They're efficient. Move with one mind. I'd give it a few weeks, tops, before they overwhelm the Drauven.
~01~~panel_037~1_hook=The Drauven know it, too. They're desperate. And they'll pay a high price for a good swordarm.
~01~~panel_038~1_hero=The... Drauven?<hero.bookish/greedy/leader/loner/snark/60:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/>
~01~~panel_039~1_hook=Yeah. Why not?
~01~~panel_039~2_hero=You'd fight for [i]them[]?
~01~~panel_040~1_hero=<hero.bookish/greedy/hothead/snark/60:Well, when you say 'the Drauven' I assume you mean the same ones who ambushed our camp last winter. And destroyed Old <folk4>'s farm. How can you justify working alongside them?/Look, I know the money's enticing. I could use more of it myself. But after the things they've done... I just don't see how I could justify working alongside them./Remember what they did to old <folk4>'s farm? Or when they ambushed our camp last winter, and <folk5> lost an arm? How could you justify working alongside them after that?/[face:skeptical]Well, since you ask... because they're murderers and pillagers. Did I mention they kill people? How could you justify working alongside them?/Have you forgotten what they did to Old <folk4>'s farm when we were young? How can you justify working alongside them?>
~01~~panel_041~1_hook=Same way you justified working with the <folk2.lastName> <folk2.mf:brothers/sisters/siblings> when the prairie dogs were running rampant. Common enemy.
~01~~panel_042~1_hook=And Morthagi aren't prairie dogs. What's your point?
~01~~panel_043~1_hero=The <folk2.lastName> <folk2.mf:brothers/sisters/siblings> weren't dangerous marauders.
~01~~panel_044~1_hero=<hero.bookish/greedy/hothead/snark/60:Well, supposing you do help the Drauven win this war, how can you be sure they won't turn around and bare their fangs at [i]us[]?/It's... look, they'll pay you now. They'll cozy up to you. But when it's over, and there's no more Morthagi nipping at their heels, you really think they'll let us alone? Or let [i]you[] walk away?/Point is, they're not trustworthy. You really think they won't turn on us the minute the Morthagi are out of their hair?/[face:skeptical]Isn't it obvious? Finish off the Morthagi, and they'll go looking for someone else to kill. Guess who's next on their list?/Well, I mean... once this thing is over, supposing you help the Drauven win, how long before they bare their fangs at [i]us[]?>
~01~~panel_045~1_hook=That's thoughts for another day. And if the Morthagi won, would it be any different? Not like one side's better than the other.
~01~~panel_046~1_hero=Right. But that's exactly why we should stay out of it. Not pick sides.
~01~~panel_047~1_hook=You still don't get it. I couldn't care less who wins. I'm just lending my services to the higher bidder.
~01~~panel_048~1_hook=Look, <hero>. You don't want in? That's fine. I was only trying to do you a favor. See you around, I guess.
~01~~panel_049~1_hook=[small]<folk3>! Got a table with my name on it?
~01~~panel_050~1_hero=After that... a lot of things changed. Morthagi were driven back, but not defeated. More and more, the fighting started crossing into people's lands, farms...
~01~~panel_051~1_hero=Instead of dwindling, the armies swelled...
~01~~panel_052~1_hero=...with human soldiers, fighting for both sides.
~01~~panel_053~1_lover=<lover.exists:Morthagi too? <lover.goofball/greedy/snark/60:Imagine talking coin with one of those bonebuckets./Imagine talking coin with one of those bonebuckets./Imagine talking coin with one of those bonebuckets./That's... got to make for some unusual negotiations.>/>

~01~~panel_054~1_hero=I tried to find out more. Who was hiring them, how they were organized. That's when I landed myself in trouble. Some men with axes chased me out of town.
~01~~panel_055~1_hero=<hero.bookish/coward/greedy/60:I understand it's their livelihood. And unpleasant tasks are often the most lucrative./I guess to them it's just a job, one that pays well in spite of the dangers. Or [i]because[] of the dangers./Look, I understand why they're doing it. The pay's good. And they want to keep it going as long as possible./It's just a job to them. I get that.> But while they're fattening their purses, things are getting uglier. Those of us who won't pick a side find ourselves stuck in the middle.
~01~~panel_056~1_hero=Didn't know what to do, until I remembered you and <company>, how you took care of that Deepist problem a few years back. I thought, maybe, you could talk to the mercenaries--
~01~~panel_056~2_hothead=<hero>...
~01~~panel_058~1_hothead=<hothead.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:I don't think a bunch of seasoned mercenaries will lay down their arms just because I ask them to./I doubt a bunch of overgrown mercenary types are going to stop what they're doing just because [i]I[] say so./[face:skeptical]If they're getting paid [i]half[] of what I'd ask for that sort of work, I doubt any words of mine will persuade them to stop./Not sure words will get us anywhere with people like them./I doubt I'd be able to persuade them, if you couldn't./[face:skeptical]These are people who kill things for a living. Don't think talking it out is going to bear much fruit./I doubt a few words from me--or any of us--will be enough to make them set aside their profits.>
~01~~panel_059~1_hothead=<hothead.coward/goofball/loner/snark/60:But staying here won't help, either. And if there's a chance of finding a peaceful solution, I'm willing to give it a try./But, hey, a lot of strange things have happened. I'm willing to give it a try./But I'm willing to go with you, and see if there's anything that [i]can[] be done to bring this conflict to an end./But I admit, I'm curious. And if there is a way to bring the conflict to an end, well, I'll see what I can do./But if there's anything that [i]can[] be done to bring the conflict to an end, I'm willing to try it.> <lover.exists:How about you, <lover>?/Shouldn't be hard to convince the others, too.>
~01~~panel_060~2_bookish=<bookish.coward/goofball/hothead/poet/snark/60:So, uh... when do we take our first break?/[face:talking]Oof. More walking, huh? Well that's fine. Pants were getting a bit tight, anyway./[face:happy]Anyone want to race me to the signpost? No?/The crunch of gravel underfoot. The shimmer of rainkissed fields. I forgot how much I missed this./[face:dubious]Ah, yes, more walking. How I've missed this./Didn't realize how much I missed this.>
