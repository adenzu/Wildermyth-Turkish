~01~~panel_001~1_darken=This sprawling valley.
~01~~panel_001~2_darken=These towering peaks.
~01~~panel_001~3_darken=You feel the shape of them in your blood.
~01~~panel_002~2_darken=They are as they were, when life was young.
~01~~panel_002~3_darken=When the first of our people set foot upon the untilled soil.
~01~~panel_003~1_darken=Those were cold days. Stumbling days.
~01~~panel_003~2_darken=But we were not alone.
~01~~panel_004~1_darken=There were beasts of the earth...
~01~~panel_005~1_darken=...of lake and stream...
~01~~panel_006~1_darken=...of the sky...
~01~~panel_007~1_darken=...and other shapeless things...
~01~~panel_008~1_darken=...both willful and strange.
~01~~panel_009~2_darken=Some came with friendship. Others with mischief.
~01~~panel_009~3_darken=And one day, over our lowly \nhovels swooped Vulture.
~01~~panel_010~1_darken=<legend.mf:He was/She was/They were> known to us by name and rumor.
~01~~panel_010~2_darken=Cunning. Capricious. [i]Covetous.[]
~01~~panel_010~3_darken=The mighty Sunthief.
~01~~panel_011~1_darken=Insatiable in <legend.mf:his/her/their> appetites, <legend.mf:he/she/they> conquered and devoured, \nand thirsted after all that shone and sparkled.
~01~~panel_011~3_darken=Jewels and gems and stars and moon.
~01~~panel_012~1_darken=And most of all, <legend.mf:he/she/they> desired the sun.
~01~~panel_013~1_darken=So up to the sky's very rim <legend.mf:he/she/they> soared.
~01~~panel_013~2_darken=And with <legend.mf:his/her/their> beak <legend.mf:he/she/they> tore it down, \nand carried it back to <legend.mf:his/her/their> mountain.
~01~~panel_014~1_darken=Then the sun shone only at Vulture's whim, \nand the land fell into bitter winter.
~01~~panel_015~1_darken=And in the midst of our mourning...
~01~~panel_015~2_darken=So it was when we came to the valley.
~01~~panel_015~3_darken=Cruel winds froze the blood in our veins. \nLong nights stole our children and our old.
~01~~panel_016~1_darken=Vulture appeared.
~01~~panel_017~1_darken=<legend.mf:He/She/They> claimed us as <legend.mf:his/her/their> subjects. And <legend.mf:he/she/they> offered us \na span of sunshine. A warm and prosperous year.
~01~~panel_017~2_darken=In return, we would pay <legend.mf:him/her/them> tribute: \nthe corpses of our dead.
~01~~panel_018~1_darken=We refused.
~01~~panel_019~1_darken=Incensed, Vulture spread <legend.mf:his/her/their> wings and departed.
~01~~panel_020~1_darken=But when we lay asleep, <legend.mf:he/she/they> returned...
~01~~panel_020~2_darken=...clutching in <legend.mf:his/her/their> talons a lick of sunflame.
~01~~panel_021~2_darken=It burgeoned into a mighty blaze...
~01~~panel_022~1_darken=...and consumed all that we had built.
~01~~panel_024~1_darken=But courage, sometimes, \n    is born from great anguish...
~01~~panel_026~2_healer=<healer.bookish/healer/poet/romantic/coward/snark/60:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:dubious]/>Mmm.
~01~~panel_026~3_npc2=Think that was the end of the old bird?
~01~~panel_027~2_npc2=So did our ancestors. Actually...
~01~~panel_028~3_npc2=[darkRed][i]Flames charred <legend.mf:his/her/their> flesh and melted <legend.mf:his/her/their> feathers. But the malice, so pure and pungent, which dwelt in Vulture's heart, would not perish. Gnarled and misshapen, <legend.mf:he/she/they> arose, hissing <legend.mf:his/her/their> hate and vowing revenge!
~01~~panel_030~2_npc2=Imagine. Being too [i]hateful[] to die like a normal thing.
~01~~panel_031~2_npc2=<legend.mf:He's/She's/They're> a regular pest in lots of the old stories. \nAlways popping up to eat us and steal our joy.
~01~~panel_032~1_npc2=My Nan had a big old book of stuff like that. Rocked me to sleep with it.
~01~~panel_033~1_npc2=Always liked a talking animal.
~01~~panel_034~1_healer=<healer.themePiece_crow_head:[face:dubious]/<healer.themePiece_frog_head:[face:dubious]/<healer.themePiece_wolf_head:[face:dubious]/>>>
~01~~panel_035~3_healer=And... there. That should do it.
~01~~panel_036~1_npc2=I'd gotten sort of used to the old drip-drop. [small]Wonder if I'll miss it...[] Hey, you good with doors?
~01~~panel_037~1_healer=<healer.bookish/healer/hothead/leader/60:Have you considered finding a regular housemender for work like this?/Sorry, I'm... of course I'm glad to help, but... you don't have a regular housemender for this kind of work?/Uh, sure, but... don't you have a regular housemender for stuff like this?/Sorry, I'm... of course I'm glad to help, but... you don't have a regular housemender for this kind of work?/It's... uh... none of my business, maybe, but don't you have a regular housemender for stuff like this?>
~01~~panel_038~1_npc2=Out here? I'm lucky if I see the same face twice, much less an odd-jobber. First it was the floods, now it's rumors of kidnappers and beastworshipers. Not a lot of folks willing to risk the road.
~01~~panel_038~2_actionSmall=[white]hop!
~01~~panel_039~2_healer=How about those two?
~01~~panel_039~3_npc2=Just get the adventuring types, mostly... not that I'm complaining. Get to meet some real heroes sometimes. Why, soon as I saw [i]you[], I thought--
~01~~panel_040~1_healer=<healer.loner/snark/60:[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/>
~01~~panel_040~2_npc2=Whuh?
~01~~panel_041~1_narration=The dusty roads that stitch this yondering together are riddled with inns like <npc2>'s.
~01~~panel_041~2_narration=Here weary feet can stall while empty bellies are filled and words are traded.
~01~~panel_041~3_narration=News and rumor, tale and song. Like seeds lodged in a traveler's shoe, they take root wherever they're dropped.
~01~~panel_042~3_npc2=You're up from the river towns? Can you tell me if crusty <child> ever finished <child.mf:his/her/their> new windmill? Did you see it? Is it bigger than before?
~01~~panel_042~4_hothead=[small]...erm.
~01~~panel_043~3_npc2=Don't worry, you'll get a chance to tell me all about it! I'll go ready the rooms...!
~01~~panel_044~3_npc2=Three heroes meet at an inn... Sounds like the start of one of Nan's stories.
~01~~panel_045~3_bookish=[gray]<bookish.healer/loner/romantic/snark/60:Imagine it's lonely work, running a place like this./Quiet place. Far from anything.[face:neutral]/Must get lonely, this far from anyone./Lonely places like this... can't help wondering about the people who run them.../Lonely life, probably. Running a place like this. Miles from anything.>
~01~~panel_046~2_healer=<healer.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/hothead/poet/snark/60:[face:interested]Job? Not the word I would use, precisely. Been traveling a few seasons, hoping to see more of the world... to [i]experience[] more. Work is something I take where I find./[face:interested]Oh, uh, you mean patching <npc2>'s roof? Wasn't really on purpose. Just... passing through. And figured it's best to take what work comes to me./Yeah, I mean, not any [i]particular[] job. But when my pockets are empty, I'll take work where it's offered./Wouldn't say that, exactly. <npc2> was just telling me about <npc2.mf:his/her/their> leaky roof, and I figure it's good practice to take work where it's offered./What, you mean the roof-fixing? Just fell in my lap. Never been one to turn down work when it's offered./[face:skeptical]Job? Not the word I would use, precisely. I've been travelling... somewhat aimlessly, actually, for a season or two. And between the empty, uninhabited spaces, I take what work is offered./[face:skeptical]Well, if you call roof-patching a job. Really, I just take whatever work comes my way. Not much of it, around here./No, not... exactly. I've been on the road for at least a season. If I find work, I take it. Don't have the luxury of being choosey.>
~01~~panel_046~4_hothead=<hothead.coward/loner/romantic/60:So, uh... you here on a job, too?/You, uh... here on a job, too?/You don't dress like one of the locals. Here on a job, too?/Here on a job, too?>
~01~~panel_047~2_hothead=[gray]<hothead.hothead/loner/snark/60:How about it, <hothead.rfln.bookish:<bookish>/<bookish>/love/<bookish>>?/[face:skeptical]I don't know, <hothead.rfln.bookish:<bookish>/<bookish>/love/<bookish>>, you think...?/[face:skeptical]Well, <hothead.rfln.bookish:<bookish>/<bookish>/love/<bookish>>? That face tells me you've got an opinion./What are [i]you[] thinking, <hothead.rfln.bookish:<bookish>/<bookish>/love/<bookish>>?>
~01~~panel_047~3_bookish=[gray]<bookish.bookish/coward/healer/loner/60:It's said that those who desire help had best start by asking for it./Three stand a better chance than two. Doesn't hurt to ask, anyway./I wouldn't say no to help. Job like this, we'll probably need it./Guess asking for help is smarter than not./May as well ask. No harm in that.>
~01~~panel_048~4_narration=Their story isn't all new to <healer>. Cultists have plagued the people of these lands as far back as <healer.mf:he remembers/she remembers/they remember>. And lately, it seems every new sun brings another grim tale of their doings. Abductions, pilferings, and worse.
~01~~panel_048~5_narration=The faces <healer.mf:he meets/she meets/they meet> on the road are too often clouded with fear and mistrust.
~01~~panel_049~1_hothead=<hothead.bookish/coward/greedy/poet/60:What they can't pillage, they destroy.\nNo respect for life, or craft, or art./[face:sad]Old <parent> was a brave <parent.mf:man/lady/person>. Tried to save some of <parent.mf:his/her/their> sheep.\nIt... didn't end well./[face:angry]Old <parent> had built <parent.mf:his/her/their> ranch up from nothing. Took pride in <parent.mf:his/her/their> sheep, wouldn't let them be carried off. It... didn't end well./[face:angry]What they can't pillage, they destroy.\nNo respect for life, or craft, or art./Old<parent.mf: man/ lady/> <parent> tried to stop them making off with <parent.mf:his/her/their> sheep.\nIt didn't end pretty.>
~01~~panel_050~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/coward/poet/60:[face:grim]It's not limited to the roads, anymore. Homesteads have been ransacked. Places like this./[face:interested]Roads haven't been safe a long time. But now, they've started attacking farms and outposts... places like this./[face:grim]It's not limited to the roads, anymore. Homesteads have been ransacked. Places like this./It's not just the roads, anymore. There's been farms attacked... and places like this.>
~01~~panel_051~1_hothead=So the river people tried putting a company together. Hiring folks to patrol the roads, root out the cultists. We were the only volunteers.
~01~~panel_051~2_healer=[small]Mm. And you're wondering if I--
~01~~panel_052~1_npc2=Okay, who's ready to see my collection?
~01~~panel_053~1_healer=<healer.coward/goofball/healer/leader/60:[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_054~1_npc2=That one in the middle's <volunteer2.fullName>. Passed through a few years ago and let me take <volunteer2.mf:his/her/their> sketch. Really captured <volunteer2.mf:his/her/their> fierceness, don't you think?
~01~~panel_055~1_npc2=Then there's <friend>, and <ship>. And of course \nthe amazing <volunteer.fullName>.
~01~~panel_056~1_npc2=My wall of heroes, I call it. Always looking for new additions.
~01~~panel_057~1_hothead=<hothead.goofball/romantic/60:[face:happy]/[face:happy]/Uh... no thanks.>
~01~~panel_058~1_npc2=Want me to show you which beds they slept in?
~01~~panel_059~1_narration=By a crackling hearth, plans are settled.
~01~~panel_059~2_hothead=<hothead.coward/loner/snark/60:[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]/>
~01~~panel_059~4_healer=<healer.personality:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]//[face:interested]///////>
~01~~panel_060.(lover_exists)~1_narration=And the sparks of fated flames start to fly.
~01~~panel_061~3_npc2=Saving a spot on my wall all for you, <healer>! Don't forget!
~01~~panel_062~6_hothead=<hothead.bookish/greedy/loner/poet/60:A few seasons on the road, with no destination in mind? Imagine you must have some [i]stories[] to tell?/Alright.[face:skeptical] So what's your big thing? What're you most [i]after[] in this world?/[face:grim]Simpler life, huh. Not being rooted in one place. That what called you to the road?/Decaying ruins under a starlit sky. Wild places steeped in mystery. Your travels ever take you to unexpected places?/So, out of all the jobs you've taken, what's the weirdest?>
