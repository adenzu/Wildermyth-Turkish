~01~~panel_001.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_narration=Meanwhile, in the depths of Graymountain...
~01~~panel_001.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~3_hook2=[small]...an overconfident collection of ribs \nand femurs, bedecked in flimsy armor...!
~01~~panel_002.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_hook2=Put up a good fight, for lizard things, but nothing \nmy clever little pets couldn't handle...
~01~~panel_003.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_hook2=De-limbed their commander myself! Just another second-rate mercenary, no fiber on <hook.mf:his/her/their> bones.
~01~~panel_003.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_legend=[light]And what of the hero, <hook.fullname>, who led them?\n[small]Or... nevermind, I suppose you'll claim you--
~01~~panel_004.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_hook2=Fairly disappointing, how quick we won. But a free-minded force will fold when blood starts to pour. That's why, didn't I tell you I'd come out on top?
~01~~panel_004.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_legend=[light]Repeatedly.
~01~~panel_005.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_hook2=You're a person of some intellect, <legend.mf:Master/Lady/Master> Vulta. You'll have recognized, by now, that my creations, my stratagems... they're faultless. Even this body of mine rarely slows!
~01~~panel_006.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]Hm. Well, at present...
~01~~panel_007.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_hook2=You'll have taken to me. Seen how crucial I am to you. So \njust know, I'm pleased to accept my place as your general. \nYou can tell me who you want dead, and they'll surely die!
~01~~panel_008.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]Ick!
~01~~panel_009.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_action=[orange]...clrrng...
~01~~panel_011.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_action=[actionSmall][darkOrange]clip!
~01~~panel_011.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_action=[actionSmall][darkRed]clrONk!
~01~~panel_012.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]What's [i]that[] doing here?
~01~~panel_012.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_hook2=Oh, they do like to wander. But as I was saying...
~01~~panel_013.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]Yes, yes, don't restate it. You've done well, \nCaptain <hook2>. Captain Barrengast.
~01~~panel_013.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_hook2=<legend.mf:Master/Lady/Master> Vulta, that's all I needed to hear. In truth, I knew from the moment you \noutlined to me your particular stipulations... that we would be a perfect match.
~01~~panel_014.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]It's [i]<legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>[] Vulta.
~01~~panel_014.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_hook2=<legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>, then. Should I be circumspect? I mean only that we each have a [i]use[] for the \nflotsam of the battlefield, but we don't covet the same... [i]bounty.[] Same resource.
~01~~panel_015.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]How many armies have you led?
~01~~panel_015.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_hook2=Hm? Ah. I've led my band a longish time.\nShrinking, swelling. [i]No one's[] led an ar--
~01~~panel_016.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]Conquest is about feeding your hunger. It needs an appetite as big as the land you lay hold of. My hunger has never flagged, as long as this world has turned. Consider, [i]Captain,[] whether your stomach might confine even the mountains, even the [i]sun,[] before you presume to compare us.
~01~~panel_018.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]You are my captain, and will be called such, until the day I go unresisted in my own territory.
~01~~panel_019.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~3_hook2=But <legend.mf:Mas--/La--/Mas-->[i]<legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> Vulta.[] Surely I should be confirmed as... shouldn't I be [i]called...[]
~01~~panel_020.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]But yes. When the hour comes to bring about the fullness of my reign, to dictate the span my wings will shadow... then [i]you[] will be at my army's head. The Arm of Vulta. The Voracious Claw.
~01~~panel_021.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]Now go to your troop. Bid them wait. True ambition, you may tell them, is proven with patience.
~01~~panel_021.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_hook2=As you command, <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>.
~01~~panel_022.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]And be sure to take your wayward pet with you.
~01~~panel_024.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_npc=<legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> Vulta?
~01~~panel_025.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_npc=Do you think we can trust <hook2.mf:him/her/them>?
~01~~panel_027.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]<hook2.mf:He/She/They> may look like some toolshed contraption, but underneath that ridiculous veneer, <hook2.mf:his/her/their> heart beats human blood.
~01~~panel_028.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]Quite.
~01~~panel_028.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_npc=Treacherous blood. Thankless blood.
~01~~panel_029.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]The <hook2.mf:man/woman/person> disgusts me. As do the meatless creatures <hook2.mf:he commands/she commands/they command>.
~01~~panel_030.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light][small]To the [i]bracken,[] is it?
~01~~panel_030.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~3_narration=Meanwhile, in the depths of Graymountain...
~01~~panel_030.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~4_hook=[small]...so they've scattered to the bracken. And to places\nbeneath the hills, where bones should anyways be.
~01~~panel_031.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]Mm. But how about their captain?
~01~~panel_031.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~3_hook=Old Barrengast? Dead in a cave somewhere.\nNot my doing, sadly, or I'd be boasting about it.
~01~~panel_032.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]The work of the countryfolks. Don't you suppose? \nThey're more [i]rugged[] than I'd have thought.
~01~~panel_033.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~3_hook=[face:grim]Can't be. I know these people.\nThey're tough as daisies.
~01~~panel_034.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_legend=[light]How has your force behaved?
~01~~panel_035.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_legend=[light]It's endless trouble, satisfying them.
~01~~panel_036.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~3_hook=They're a lot of fun.
~01~~panel_036.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~6_speech=[actionSmall][light]Food. Also metal. Our deserve is more.
~01~~panel_037.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_legend=[light]Mmm.
~01~~panel_037.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~3_hook=They fight hard. And they don't weasel around for other offers. \nBetter to have them on my side than on the other. Is still my feeling.
~01~~panel_038.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_legend=[light]I suppose we must remember to feed our Drauven, then, Captain <hook>.
~01~~panel_038.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~7_hook=Yes, my <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>.
~01~~panel_039.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_legend=[light]As for you, you've taken my lesson on the summit, and followed the only path open to you. I'm pleased with the results, to this point.
~01~~panel_040.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_legend=[light]When my armies are ready to pour from this mountain, I count on you to lead them. In reverence and dread your name shall be spoken. <hook>, the Sword of Vulta, the Mighty Arm, [i]the Delectable Muscle...
~01~~panel_041.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_legend=[light]Yes. I do. Now go. Take your allies and... busy them with beer. Or whatever your pleasures might be.
~01~~panel_041.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~3_hook=You honor me, <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> Vulta.
~01~~panel_043.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_npc=My <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>.
~01~~panel_044.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]Daisies and dandelions. \n[small]Return... year after year...
~01~~panel_045.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_npc=My <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>, do you think we can trust <hook.mf:him/her/them>?
~01~~panel_047.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]The <hook.mf:man/woman/person> would stick a sword in <hook.mf:his/her/their> favorite puppy for the right price. So, yes, I trust <hook.mf:him/her/them>... to act as humans do.
~01~~panel_048.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]Quite.
~01~~panel_048.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~2_npc=Thankless thieving wolves.
~01~~panel_049.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_legend=[light]As for those scaly knobs who slither at <hook.mf:his/her/their> side... they will snatch at any fly that ventures too near their noses. Take care, <npc>.
~01~~panel_050~2_legend=[light]But when you pit the viper against the wolf, it matters little which comes out the victor. \nBoth have their fangs... and fangs are all I need them for. So ends my little game.
~01~~panel_052~2_npc=[small]I [i]do[] wonder sometimes...
~01~~panel_053~1_legend=[light]What's that? If you will speak, <npc>, then [i]speak[].
~01~~panel_054~1_npc=Yes, my <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>, I... I have seen the marks that time leaves, on the faces of beasts, on the shape of rivers. I only wondered... if the long years of your imprisonment did not alter...
~01~~panel_055~1_npc=...but you never speak of that time.
~01~~panel_056~1_legend=[light]No? I did not think you would care to hear the maudlin tale of how I passed my bleakest days.
~01~~panel_057~1_npc=I... I only...
~01~~panel_058~1_legend=[light]Weak. Alone. [i]Famished[]. Like my innards had been scraped out \nwith a spoon. Empty as a hollowed gourd. That's how it felt.
~01~~panel_059~1_legend=[light]I had no aim, at first. Only hateful persistence.\nI spent a century or two languishing in despair.
~01~~panel_059~2_speech=[light]Until the thought possessed me. To learn.
~01~~panel_060~1_legend=[light]To live [i]as[] them. [i]Among[] them. To bend my mouth and speak their folksy phrases.
~01~~panel_060~2_speech=[light] I did an exceptional  job of it, naturally.
~01~~panel_061~1_legend=[light][i]Too[] exceptional, perhaps.
~01~~panel_061~2_speech=[light]My memories... of feather and fire... grew elusive, teasing.
~01~~panel_061~3_speech=[light]I forgot the caress of wind on my wings, could not fathom the freedom of the sky.
~01~~panel_062~1_legend=[light]Trapped in this powerless shell, humanity festered in my veins.
~01~~panel_062~2_legend=[light]Almost I believed that I [i]was[] human. Except that I did not die.
~01~~panel_063~1_legend=[light]Those were the worst days.
~01~~panel_064~2_npc=My <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>, you... you shall never be made to suffer so again. I swear it on my...
~01~~panel_065~1_legend=[light]Yes, yes. But at the moment...
~01~~panel_066~1_legend=[light]At the moment, I am more concerned with collecting my debts.
~01~~panel_067~1_legend=[light]Many, many lifetimes... of debts...
