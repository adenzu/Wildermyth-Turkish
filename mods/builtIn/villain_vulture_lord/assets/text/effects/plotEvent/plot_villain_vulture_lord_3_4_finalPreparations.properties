~01~~panel_001~1_narration=<subPlot.exists:<subPlot2.exists:<subPlot3.exists:<subject.exists:Some of them have/They've all>/A couple of them have>/<subPlot> has> been up in the mountain before./A way into the mountain was known to them.>
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=<subPlot.exists:<subPlot2.exists:With a few false steps, they remember the turns./<subPlot.mf:He leads the others. He remembers the turns./She leads the others. She remembers the turns./They lead the others. They remember the turns.>>/And that is where they look to go.>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Meanwhile, in the woods, \nwhere they left Brakken tied...
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Time trickles on. Day blends with night. Years with decades. Measurement is futile in face of the infinite.
~01~~panel_003~2_narration=But there are some memories that live in the mind, undulled by the ages that pass between.
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=<npc.mf:He was/She was/They were> truly young, then. The ungainly runt of an otherwise prosperous litter. More than any of them, <npc.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> known the wind's bite. The despair of a starless night. And so, more than any of them, <npc.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> loved the dawn and day.
~01~~panel_004~3_narration=<npc.mf:He was/She was/They were> simple. Complaisant. Ruled by no great ambition. Only a dog's desire to please.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=They laid their plans without <npc.mf:him/her/them>, and <npc.mf:he/she/they> harbored no suspicion.
~01~~panel_005~3_narration=When the day came for their <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord> to claim <legend.mf:his/her/their> tribute...
~01~~panel_010~1_folk3=Out of the way!
~01~~panel_011~1_folk1=Stop it! Why!?
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=It wasn't courage, in that moment.
~01~~panel_012~2_narration=It was devotion.
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=A devotion that blotted out fear and thought.
~01~~panel_013~2_narration=Compelled <npc.mf:him/her/them> to defy <npc.mf:his/her/their> own blood.
~01~~panel_014~2_narration=The price... <npc.mf:he/she/they>'d had no time to consider.
~01~~panel_018~1_speech=[light]Fragile beast... wake up. Your heart beats again.
~01~~panel_019~1_speech=[light]You have proved yourself true.
~01~~panel_020~1_speech=[light]Worthy of the greatest gift.
~01~~panel_021~1_folk1=<legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> Vulta? You were... I was...
~01~~panel_021~2_legend=[light]Dead?
~01~~panel_022~1_legend=[light]Your foolish brethren thought so. But you were not beyond [i]my[] call.
~01~~panel_022~2_folk1=[small]I... I do not remember...
~01~~panel_023~1_legend=[light]This light. Did you know that I captured it, long ago? A beakful of sun's flame, torn from the sky. The prize of my daring. The source of my eternal life.
~01~~panel_024~1_legend=[light]And now, the [i]smallest piece[] \nof it... resides in you.
~01~~panel_025~1_folk1=A piece of... the sun...
~01~~panel_026~1_legend=[light]No lesser magic would mend you.
~01~~panel_027~2_narration=Only as <npc.mf:his/her/their> eyes grew accustomed to the glare of that light...
~01~~panel_027~3_narration=...did <npc> perceive the extent...
~01~~panel_027~4_narration=...of what had come to pass.
~01~~panel_028~2_folk1=My <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>, your... [i]face...[]
~01~~panel_030~1_legend=[light]I look like [i]you,[] don't I? My beak, my feathers... the traitors' flames stripped me of my beauty. And as I bent my powers to saving you, I somehow slipped into this... this [i]thing[].
~01~~panel_031~1_legend=[light]A consequence of the bond we now share, perhaps.
~01~~panel_031~2_folk1=The...? <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> Vulta, do you really mean...?
~01~~panel_032~1_legend=[light]My body wobbles as if it were formed of jelly. These arms will not allow me to fly no matter how I flap them. But it will be a pittance of years. The sun shall restore me to what I was. And in the meantime, Brrr... Brode. Brodog?
~01~~panel_033~1_legend=[light]Bracken? Were you named for the hare-hiding plantgrowth?
~01~~panel_033~2_folk1=Ah. [i]Brakken,[] I am called.
~01~~panel_034~1_folk1=Well, not ex... <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> <legend>, why would you have...?
~01~~panel_035~1_legend=[light]Because, loyal <npc>. I know you will never betray me.
~01~~panel_036~1_narration=A piercing shriek jolts <npc.mf:him/her/them> from half sleep.
~01~~panel_037~2_action=[light][actionSmall]...rustle...
~01~~panel_037~3_action=[orange][actionSmall]snick!
~01~~panel_039~1_npc=It's just as the saying goes: [i]Clever birds make quick work of knotted ropes!
~01~~panel_041~1_npc=Now come. Lead me home.
~01~~panel_043~1_bookish=<bookish.coward/goofball/hothead/romantic/60:See? I wasn't worrying for nothing...[face:grim]/Thank you, <legend.mf:Lord/Lady/Lord> Buzzard! I was hoping for a nap![face:joy]/That buzzard's afraid of us, I guess.[face:happy]/Break out the wine, I guess. I'm footsore.[face:dubious]/Kind of figured. Ah well. Here's a good place to stop.>
~01~~panel_043~2_hothead=<hothead.vulture_metSidekick:Well, it's blocked. The way we went before. \nIt would've been here./The path's blocked.>
~01~~panel_043~4_healer=Chance to get our gear in order. Right?
