~01~~panel_001~3_narration=Dust settles. A tomb's silence falls.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Caves and tunnels branch away from the prophet's hall.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=A labyrinth cluttered with odorous \nofferings and scatterscratch sigils.
~01~~panel_004~2_npc=Word of their prophet's fall must \ntravel fast. All seems deserted.
~01~~panel_005~2_hothead=Hmm.
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=<hothead.vulture_sawDoor:It's the walls of these chambers, more than the Deepist rubble, that hold <hothead>'s attention. Where there seemed to be a gap, before.../In the flicker of torchlight, the strangely shapen walls arrest <hothead>'s attention. Portions that are too smooth, too symmetrical.>
~01~~panel_006~2_hothead=<hothead.vulture_sawDoor:Just a wall, I guess.../Almost wonder...>
~01~~panel_007~1_npc=Have we not searched enough? <bookish.exists:You must be \nlonging to turn your feet homeward./[face:grim]We have our dead to see to. I can lead the way...>
~01~~panel_008~1_bookish=<bookish.exists:<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]<deadHero.2.exists:<deadHero.3.exists:<deadHero.1>, <deadHero.2>, <deadHero.3>... let's carry them/<deadHero.1> and <deadHero.2>... let's carry them>/Let's carry <deadHero>> out of here./<bookish.goofball/healer/hothead/snark/60:[face:interested]You don't need help scrubbing all this cultist gunk off your dining room floor?/[face:interested]Oh, but... we made such a mess in here. If you'd like help cleaning it up.../What, already? You won't need help clearing out all this cultist junk?/[face:interested]Oh, sure. Home. Just... it's going to take some scrubbing to get rid of all this cultist gunk. You won't need help?/Something of a mess in here. You don't want help cleaning it up?>>/>
~01~~panel_008~2_hothead=<bookish.exists:/Do you need my help? With the clean up? All these bodies? I... \nI should take them home. <deadHero.3.exists:<deadHero.4.exists:<deadHero.4>, /><deadHero.3>, /><deadHero.2>, <deadHero.1>...[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_008~3_hothead=<bookish.exists:<deadHero.exists:Mm. Brakken, do you need us to help? \nWith the clean up? All these bodies...[face:grim]/>/>
~01~~panel_009~1_npc=<deadHero.exists:<bookish.exists:[face:grim]No, no. After what you have already lost, I couldn't possibly. And my/[face:grim][hothead.face:grim]Please, that's grim enough work for one <hothead.mf:man/woman/person>. And anyway... my>/Oh, no, no. You've already done all that could be asked. And my> <legend.mf:lord/lady/lord> is so [i]very []particular. I will handle the rest.
~01~~panel_010~1_hothead=<hothead.bookish/leader/loner/60:Your <legend.mf:lord/lady/lord>... I don't suppose <bookish.exists:we'll/I'll> have a chance to meet <legend.mf:him/her/them>?/Very well. And will <bookish.exists:we/I> have a chance to meet your <legend.mf:lord/lady/lord>?/[face:skeptical]Oh, right, your <legend.mf:lord/lady/lord>. Uh, <bookish.exists:are we/am I> supposed to meet <legend.mf:him/her/him>?/Right, your <legend.mf:lord/lady/lord>. Any chance <bookish.exists:we'll/I'll> be able to meet <legend.mf:him/her/them>?>
~01~~panel_011~1_npc=I'm afraid that would be quite impossible. <legend.mf:He is/She is/They are> unwell.
~01~~panel_012~1_npc=But the mountain will heal <legend.mf:him/her/them>, as it ever has. Soon\n<legend.mf:he/she/they> will be <legend.mf:his/her/their> old self again. Yes, <legend.mf:his/her/their> old self...
~01~~panel_012~3_healer=<healer.exists:[small]The [i]mountain...?[]/>
~01~~panel_013~2_npc=Come, I will show you out.
~01~~panel_014~1_healer=<healer.exists:But... even the Deepist bodies? <healer.coward/hothead/loner/snark/60:Kind of gross. Shouldn't we... help you bury them?[face:interested]/[face:talking]I'm an impressive digger, you know?/I can help. Dig some holes, at least./[face:skeptical]Could at least toss them out the door.../[face:interested]We could at least dig some holes...>/>
~01~~panel_014~2_hothead=<healer.exists:/<bookish.exists:We'll/I'll> come back. Help you bury these... bodies...>
~01~~panel_016~1_npc=Not necessary.
~01~~panel_016~2_hothead=<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_018~1_npc=Be off and be well.
~01~~panel_018~2_hothead=<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]Same to you. Or... be [i]here,[] I suppose./<season+1>'ll come soon. <hothead.loner/snark/60:Doubt I'll \nhike this mountain again.[face:neutral]/[face:talking]If it's as crummy as <season-1>, maybe we'll have to live up here too, before long./The land'll be better traveled. Come see the valleys, when you can.>>
~01~~panel_019~1_narration=<deadHero.exists:It will be a long road back. Regret and grief mingle with triumph.[npc.face:grim]/It will be a long road back, but their steps are lightened by thoughts of what lies ahead.>
~01~~panel_019~2_hothead=<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_019~3_bookish=<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_020~1_narration=<bookish.exists:/<hothead.mf:His/Her/Their> friends will be remembered. <hothead.mf:He'll/She'll/They'll> see to that.\nThere'll be a return to lazy days and simple living. >
~01~~panel_020~2_narration=<bookish.exists:/For others, if not for <hothead.mf:him/her/them>.>
~01~~panel_020~3_narration=From high up, <bookish.exists:they/<hothead>> can see all the land. Gray in the pale light.
~01~~panel_020~4_bookish=<bookish.exists:<healer.exists:[small]Probably getting supper ready./[small]Warm meal. Soft pillow. It'll be good.>/>
~01~~panel_020~5_hothead=<bookish.exists:[small]Is that <npc2>'s chimney down there?/>
~01~~panel_020~6_healer=<healer.exists:[small]<healer.goofball/greedy/loner/romantic/60:Forget supper. Just give me some bread 'n' jam./Mmm. Could do with some gemberry pie, myself./Just want a nice, soft pillow, myself./Just want a good bath, myself./Warm meal. Nothing like it.>/>
~01~~panel_025~1_npc=My <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>?
~01~~panel_026~1_legend=[light]<npc>.
~01~~panel_027~1_npc=I expected to find you resting.
~01~~panel_028~1_legend=[light]Resting? Now, when I feel the fire in my blood again? \nWhen all that was stolen returns to me? Pah!
~01~~panel_029~1_legend=[light]Those creatures no longer taint the airs of my mountain with their rank mushroom breath!
~01~~panel_030~1_legend=[light]For the first time in [i]centuries,[] \nI begin to feel like myself!
~01~~panel_031~2_npc=I am pleased to hear it.
~01~~panel_032~3_legend=[light]And yet you're making that damp face.
~01~~panel_033~3_legend=[light]No.
~01~~panel_033~4_npc=Am I?
~01~~panel_034~2_npc=[small]I suppose the tunnels [i]are[] a bit... [i]moist...[]
~01~~panel_034~3_legend=[light]We have little of value to spend, besides time. \nWe shall need to remedy that... hmm.
~01~~panel_035~1_npc=Ah! A stroke of fortune, or maybe fate...
~01~~panel_036~1_legend=[light]Those pennyblades. How \nexactly are we paying them?
~01~~panel_037~1_npc=They saw, I think, that our purposes aligned.
~01~~panel_038~2_npc=I might have offered some reward, but <bookish.exists:they appeared/that <hothead.mf:man/woman/<hothead.whm:fighter/tracker/mystic>>, the lone survivor, seemed> content the job was done.
~01~~panel_038~3_legend=[light]Our [i]purposes[]. Hm.
~01~~panel_039~1_legend=[light]And who did they think [i]you[] were?
~01~~panel_039~2_npc=The simple servant of a wronged <legend.mf:lord/lady/lord>?
~01~~panel_040~1_legend=[light]So you did [i]mention[] me.
~01~~panel_040~2_npc=I... have I done wrong?
~01~~panel_041~1_legend=[light][i]Wrong?[] No.
~01~~panel_042~1_legend=[light]No, no... what does it matter, really?
~01~~panel_042~2_npc=I thought they should know this was your home, lest... they might try to claim it.
~01~~panel_043~1_legend=[light]Hm. I might've enjoyed that. But fine. Seal whatever entrance you brought them through.
~01~~panel_044~1_npc=Yes, my <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>.
~01~~panel_046~1_legend=[light]<npc>, loyal <npc>... If you had seen me that night...
~01~~panel_047~1_legend=[gray]The very night I shattered my prison, after millenia enshackled. My mind gone strange.
~01~~panel_047~2_legend=[gray]I could finally match gazes with the stars again.\nAnd planets. Their equal, once more.
~01~~panel_048~1_legend=[light]I might've gone anywhere, then. But I longed for my mountain. My perches, my caves. My basking stone. I even remembered you, Brakken.
~01~~panel_049~1_legend=[light]Mm.
~01~~panel_049~3_npc=My first waking thought was to find you, <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> <legend>.\nI knew nothing of all the years gone by...
~01~~panel_050~1_legend=[light]Yes, the years. I'd had no one to listen to me squamble and curse. No one to puzzle over my equivocal utterances, or quail as I hissed and sang. But I [i]also[]... I lost track of... time.
~01~~panel_050~2_npc=I regret... or I wish...
~01~~panel_051~1_npc=The day you were imprisoned... that very day, I swore I would free you myself, whatever the price. I only need survive long enough... to bring you back.
~01~~panel_052~1_legend=[light]Let it go, I don't fault you. When my power was sealed, naturally... your own vitality would diminish.
~01~~panel_053~1_npc=But between one hiding-place and the next... I slept. I only slept! \nAnd never woke up again. Through all the ages since...
~01~~panel_054~1_legend=[light]If anything, be glad. You were preserved until the \nmoment I needed you. You're like a little pickled pigfoot!
~01~~panel_054~4_npc=Oh... [small]must I be a [i]pigfoot,[] my <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>?
~01~~panel_055~1_legend=[light]And look! Feel it! Stand in that golden heat...!
~01~~panel_056~1_legend=[light]Things will be as they were, Brakken! As if this mountain was never taken from us! \nAnd hill by hill, river by river, we shall reclaim the sum of all we once called--!!
~01~~panel_058~1_action=[gold][actionSmall]*sniff*
~01~~panel_059~1_legend=[light]That smell...
~01~~panel_059~2_npc=Yes. Our guests have prepared you a fine feast.
~01~~panel_060~1_legend=[light]Ah. How... [small]considerate...
