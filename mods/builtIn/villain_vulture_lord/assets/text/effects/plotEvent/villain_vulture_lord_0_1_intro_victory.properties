You alright?/[face:interested]Can put the shovel down now. Those things are... hey, you alright?/We done here? Wasn't too... uh, you alright?/Just a small band of them, luckily. Probably scouts or... hey, you alright?>
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_npc=Hrm... yes... just... uhhh...
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_action=[navy]*swoon*
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_healer=<healer.bookish/coward/healer/60:[face:skeptical]Hmm. <npc.mf:He's/She's/They're> not in any shape to walk. Should we make use of the wagon?/[face:grim]<npc.mf:He doesn't/She doesn't/They don't> look so good. Can't leave <npc.mf:him/her/them> here, but... what do we do?/Poor <npc.mf:man/woman/thing>. Think we can carry <npc.mf:him/her/them> back to the inn?/Well, we can't leave <npc.mf:him/her/them> here. Should we...?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_bookish=<bookish.coward/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:Huh? Oh, sorry. Surprised me./What were [i]you[] doing?/[face:grim]Caught me off guard./I don't know <npc.mf:him/her/them>./Figured [i]you[] would./Caught me off guard.>
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_hothead=<hothead.goofball/snark/60:[face:skeptical]Oof. Didn't even try to catch <npc.mf:him/her/them>./[face:dubious]Oof. Didn't even [i]try[] to catch <npc.mf:him/her/them>./Thought you'd try to catch <npc.mf:him/her/them>.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc=Grrp... where... what...?
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hothead=Easy, now. There's a place up ahead. You're safe while you're with us. Get some rest.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_narration=By the time they reach the roadhouse, the stranger is fully awake. <npc.mf:He/She/They> calmly <npc.mf:declines/declines/decline> all offers to treat <npc.mf:his/her/their> wounds, accepting only a seat at the table and a bowl of warm broth.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_narration=<npc.mf:He lets/She lets/They let> the steam bathe <npc.mf:his/her/their> face for a few moments, breathing deeply, then takes the bowl to <npc.mf:his/her/their> lips and drains it.
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_npc=Mmm. Do they not say that medicine mends the body, while a warm meal restores the mien?
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_healer=You look... brighter.
~01~prompt~panel_010~4_bookish=[small]Restores the [i]what?[] The [i]men?[]
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_npc=I... yes. Yes, I have called the Grayreaches home since I was... [i]very[] young.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_hothead=<hothead.bookish/hothead/poet/60:[face:skeptical]Can't say I've ever heard that one./Huh. Never heard that one./[face:skeptical]Can't say I've ever heard that one./I... hadn't heard that one.>\nYou live around here?
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_npc2=Oh! Nan [i]said[] that was the name, a long time ago. This stretch of country. "From high atop the grayest peak, all the land in shadow's reach...!"
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_npc=Is that not what you call these lands?
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_bookish=Grayreaches?
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_npc2=Or something like that. Had a \nfunny way of naming, back then.
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_npc=Yes, well. Some of us still use the name.
~01~prompt~panel_017~3_npc=Shall we go stand by the fire?
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_npc=It occurs to me, friends, that I owe you an introduction. <npc> is my name. I am a servant.
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_bookish=A... I wouldn't have taken you for...
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_npc=A life of servitude is little valued by some. Derided by others.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_npc=Yet it is the life of my choosing. Other paths presented themselves. Easier paths, perhaps, but deplorable to my eyes. Through every hardship I have stood by my <npc.mf:lord/lady/lord>...
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_npc=...whilst <npc.mf:he/she/they> endured all the ills and indignities the world would inflict.
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_npc=But now... to have <npc.mf:his/her/their> home overrun by those... those [i]things[]. Worshippers of false gods. What do they call themselves? Downers?
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/coward/goofball/romantic/60:[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:happy]/[face:interested]/>
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_hothead=<hothead.bookish/coward/healer/snark/60:Perhaps you mean Deepists?/Deepists, maybe?/Deepists, maybe?/Think you mean Deepists./You talking about Deepists?>
~01~prompt~panel_024~2_npc=Ah, yes. That's the word.
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_npc=In the roots of our mountain, their tunnels sprout and tangle like weeds. \nIn our home... beneath my <npc.mf:lord's/lady's/lord's> chair... their leader skulks...
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_npc=And from safety, he directs his followers to conquer and pillage. Their numbers grow. They spread. Their stronghold all but unassailable. Except...
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_npc=...there are a few passages... entrances which only my <npc.mf:lord/lady/lord> and I know of. So I came, in search of a few brave souls to aid us.
~01~prompt~panel_028~2_npc=Dare I hope... that my search is over?
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_narration=Later...
~01~prompt~panel_029~2_healer=<healer.bookish/goofball/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:grim]<npc>'s asleep. Wearied by the day's events, though <npc.mf:he/she/they> wouldn't admit it./<npc>'s gone to bed. Tuckered out quick after all the excitement./<npc> finally nodded off. Long day for <npc.mf:him/her/them>./[face:interested]<npc>'s resting, finally. Long day for <npc.mf:him/her/them>./<npc>'s gone to bed. Tuckered out quick after all the excitement./<npc>'s off to bed. Should sleep well tonight, after everything.>
~01~prompt~panel_030~1_hothead=You've been quiet, <bookish.rfln.hothead:<bookish>/<bookish>/love/<bookish>>.<bookish.loner/60: I mean, even by [i]your[] standards./> Something on your mind?
~01~prompt~panel_030~2_bookish=<bookish.bookish/loner/60:Only pondering our good fortune. That we should meet this <npc.mf:man/woman/person>, and <npc.mf:he/she/they> should meet us./[face:interested]Hmm? Sorry. Just thinking it was lucky. How we found <npc.mf:him/her/them>./Hmm? Nothing, really. Just thinking it was lucky we found <npc.mf:him/her/them>. And <npc.mf:he/she/they> found us.>
~01~prompt~panel_031~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/coward/hothead/60:Our way forward... how we proceed... there's little left to consider./[face:interested]Wasn't sure what we were getting into at first. Now... seems fairly straightforward, right? Nothing to argue over./Makes our next move real clear. Nothing left to hem and haw over./What we do next... isn't \nreally in question, is it?>
~01~prompt~panel_032~1_npc2=Well, there is [i]one[] thing.
~01~prompt~panel_033~2_npc2=Can't be a real band of adventurers unless \nyou have a name. Something [i]catchy.[] Like...

~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_npc2=<nameSuggestion.3>?
~05~choice_four~panel_001~1_leader=[light]Choose your \n own name...
~06~~panel_001~1_npc2=It's perfect!
