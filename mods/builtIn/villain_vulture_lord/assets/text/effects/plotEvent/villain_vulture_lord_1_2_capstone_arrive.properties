.blurb=Fight some guys...
.longName=Graymountain
.name=Event
~01~~panel_001~1_narration=They pick their way through canyons and up cliffsides,\nfollowing the path that <npc> marked.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=The great mountain that once loomed in the distance\ngrows wider and taller with every step.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Austere and silent, it watches their advance.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=Its sides are pewter gray and strangely smooth. Its peak disappears into the clouds.
~01~~panel_003~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/greedy/healer/leader/loner/poet/romantic/60:The rock formations are curious... doesn't look like it would be easy material to work with. I wonder how <npc> and <npc.mf:his lord/her lady/their lord> came to live here?/All this gray rock... doesn't look good for much. Wonder how <npc> and <npc.mf:his/her/their> boss came to live here... and why they'd want it back./Kind of a gloomy place to call home. But I guess it's all a matter of what you're used to./Not the most hospitable place to call home. <npc> said <npc.mf:his lord/her lady/his lord> was born here. But it makes me wonder.../Not the easiest place to find. Maybe that's part of the charm./I wonder if it's changed at all, since the first people came here? How small we must look from those lofty heights./It's pretty, in a way. Though not the type of place I'd pick to settle down./Didn't <npc> say <npc.mf:his/her/their> boss lived up here? Weird place to call home...>
~01~~panel_004~1_action=click\n  clack
~01~~panel_005~1_hothead=Shhh. You hear...?
~01~~panel_006~1_npc=Ah. My friends. You've come.
~01~~panel_006~2_hothead=<hothead.coward/hothead/loner/60:Sorry if we kept you waiting./Kept you waiting?/Sorry if we kept you waiting./Hope we didn't keep you waiting.>
~01~~panel_007~1_npc=No, no. I have been busy myself. Preparing, watching. I have caught news of your deeds. \nAs have the Deepists. That prophet of theirs... he is unsettled.
~01~~panel_008~1_npc=In the mountain, he gathers \nthe greatest of his warriors.
~01~~panel_009~1_npc=But I can get you past the outer walls, allow you to strike where they least expect it. \nAt their prophet's sun-hating little heart...
~01~~panel_010~1_npc=Still, it will not be easy. He keeps a formidable force around him always.
~01~~panel_011~1_healer=<healer.coward/loner/snark/60:Won't say it's a fight I'm looking forward to. Thing is, though, if it'll save us a lot more fighting down the line.../My mind's made up. Wouldn't have come all this way if I didn't mean to see it through./[face:skeptical]If we didn't think we could do it, we \nwouldn't have come all this way./We know the risk. Think our minds are pretty made up. Best thing now is to be quick, and be done with it.[face:talking]>
~01~~panel_012~2_npc=I... I thank you.
~01~~panel_012~3_hothead=<hothead.coward/goofball/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Hopefully this'll just be an unpleasant memory. By tomorrow, I mean./[face:happy]You'll be polishing the furniture, this time tomorrow./[face:talking]Anyway we're not [i]un[]formidable ourselves./[face:neutral]Can't promise much. But you'll have your home back./[face:talking]You'll have your home back. If we die, you can call us liars./You'll have your home back soon, <npc>.>
~01~~panel_013~1_npc=Now come. Speed is good. \nNot falling is better.
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=<npc> leads them on and upward, finding paths and ledges\non the mountain's side that were invisible from below.
~01~~panel_014~3_narration=<npc.mf:He is/She is/They are> surefooted, unwavering, as if every fissure\nand every bend is etched in <npc.mf:his/her/their> memory.
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=At last <npc.mf:he stops/she stops/they stop>. Pulls aside a pile of brush, revealing a person-sized crevice.
~01~~panel_016~1_narration=Inside is a dark, cavernous space. Whether it was formed \nby nature or human hands is difficult to discern.
~01~~panel_016~2_narration=But it feels old.
~01~~panel_016~3_narration=Older than the broken castles that speckle the valleys below.
~01~~panel_017~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:Remarkable. Is this your home, <npc>?/Is [i]this[] where you lived, <npc>? It doesn't look.../Remarkable. Is this where you once lived?/Wish we had more light. Is this your home, <npc>?/Huh. So this is your home, <npc>?/So, <npc>... is this your home?>
~01~~panel_018~1_npc=This is a passageway.
~01~~panel_019~1_npc=Further along, though... well.\nIt was more splendid then.
~01~~panel_020~1_npc=When I first set foot on these stones...
~01~~panel_021~1_npc=That day, I was cold. So cold. Wondering \nif the sun would ever rise again.
~01~~panel_022~1_npc=But the mountain sheltered me. It gave me life.
~01~~panel_023~1_healer=How long ago was that?
~01~~panel_024~1_npc=You lose count of the years.
~01~~panel_025~2_hothead=And your boss? <npc.mf:Was he/Was she/Were they>--
~01~~panel_025~3_npc=Ah, we have come to the stairwell.
~01~~panel_026~3_npc=Through the trap door at the bottom is a small tunnel, leading to the underhall. I have been using it to gather information unseen.
~01~~panel_027~1_healer=<healer.coward/goofball/greedy/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]We're ready, then? For...?/Time to mess with \nthem, I guess.[face:happy]/Then we're ready? \nWe're going in?[face:skeptical]/[face:neutral]Get ready, I guess./[face:skeptical]Time to mess with \nthem, I guess./Then we're good to go?>
~01~~panel_028~1_npc=There is one more thing.
~01~~panel_029~3_npc=Once the alarm is sounded, the cultists will come swiftly to protect their prophet.
~01~~panel_030~3_npc=On the western side of the hall, one of the pillars has never stood right. The stone is weak enough, one of you might bring it down with a solid blow. That should stop their forces pouring in.
~01~~panel_031~1_hothead=How long have you been planning this?
