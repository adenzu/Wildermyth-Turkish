No one told me it would be all slimy./[face:interested]Phew. How did [i]I[] get stuck with this job?/Not a moment too soon.../[face:happy]Alright. Time to take a good whack./Now. Time to stop their advance./Ugh. They're coming in swarms. Well, here goes./They say one loose stone dooms a fortress./[face:skeptical]<hothead>, the mighty stoneslayer.../[face:skeptical]Hope this isn't anybody's favorite rock.>

~01~~panel_004~1_narration=The archway collapses and the wall with it, floor giving \nway beneath <hothead.mf:him/her/them> as stones splinter and fall.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=It's a short but painful drop.
~01~~panel_006~2_hothead=<hothead.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/80:I suppose I should've anticipated that.../[face:interested]Did I just bury myself? No... no, there's a way out, I'm sure. Aren't I sure? I'm [i]sure...[]/[face:interested]Neat. I didn't die./That was a little more dangerous \nthan I was prepared for.../[face:interested]I guess when you tug on a mountain's teeth, it'll tend to bite down, won't it?/[face:interested]Whew.

~01~~panel_013~2_narration=It's harsh, blinding as day...
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=...until the next moment, when it dims...
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=...vanishing with a thud.
~01~~panel_017~2_npc=<hothead>?
~01~~panel_018~2_npc=My torch, maybe?
~01~~panel_018~3_hothead=<npc>? What're you...? There was a light...
