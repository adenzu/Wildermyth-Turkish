~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The old mine has gone silent. In the next chamber, <hothead.exists:they find/<bookish> finds> a workshop, full of cogs and bones and half-finished projects.

~01~~panel_004.(hothead_exists)~2_narration=No article they find amongst the clutter speaks any answer<deadHero.exists: or solace/>. A mutual longing grows to feel the breeze on their faces, to leave this eery space and all its mysteries behind them.
