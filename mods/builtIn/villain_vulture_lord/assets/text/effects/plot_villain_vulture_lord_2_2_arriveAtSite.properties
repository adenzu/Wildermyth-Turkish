~01~~panel_002~1_bookish=Roads, trails... foxpaths. Wonder how many foxfeet it takes to...
~01~~panel_004~1_healer=Wasn't going to say anything.
~01~~panel_004~2_bookish=<bookish.bookish/healer/leader/60:Ah, <healer>. I've been falling behind again, haven't I?/<healer>? Sorry, I didn't mean to fall behind./I know. I'm falling behind again./Oh, <healer>. I'm... falling behind again, huh?>
~01~~panel_005~1_bookish=Been thinking, actually, about a book I read once. Memoirs of a <npc3.mf:man/woman/person> named <npc3.fullName>.
~01~~panel_006~2_bookish=<bookish.bookish/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/poet/60:In <npc3.mf:his/her/their> youth <npc3.mf:he was/she was/they were> employed by tradesmen, to sell their goods from town to town. And wherever <npc3.mf:he/she/they> stopped, <npc3.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> seek out the local storyteller, to hear the legends that'd been passed down through generations./[face:interested]<npc3.mf:He was/She was/They were> something of a trail trotter when <npc3.mf:he was/she was/they were> young. With a passion for old things. Old shoes, old cheese, and especially old stories. Each town <npc3.mf:he/she/they> came to, <npc3.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> go clamoring after the local storytellers. Wouldn't let them alone till <npc3.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> heard everything they had to tell./Didn't have a lot growing up, so <npc3.mf:he/she/they> took to a traveling life, buying goods in one place, selling them in another. And wherever <npc3.mf:he/she/they> went, <npc3.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> listen to the stories people told, the ones passed down through generations./Spent some years as a traveling merchant, early on. Got to know people of different lands, and the stories they told. Stories passed down through time, father to daughter, mother to son./<npc3.mf:He/She/They> did a lot of traveling, when <npc3.mf:he was/she was/they were> young. Something of a rambler. Liked to listen to the local stories, wherever <npc3.mf:he/she/they> stopped. Legends and things, that'd been passed down through the years./<npc3.mf:He/She/They> had a wanderer's heart. Feet that liked to rove. And ears that craved a good story. Wherever <npc3.mf:he/she/they> went, <npc3.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> ask to hear the oldest and most interesting legends./Started out as a traveling merchant. But <npc3.mf:he/she/they> had an interest in stories. Wherever <npc3.mf:he/she/they> stopped, <npc3.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> seek out the local storyteller, hear the legends and fables that made up the fabric of each region.>
~01~~panel_007~2_bookish=Ended up putting a lot of them in print. A dozen or so tomes altogether. <bookish.bookish/60: Unfortunately, I was never able to track them all down./Lot to read, if you like that sort of thing.>
~01~~panel_008~1_bookish=But, well, it wasn't just the stories themselves that interested <npc3.mf:him/her/them>. It was where they came from. How they began.
~01~~panel_009~2_bookish=<bookish.bookish/goofball/hothead/poet/60:You see, <npc3.mf:he/she/they> discovered many fragments of the same stories scattered across distant lands. Form and flavor might vary according to the teller. Even the roles of villains and heroes might be reversed. But the common threads were stronger than the tangential variances./See, from one land to the next, the same stories kept cropping up. Shaped a little different by time and teller, but still made of the same stuff. Like how a blob-shaped onion cake is still an onion cake deep down./See, there were some that kept popping up no matter how far <npc3.mf:he/she/they> traveled. Told different, but still recognizable under all the strange additions and elaborations of their tellers./Often <npc3.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> find a common thread, between the legends of one land and another. The details might vary, as two artists might paint a landscape from different perspectives. But the object of their art, their inspiration, remains the same./See, for all <npc3.mf:his/her/their> wandering, <npc3.mf:he/she/they> kept stumbling upon the same stories. Made to look different by the twists and wrinkles of each teller, but full of the same heroes and villains, themes and consequences.>
~01~~panel_010~2_bookish=<npc3.mf:He/She/They> thought that in each story there was probably some kernel of truth, some real piece of our past dressed up in the guise of a fable.
~01~~panel_011~1_healer=Hmm. Hard to get at that truth, though. \nIf everyone tells it differently.
~01~~panel_012~3_hero=Sort of like... the road apple fiasco.
~01~~panel_013~1_healer=<hothead.exists:/[face:skeptical]Ugh. Don't get me started. <bookish.mf:He mangles/She mangles/They mangle> it every time.>
~01~~panel_013~3_hero=I mean, when I hear the way <bookish> tells it, and then I hear <hothead.exists:<hothead>'s/<healer>'s> version...
~01~~panel_013~4_hothead=<hothead.exists:Ugh. Don't get me started. <bookish.mf:He mangles/She mangles/They mangle> it every time./>
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=It's a few more hours before they reach <town>. By then, smoke chokes the air and all cause for laughter is forgotten.
~01~~panel_016~1_narration=They find the town in shambles. Fires raging, the corpses of Drauven and Morthagi mingled with townsfolk.
~01~~panel_016~2_narration=But the fighting's not done...
