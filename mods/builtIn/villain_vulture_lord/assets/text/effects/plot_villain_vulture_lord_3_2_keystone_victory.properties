~01~~panel_008.(company_is_vulture_defeatedDrauven)~1_narration=Already folk have begun to tear down Vulta's banners, throwing them on the same fires that consume the remnants of Morthagi.
~01~~panel_009.(company_NOT_vulture_defeatedDrauven).(volunteer_is_npcRetreat)~1_narration=A sudden, shrill cry goes up. Whether made by bird's beak or lizard's lips, the Drauven understand it.

~01~~panel_018~1_farmer=<volunteer>! You had me worried, kiddo. \nWhen I found you were gone...
~01~~panel_019~2_narration=Quickly, farmer <farmer> tells <hero.exists:them/<hothead>> all <farmer.mf:he's/she's/they've> learned from Vulta's soldiers.
~01~~panel_020~1_farmer=They were boasting one night that Vulta was immortal, that those who served <legend.mf:him/her/them> true would receive godly gifts...
~01~~panel_021~1_farmer=Talked about the war with the <company.vulture_defeatedDrauven:Drauven/Morthagi> like it had been some kind of game. A contest. To prove their worth.
