~01~~panel_001~1_npc3=Oh fishy fish, I see you there. With your fishy lips and\nyour fishy stare... Oh fishy fish, with scales so blue...
~01~~panel_002~1_bookish=<bookish.coward/healer/loner/60:Um... hello?/Good morning.../Um... hello?/Hello there...>
~01~~panel_003~1_npc3=Glack! Who's that?
~01~~panel_004~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/coward/goofball/60:<hero.exists:We were/I was> told <npc3.fullName> made <npc3.mf:his/her/their> home in these parts. An author of myths and histories. Would that be you?/Sorry, <hero.exists:we're/I'm>, uh, looking for... you wouldn't be <npc3.fullName>, would you?/[face:happy]Snappy tune caught <hero.exists:our/my> ears. Came looking for someone named <npc3.fullName>. That you?/[face:default]<hero.exists:We're/I'm> looking for a <npc3.fullName>. You <npc3.mf:him/her/them>?>
~01~~panel_004~2_npc3=If I wasn't, would I be wearing <npc3.mf:his/her/their> scarf? Or fishing in <npc3.mf:his/her/their> pond?
~01~~panel_005~1_npc3=So, what are you selling? Teethbrushes? Adventure clothes?\nCan't pay you in anything but fish.
~01~~panel_006~1_bookish=<bookish.vulture_readBook:<bookish.bookish/poet/60:[face:happy]Actually, I'm something of a reader. I stumbled upon your work some time ago. Your style was delightful, your passion for the subject as palpable as--ah, but excuse me. I'm getting carried away./[face:happy]Actually, I'm something of an admirer. I stumbled upon your work in younger years. Delightfully crisp, your turn of phrase, woven with such--/Actually, I'm sort of... an admirer of your work. Never imagined I'd be standing here, face to face with you like this.>/<bookish.bookish/goofball/healer/leader/60:[face:happy]<hero.exists:We've/I've> come to exchange words, not wares. <npc2>, of Idyllbrick, had an inkling you might help <hero.exists:us/me>./[face:happy]Oh, nah, you got the wrong idea. There's this <npc2.mf:guy/lady/person> named <npc2>, see, and <npc2.mf:he/she/they> told us--/<hero.exists:We were/I was> only hoping to have a word with you, if you don't mind. A young <npc2.mf:man/woman/person> at a roadhouse, <npc2>, thought you might--/Actually, it's information <hero.exists:we're/I'm> after. <npc2>, at the Idyllbrick Inn, thought you might be able to help./Actually, <hero.exists:we/I> just wanted to talk to you. <npc2> sent <hero.exists:us/me>. <npc2.mf:Man/Woman/Person> who runs Idyllbrick Inn.>>
~01~~panel_006~2_npc3=<bookish.vulture_readBook:Oho, a reader, are you? [i]And[] a flatterer. I like you already./<npc2>? From the inn? Always was an impressionable child. What is it this time?>
~01~~panel_007~1_bookish=<bookish.vulture_readBook:Thing is, my friends and I... there's a mystery we've been trying to solve. About this brooch. Wondering if you might take a look at it./<npc2.mf:He/She/They> recognized this brooch, and... could you take a look?>
~01~~panel_008~1_npc3=Let's see... hmm, yes, that's...
~01~~panel_009~1_npc3=Put a picture of this in my book, didn't I? Funny thing about it, though...
~01~~panel_010~1_bookish=What's that?
~01~~panel_011~1_npc3=Eh. Better come back to my cabin. That's where I keep all my notes.
~01~~panel_012~1_npc3=<bookish.vulture_readBook:Guess I don't have to tell [i]you[] how I went about collecting my stories./See, I'm not so much a writer of stories, as I am a collecter.>
~01~~panel_013~1_npc3=Traveled for years, picking up bits here and pieces there. Wrote down everything I heard, then spent more years stitching them all together.
~01~~panel_014~1_npc3=The Vulture <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>... I remember finding half-remembered fragments of [i]that[] tale in all kinds of places, sometimes so distorted by time they were barely recognizable.
~01~~panel_015~1_npc3=It's those types of stories interest me most. Keep me coming back. To pick at them, like an old scab, wondering what's underneath.
~01~~panel_016~1_npc3=Let's see, now. One of these, probably.
~01~~panel_017~1_npc3=Story I... hup... put in my book... oof... was really just the simplest... erp... account.
~01~~panel_018~1_npc3=Vulture... <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord> of the beasts... a tyrant who demanded all things pay <legend.mf:him/her/them> tribute in flesh.
~01~~panel_019~1_npc3=Until our ancestors rose up against <legend.mf:him/her/them>, sealing away <legend.mf:his/her/their> immortal soul in a magical jewel thing.
~01~~panel_020~1_npc3=Those were the common points, how most people told it. But, you know, there's always [i]one[]...
~01~~panel_021~1_npc3=See, I was bold and reckless in my youth, if you'll believe it. Liked to go wandering deep into wild woods.
~01~~panel_022~1_narration=In the last days of a balmy autumn, I chanced upon a lonesome cottage.
~01~~panel_023~1_narration=Some called <legend.mf:him/her/them> a crackpot, some a weaver of spells.\nHad a reputation for removing curses.
~01~~panel_023~2_narration=Home of an old hermit <legend.mf:man/woman/person>.
~01~~panel_024~1_narration=But when <legend.mf:he/she/they> heard of my hobby, <legend.mf:he/she/they> welcomed me in, and spun me a tale of the Vulture <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>.
~01~~panel_024~2_narration=<legend.mf:His/Her/Their> eyes shone. <legend.mf:His/Her/Their> chin quivered.
~01~~panel_024~3_narration=<legend.mf:He was/She was/They were> adamant in the details.
~01~~panel_024~4_narration=Though they little resembled the other accounts I'd heard.
~01~~panel_025~1_npc3=Must have made it up <legend.mf:himself/herself/themself>. Couldn't very well include it in my book.
~01~~panel_026~1_npc3=Good story, though. Have a read.
~01~~panel_027~1_narration=The pages are frail and timeworn. The writing looks like dogscratch.\n<bookish> squints, and begins to pluck words like berries from a bramble.
~01~~panel_028~1_bookish=When our land was cold. And bitter. All life at the mercy of the sun's... whims. It was Vulture, <legend.mf:he/she/they> alone, who dared defy...
~01~~panel_029~1_bookish=In <legend.mf:his/her/their> beak <legend.mf:he/she/they> captured it, the light of the sun itself... though it... burned <legend.mf:his/her/their> feathers and scorched <legend.mf:his/her/their> skin. But down <legend.mf:he/she/they>... dove... down and down. And when at last <legend.mf:he/she/they> alighted...
~01~~panel_032~1_bookish=<legend.mf:He/She/They> was changed. Mighty beyond measure. Immortal as the fire <legend.mf:he/she/they> now commanded.
~01~~panel_033~1_narration=Now with <legend.mf:his/her/their> gift, <legend.mf:he/she/they> melted the frozen land. Rivers ran. And green things grew.
~01~~panel_033~2_narration=And all the beasts who then dwelled in the Grayreaches...
~01~~panel_033~3_narration=...the flighty fox and the restless wren... the gangly goat and the torpid toad...
~01~~panel_034~1_narration=...they named <legend.mf:him/her/them> their <legend.mf:lord/queen/lord>. <legend.mf:He/She/They>, whose courage and cunning had brought them life.
~01~~panel_034~2_narration=And when their lives were spent, to <legend.mf:him/her/them> they pledged their flesh.
~01~~panel_034~3_narration=A just tribute. The only one <legend.mf:he/she/they> required.
~01~~panel_035~1_bookish=So it was. And would have always been. Had not there come to the valley another family of beasts. They who called themselves human.
~01~~panel_036~1_narration=Furless, featherless, afraid of the night. Pitiful creatures, <legend.mf:he/she/they> thought them.
~01~~panel_036~2_narration=<legend.mf:He/She/They> allowed them to raise their homes in the shadow of <legend.mf:his/her/their> mountain. And often <legend.mf:he/she/they> would come down amongst them, to offer them <legend.mf:his/her/their> wisdom.
~01~~panel_037~1_narration=They would bow and grovel and sing <legend.mf:his/her/their> praises.
~01~~panel_037~2_narration=But always, they complained of the cold.
~01~~panel_038~3_narration=And so one day <legend.mf:he/she/they> brought to them a single flame from <legend.mf:his/her/their> mountain.
~01~~panel_039~1_bookish=In their hearts they were jealous of Vulture. Jealous, and full of guile. They took <legend.mf:his/her/their> gift, and with it grew strong, spreading like vermin over the valley. But when <legend.mf:he/she/they> returned to claim <legend.mf:his/her/their> tribute, they refused to yield what was <legend.mf:his/her/their> due. And wielding the Vulture <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>'s flame against <legend.mf:him/her/them>...
~01~~panel_040~1_npc3=Hmm? Give it here.
~01~~panel_041~2_bookish=I... can't make out the next words. Sorry, it's--
~01~~panel_042~3_npc3=Uh... hoom... the flames... climbed and... what is that, pinesap? But the loyal... protected... so <npc.mf:his/her/their> soul was bound...
~01~~panel_043~3_npc3=Ah, here, this page's better. Something about unspeakable agony, and then... <legend.mf:He/She/They> would not die, while the sun's fire was clutched in that gray mountain.
~01~~panel_044~3_npc3=<legend.mf:He/She/They> swore to capture every town and hamlet. To make the humans bow to <legend.mf:him/her/them> and call <legend.mf:him lord/her queen/them lord>.
~01~~panel_045~1_narration=And so <legend.mf:he/she/they> did.
~01~~panel_046~2_hero=<hero.exists:That's it? That's the end?/>
~01~~panel_046~3_npc3=Hehe... Said the same thing myself.
~01~~panel_046~4_bookish=<hero.exists:/That's it? That's the end?>
~01~~panel_047~1_npc3=After some badgering, I got the hermit <legend.mf:man/woman/person> to add this footnote: Later, a duplicitous dullard trapped the Vulture <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>'s soul in a dwemerald. The end.
~01~~panel_047~2_healer=<healer.exists:<healer.bookish/poet/60:Certainly... an unusual ending./Certainly... an unusual ending./Huh. That's... a twist.>>
~01~~panel_048~2_npc3=Anyhow, like I said, couldn't put the [i]story[] in my book. But there was something else I took away with me that day.
~01~~panel_049~1_npc3=<legend.mf:He/She/They> showed me a ring, with this symbol on it. Said it was the crest of the Vulture <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>.
~01~~panel_050~1_npc3=I'd never seen it's like anywhere else before. Thought I might as well use it.
~01~~panel_051~1_narration=<hero.exists:They stay/<bookish> stays> a few more hours, sifting through <npc3>'s collection.
~01~~panel_052.(hero_exists)~2_hero=You think it's possible? That's who we're at war with? A Vulture <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>?
~01~~panel_052.(hero_exists)~3_bookish=<bookish.bookish/goofball/healer/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested]/[face:joy]/[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:happy]/[face:skeptical]/>
~01~~panel_053.(hero_exists)~1_hothead=<hothead.exists:Too many similarities to be coincidence. I mean... [i]Vulta?[]/>
~01~~panel_053.(hero_exists)~2_bookish=<hothead.exists:/Too many similarities to be coincidence. Even the name.>
~01~~panel_053.(hero_exists)~3_hero=Yeah.
~01~~panel_054.(hero_exists)~3_hothead=<hothead.exists:<hothead.vulture_escapedTown:<company.vulture_freedTown:Hm. Well. Long journey back./We need to get to <volunteer>. And <farmer>. Before we wander any more.>/<company.vulture_freedTown:Hm. Well. Long journey back./Hm. Well. We've done enough wandering. \nThere's a battle waiting.>>/>
~01~~panel_054.(hero_exists)~4_hero=<hothead.exists:/<hero.vulture_escapedTown:<company.vulture_freedTown:Hm. Well. Long journey back./We need to get to <volunteer>. And <farmer>. Before we wander any more.>/<company.vulture_freedTown:Hm. Well. Long journey back./Hm. Well. We've done enough wandering. \nThere's a battle waiting.>>>
~01~~panel_055.(hero_is_missing)~1_npc3=Stop by any time you like! Got stories coming out my ears!
~01~~panel_056.(hero_is_missing)~1_narration=The long walk back will give <bookish.mf:him/her/them> plenty of time to mull things over.
~01~~panel_056.(hero_is_missing)~2_bookish=Vulta... Vulture <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord>... can't be coincidence.
