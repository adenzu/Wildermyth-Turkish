~01~~panel_001~1_darken=Flames are quenched. Smoke drifts away.
~01~~panel_001~2_darken=Few homes survived ruin. With time, they'll be repaired. But there'll be no replacing the lives that were lost.
~01~~panel_002~1_darken=As night swoops in, the survivors make hasty efforts to collect their dead, arranging the corpses in the undertaker's shed.
~01~~panel_002~2_darken=They leave the Drauven and Morthagi for tomorrow.
~01~~panel_003~1_darken=Those without shelter find their way to Farmer <farmer>'s barn.
~01~~panel_004~1_farmer=Come along, now, plenty room for everybody.
~01~~panel_005~2_volunteer=Hang on, <farmer.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>. We don't know this <hero.mf:guy/lady/person>.
~01~~panel_006~1_hero=<hero.coward/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:One of... I mean... if that's how you.../[face:skeptical]Sorry, uh, guess you didn't see how <hothead.exists:we/I> just handled those.../[face:angry]Attacked? Yeah look, if it wasn't for <hothead.exists:us/my friends>.../One of... I mean... if that's how you.../[face:skeptical]Yeah, sure. If that's the kind of thanks we get for.../Oh, <hothead.exists:we're/I'm> not... if you'll let me explain...>
~01~~panel_007~1_farmer=Doesn't mean we can't be mannerly.
~01~~panel_007~2_volunteer=For all we know, <hero.mf:he's/she's/they're> one of them who attacked us.
~01~~panel_008~1_farmer=It's alright. I saw what you did. I'm <farmer>, and that's my obnoxious kid, <volunteer>. We're happy to have you.
~01~~panel_009~1_volunteer=[i]Real[] happy.
~01~~panel_010~1_hothead=<hothead.exists:<hothead.hothead/loner/60:Could you tell us what happened here? How it started?/So... could you tell us how it started?/Know it won't be easy, but could you tell us what happened? How it started?>/>
~01~~panel_010~2_hero=<hothead.exists:/<hero.hothead/loner/60:Could you tell me what happened here? How it started?/So... could you tell me how it started?/Know it won't be easy, but could you tell me what happened here? How it started?>>
~01~~panel_011~1_farmer=If you don't mind waiting. More folk coming. Got to make sure they're made comfortable.
~01~~panel_012~1_farmer=<volunteer>, show <hothead.exists:them where they/<hero.mf:him where he/her where she/them where they>> can rest.
~01~~panel_013~1_volunteer=...Fine.
~01~~panel_016~1_volunteer=Some hay over here. Could put your head on a sack. Trough of water for drinking.
~01~~panel_017~1_bookish=<bookish.exists:<bookish.coward/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]I, uh... guess you still don't trust us, huh?/You [i]really[] don't want to trust us, huh?/You got a problem, <volunteer>? Still don't trust us?/[face:interested]I, uh... guess you still don't trust us, huh?/You got a problem, <volunteer>? Still don't trust us?/You still don't trust us, do you, <volunteer>?>/>
~01~~panel_017~2_hero=<bookish.exists:/<hero.coward/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]I, uh... guess you still don't trust <hothead.exists:us/me>, huh?/You [i]really[] don't want to trust <hothead.exists:us/me>, huh?/You got a problem, <volunteer>?

Still don't trust <hothead.exists:us/me>?/You still don't trust <hothead.exists:us/me>, do you, <volunteer>?>>
~01~~panel_018~1_volunteer=Outhouse is behind the barn, if you [i]must[].
~01~~panel_019~1_volunteer=That'd be like trusting a knife not to cut you. Or a flame not to burn.
~01~~panel_020~1_volunteer=Maybe you fought for us [i]today[], but who's to say you won't sell out tomorrow? Saw them with my own eyes. Types just like you, mingling with those lizardheads and bone contraptions.
~01~~panel_021~1_volunteer=Pillaging and murdering, while my <farmer.mf:dad/mom/parent> risked <farmer.mf:his/her/their> backside shepherding kids and oldfolk to safety.
~01~~panel_022~1_volunteer=What we need is more people like <farmer.mf:him/her/them>. Not you<hothead.exists: lot/>.
~01~~panel_023~1_action=*ahemm*
~01~~panel_024~1_volunteer=Oh, hey <farmer.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>. <hothead.exists:They were/<hero.mf:He was/She was/They were>> just, uh... getting settled.
~01~~panel_024~2_farmer=Sure.
~01~~panel_025~1_farmer=Now why don't you put that thing down and see what kind of supper you can rustle up from our stores?
~01~~panel_027~2_healer=<healer.exists:<healer.hothead/loner/snark/60:Seems touchy./Seems touchy./Seems touchy./Sorry. Didn't mean to cause trouble.>/>
~01~~panel_027~3_hero=<healer.exists:/Sorry. Didn't mean to cause trouble.>

~01~~panel_029~1_farmer=When the Morthagi appeared, <volunteer.mf:he/she/they> grabbed that pitchfork and tried to run out and join the fight. I held <volunteer.mf:him/her/them> back. Told <volunteer.mf:him/her/them> to guard the barn, mind the fires didn't get too close.
~01~~panel_030~1_healer=<healer.exists:So you could risk [i]your[] life instead?/>
~01~~panel_030~2_hero=<healer.exists:/So you could risk [i]your[] life instead?>
~01~~panel_031~2_farmer=I'm no hero. But if one of us had to...
~01~~panel_032~1_farmer=Anyway, though. That's how it began. Morthagi came crawling out of the fields and surrounded <town> before most had risen from their beds.
~01~~panel_033~1_farmer=Probably knew the Drauven were headed this way, and meant to get the drop on them. Saw the town for a convenient battleground.
~01~~panel_034~1_farmer=Don't think killing us was their reason for being here, but they sure didn't mind doing it. And the folks who were with them...
~01~~panel_035~1_hero=The mercenaries... you saw them, then?
~01~~panel_036~1_farmer=They'd be hard to miss, way they were hollering and... directing.
~01~~panel_037~2_farmer=Almost like it was the Morthagi taking orders from the people. I... can't be sure, but let's just say there wasn't much to [i]separate[] them. No hesitancy, no remorse.
~01~~panel_038~1_bookish=<bookish.exists:<bookish.bookish/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:skeptical]And here we were hoping we could settle things with words. Doesn't sound like such a sensible plan anymore./Guess our plan to talk to them is out./Doesn't sound like it'd do much good trying to talk to them, does it?/Anyone still think it's worth trying to talk things out?/Wish we'd gotten here sooner.

~01~~panel_038~2_hero=<bookish.exists:/Wish we'd gotten here sooner. We were hoping to talk to these mercenaries. Doesn't sound like such a reasonable goal anymore.>
~01~~panel_039~3_hothead=<hothead.exists:<hothead.bookish/coward/hothead/60:[face:grim]Their motivation is no secret. While this conflict drags on, there will be coin to be made.

~01~~panel_039~4_hero=<hothead.exists:/Now, the friends I've lost... I think I know what they'd want me to do. This war... can't be allowed to drag on.>
~01~~panel_040~1_volunteer=<hothead.exists:<hothead.bookish/coward/hothead/60:[face:interested]You mean... take the fight to [i]both[] sides?/[face:interested]By taking the fight to [i]both[] sides?/Take the fight to [i]both[] sides!/Take the fight to [i]both[] sides!>/[face:interested]You mean... take the fight to [i]both[] sides?>
~01~~panel_041~1_narration=When the new day dawns, <hothead.exists:they ready themselves/<hero> readies <hero.mf:himself/herself/themself>> for another road.
~01~~panel_042~1_farmer=Sort of feel I should try to talk you out of it. Not that I--
~01~~panel_042~2_hero=<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_043~1_volunteer=Hoo! <farmer.mf:Dad, did/Mom, did/Did> you hear?
~01~~panel_044~1_farmer=Hear what, kidlet?
~01~~panel_045~1_volunteer=Just talked to <folk1>. All those Drauven bodies they left out in the streets... been picked clean. Nothing left but bones.
~01~~panel_046~1_farmer=Oh? Coyotes, probably. Though I'll admit, all in one night...
~01~~panel_047~1_farmer=Hmm, well. You'd better be on your way. And if you ever find <hothead.exists:yourselves/yourself> round here again, know that my barn's always open to you.
~01~~panel_047~2_hero=<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_048~1_volunteer=Uh... good luck. I guess.
~01~~panel_049.(hothead_exists)~1_hothead=<healer.exists:<hothead.bookish/coward/healer/hothead/leader/60:It's possible. But what's our alternative?/[face:interested]Yeah, I... but... you have another idea?/[face:grim]Maybe. But I don't see we have another choice./Nah.

~01~~panel_049.(hothead_exists)~3_hero=<healer.exists:/Think it's a little foolhardy? Just the two of us, trying to end a war by ourselves?>

~01~~panel_053.(hothead_is_missing)~1_narration=It's a lonely walk to the edge of town, thoughts lingering on what's been lost. Ruin lies all around <hero.mf:him/her/them>.
