~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=Buried near <site> is a thing \nthe Mothman called a Glimrseen.
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_hunter=Here's another mark.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hunter=We're aiming for the real marshwoods now. \n<hunter.villainEcthis_wildernessHunterHero:<hunter.coward/goofball/greedy/healer/leader/snark/80:[face:interested]I'll admit, I've never gone this far.../Try not to eat the crawling fungus.[leader.face:skeptical]/[leader.face:interested]Rare fungi in there. Valuable, but hard to harvest./Don't open your mouth too wide in there.[leader.face:skeptical]/It'll be easy for something to ambush us in there./You'll like it a lot in there.[leader.face:dubious]/Even experienced trackers get lost there.>/I admit, I don't much love the smell.[face:skeptical]>
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_speech=[white]A Glimrseen is a physical place where this world remains stitched to another. It can be used for crossing over.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_speech=[white]But a Glimrseen is quite fragile. Extreme care will be required to fit whole humans through.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=Frogs and wrens jangle their voices, safe among reeds.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=Otherwise, the air is creeping quiet.
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_speech=[white]So therein lies your hope. Whatever the Thrixl are doing \nwith your people--shepherding them all to Terrafract?-- \nI can only guess, but it is likely slow, slow work.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_narration=The trees pack wetly in. The stink of putrified plant matter furls thick in noses, summoning snot. Puddles of mucus-like muck among the roots bloog and quiver.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hunter=Wouldn't mistake that for a fox den.
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_hunter=<hunter.villainEcthis_2_1_MothmanTalk:Mothman said there was a couple ways down./Didn't the Mothman supposedly say there were several ways down?>
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_leader=[small]<leader.villainEcthis_2_1_MothmanTalk:Right./So I heard.>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_narration=A rotted hole at the base of a tree twists into fetid darkness.

~01~prompt~panel_011~3_mystic=Well, <leader> and I <mystic.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/poet/romantic/80:should take another entrance, then? The less predictable we are, the higher our probability of success./[face:interested]could find another route? Maybe smart? Especially if... \nI mean we're not sure how the Thrixl will react, right?/[face:interested]could find another mudpit to slide in? Maybe that'll confuse them a little?/[face:talking]could find that alternate path, then. Cast a wider net, maybe catch more lives?/[face:grim]should sniff out another entrance, then. That way we can smash these bugs between us./[face:talking]will locate another entrance, then. If we're more spread out, we'll have a greater opportunity to contain the situation./[face:talking]would maybe do well to find another entrance, right? A wider net can catch more lives./[face:talking]could break in through another tunnel. Here to rescue as many as we can, right? Cautious approaches are selfish, at this point./[face:grim]could loop around and find another entrance. Cover more ground. Hopefully not instantly die?>

~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_narration=They soon discover a slick stairwell in the overgrown foundation of some forgotten structure.
