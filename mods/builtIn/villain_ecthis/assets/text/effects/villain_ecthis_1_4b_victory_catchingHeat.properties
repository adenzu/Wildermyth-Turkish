~01~~panel_001.(deadHero_is_missing)~3_bookish=Think so.
~01~~panel_002.(deadHero_is_missing)~2_warrior=While we have light? Yeah.
~01~~panel_002.(deadHero_is_missing)~5_mystic=Getting out of here might be smart.
~01~~panel_003.(deadHero_is_missing)~1_narration=Silence wraps their party, until trudging steps start to sound like unsaid words.

~01~~panel_006.(deadHero_is_missing).(mystic_is_villainEcthis_unrequited)~2_bookish=I want to say that... this journey's been the most confusing, most...
~01~~panel_006.(deadHero_is_missing).(mystic_is_villainEcthis_unrequited)~3_mystic=You have a thing for \n<warrior.mf:him/her/<warrior>>, right?
~01~~panel_007.(deadHero_is_missing).(mystic_is_villainEcthis_unrequited)~4_bookish=Well, I...

Fine./How'm I going to say this?>
~01~~panel_009.(deadHero_is_missing).(mystic_is_villainEcthis_unrequited)~5_mystic=<mystic.personality:[face:talking]Obstructing that was never my intention, it's only... Well, <warrior>, how do [i]you[] feel about <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>>?/[face:interested]I didn't realize it at first, but I kind of... I think I knew? Maybe I'm making that up. But, uh, <warrior>, how do [i]you[] feel? About <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>>?/[face:talking]You know it's... I mean, what am I going to say? You should both do what you want. <warrior>, how do [i]you[] feel? About <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>>?/[face:skeptical]I'm not blind. I'm also not going to sink effort into someone who doesn't want me back. So... <warrior>? How do [i]you[] feel about <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>>?/[face:talking]I told you I wouldn't let it get in the way, and I won't. But, sorry, <warrior>. This is insane, isn't it? Do you even have feelings for either of us?/[face:skeptical]Aside from the fact that I [i]told[] you I was into <warrior.mf:him/her/them>... ugh. It's alright. But I mean, <warrior>, how do [i]you[] feel about <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>>? Because maybe.../[face:talking]It's alright, it's not the strangest thing that's ever happened. <bookish.mf:<mystic.mf:Two brothers/A brother and sister/Two siblings>/<mystic.mf:A sister and brother/Two sisters/Two siblings>/Two siblings> pursuing the same <warrior.mf:man/woman/person>. But <warrior>... [i]your[] feelings are what matter./[face:grim]It's fine, just say so. Who am I to get in the way? It's always been up to <warrior.mf:him/her/them>, anyway./[face:happy]Believe me, my insides are all tangled, my thoughts directionless... but I wouldn't stand in your way. <warrior>? Do you have feelings for <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>>?/[face:interested]Honestly? It's frustratingly poetic. <bookish.mf:<mystic.mf:Two brothers/A brother and sister/Two siblings>/<mystic.mf:A sister and brother/Two sisters/Two siblings>/Two siblings> pursuing the same <warrior.mf:man/woman/person>? <warrior>, um, how do [i]you[] feel about <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>>? Remember there's also me./[face:talking]Look, it's al[i]ready[] annoying. Let's resolve it now: <warrior>, how do [i]you[] feel about <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>>?>

If I must make it plain and stated.../[face:sad]And I just... can't believe you're cornering me like this, because I hate the idea of being... but, um.../It's troublesome, but along the way... you know how a coin falls in a crack and you can't pinch it out?/[face:happy]And look, choosing one or the other of you is stressful. And it's [i]hard[], if you're giving me choices, I always tend to go for both.[bookish.face:dubious][mystic.face:skeptical]/[face:sad]Wasn't my intention to cause trouble between you. Or to fall for anyone, honestly. But being that it's out in the open, now.../My rule is just, if you're going to do something, \nyou do it all the way. So, I.../You're both distracted by this, and we can't afford that. Not now. I guess it's been on my mind, too. Apologies, I'll say it plainly./[face:skeptical]I rarely think about the 'hearts' of people, but it's sort of been... it's been infecting me, I guess. All the... and.../I think of the way a <warrior.mf:stag/doe/deer> picks <warrior.mf:his/her/their> way through a forest, leaping away at the rustle of feet, terrified to be caught, or even to be [i]seen[].../Flattering as it may be, serving as the crown in a dispute between <bookish.mf:<mystic.mf:my two princes/my prince and princess/two royally foolish siblings>/<mystic.mf:my princess and my prince/my two princesses/two royally foolish siblings>/two royally foolish siblings>.../I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to tread carefully, but I'm a clumsy idiot who's mostly just interested in <warrior.mf:his/her/their> vengeance, at this point.>
~01~~panel_011.(deadHero_is_missing).(mystic_is_villainEcthis_unrequited)~5_warrior=<warrior.personality:...then, yes. It's true. The way I preemptively \ndecided I wouldn't, I've fallen for <bookish>.[face:skeptical]/...No, fine, here it is: here it is. I've decided to say... Yes. I fell for <bookish.mf:him/her/them.> For <bookish>.[face:interested] Along the way./That's kind of how my feelings... have sort of fallen into <bookish.mf:him/her/them>. \nInto <bookish>. And yeah, sorry for comparing you to a crack[face:happy]./[face:scared]I don't mean [i]that[]! Not in [i]this[] case! I'm just exp--look, it's <bookish>. It was always going to be <bookish.mf:him/her/them>. Sorry. But also not sorry./<bookish>. I [i]have[] begun to think of you... That way./[face:happy]Yeah, I'll be blunt: <bookish>, I've decided to marry you someday./I've carried <bookish>'s name in my chest for a long time, I think. And I'm ready to commit to that. Love, companionship... if <bookish.mf:he/she/they>'ll have me./[face:skeptical]I [i]am[] experiencing... feelings. For you, <bookish>. I don't know... what to [i]do[] with that? But. I./[face:happy]That was how I felt about the possibility of love. But... I looked up at <bookish> today, and I realized... I'd already been caught./[face:happy]This dull, damaged heart of mine... belongs to you, <bookish>. I'm starting to think it was always [i]meant[] to./So, truth? I want to kiss <bookish>. Kiss <bookish.mf:him/her/them> so much. If that's enough, then, yeah. I'm falling for <bookish.mf:him/her/them> hard.[face:grim]>

This whole conversation, I was just going to say it's someone [i]else's[] turn to do the dishes!/[face:happy]Wow, you kind of stole my thunder. But look. I just think we'd be good together. We'd keep a good house, we'd.../[face:happy]No, wait, back up! Slow down! I want to say it! I practically am in [i]love[] with you, already. I... think I [i]always[] was!/No, I mean. Sorry. Thanks.

I'm...\nI think I'm in [i]love[] with you?[face:skeptical]/[face:happy]I... wanted to say that first. That I'm falling \nfor you, I mean. That I fell for you, uh.>
~01~~panel_015.(deadHero_is_missing).(mystic_is_villainEcthis_unrequited).(bookish_is_goofball)~6_bookish=And by that I mean. I like you too, <warrior>. A [i]lot[]. Sorry.

You two, why don't you walk together? \nYou can get me drinks when we get home to <town>!/[face:happy]I'm glad for you, then. And you know what? You two \nshould walk together. I'll give you room to talk./[face:talking]So talk. Get to know each other. And let's \nput more distance behind us before evening./Pulled together, across time and circumstance. I'm glad. I am.\nYou two walk ahead, I'll give you room to talk./[face:happy]Hey! No making your <mystic.mf:little brother/little sister/kid sibling> cry! You want me to start weaving garlands? Why don't you two take the lead, and I'll be right behind./[face:skeptical]See? And now it's over with. So you two should walk together, I'll follow. Out of earshot, if you don't mind./[face:grim]Why don't you two take the lead, then? \nTalk. I'll give you some time.>
~01~~panel_017.(deadHero_is_missing).(mystic_is_villainEcthis_unrequited)~1_bookish=Along a weatherstruck road, two wandering hearts find their paths have washed together.

But.../I want to say something, but first of all, I realize it's not a good time. And I realize you maybe just see a <bookish.mf:boy/girl/kid> from your hometown./I... Alright, I'll say it, but let me first just say it doesn't have to shake anything up, if you're not in the same place. But, um.../[face:sad]Ideally, I'd want to tell you this after a night dancing, drinking. But maybe this all had to happen, in order for.../[face:skeptical]If it's dumb, it's dumb, but here it is...>
~01~~panel_020.(deadHero_is_missing).(mystic_NOT_villainEcthis_unrequited)~4_bookish=<warrior>, I want you to know that...\nI think I've fallen for you.

We're taking chances on our lives, at this point. How can I keep chickening out?/[face:happy]And this is serious, alright? I know you probably look at me and see a clown in a dress, holding a stick and talking about handshakes with the goose-spattered rocks and things, but I swear I.../And I'm kind of known as a bit of a greedwagon, right? I get that. But since I was a kid, and you... I looked up to you. I wanted to be someone [i]you'd[] want. And I'd honestly give up anything else.../So, and like I said, I recognize that now we're, you know, throwing ourselves through tunnels of teeth, fighting mythic monsters, and... but I think it would be worse to say nothing./I know I'm probably out of line, and more calculating <bookish.mf:guys/ladies/folks> would wait for a quiet moment, or a... Look, I just know... I'm the kid that had a crush on you a hundred years ago. It lasted all this time. So why not longer?/And so, yeah, what I don't want is to make this journey we're on any worse. So if you want me to shut up, I will. But losing that feeling... I can't promise I will. Not any time soon./[face:interested]And... I... can't believe I'm... so I guess I had a crush on you as a kid. I thought it was buried. Now I realize there's never been anyone else I've even... thought of. Like that. Um. Just say no, and I won't talk about it again./You know, I've heard love on the road is as unconstant as a moonbeam. But this feeling in me... it's an old, ever-present star I'd stopped noticing in my sky. Since we were younger, and there were spring dances. I.../[face:interested]You probably don't know. That when I was a kid, you were the older <warrior.mf:boy/girl/kid> who filled my chest with hummingbirds, you... I remember a dusk dance. Candles and fireflies. Mally Mays married Mona Scarrow, and you danced with me. Laughter-lit. And.../[face:neutral]But you should probably reject me.
