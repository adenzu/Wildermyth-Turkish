~01~~panel_014.(hook_is_villainEcthis_dream)~4_hook=You once told me you were responsible.
~01~~panel_015.(hook_is_villainEcthis_dream)~1_speech=[white]Call it an accident of fate, little owl. \nPerhaps, one day, I will explain in full.
~01~~panel_016.(hook_is_villainEcthis_dream)~2_speech=[white]And you wish to know why. You wish to hear about the beginning.
~01~~panel_016.(hook_is_villainEcthis_dream)~4_hook=For the troubles we're in. And Eluna seemed to blame you.
~01~~panel_017.(hook_NOT_villainEcthis_dream)~4_hook=See, I heard you claimed to be responsible. For the whole thing with Eluna, for this conflict we're all wrapped up in.
~01~~panel_018.(hook_NOT_villainEcthis_dream)~4_hook=Haven't stopped wondering what that might mean.
~01~~panel_019.(hook_NOT_villainEcthis_dream)~2_speech=[white]You wish to hear about the beginning. \nTo decide how you feel going forward.
~01~~panel_020~2_hook=<hook.ecthis_Elsee:[face:grim]Is it true, then?

But I'd prefer to understand./[face:talking]Maybe it's water under the bridge. \nI'm not here to complicate anything.>>
~01~~panel_020~3_speech=[white]There is time for the quick version. You will have to fathom a far younger Yondering.
~01~~panel_021~2_hook=How long ago do you mean? \nHow old [i]are[] you?
~01~~panel_021~3_speech=[white]Old enough that your great-grandparents never heard of my family. And they would have, had they been born in the right era.
~01~~panel_022~2_speech=[white]My father got called a King by the overfond. Really he was a leader of Militia. He began that way, raising defenses against the <randomA:hordes of the Shadowgod./predations of the winged Empress./clattering hordes./crawlers in the wild.>
~01~~panel_023~4_hook=Thrixl?
~01~~panel_024~2_speech=[white]No. Back then, <randomA:we didn't think about Thrixl. Deepists, is what they called themselves, and still do. Sowers of sorrow, preying on the weak and disheartened. Insidious and everywhere, in that age./it was Drauven. Organized and full of conquerlust, they reduced towns to ash, took flocks, crops, and all they wanted. An ugly time. But not impossible for stout warriors to stand against./clockwork spiders swarmed out of the mountain holes. Bone-giants awoke in the woods. You see them still, though not in like numbers. Terrible, inscrutable beings. But human strength can break them./our famous foes were hillbeasts. All driven mad and tortured into monstrous forms. People swore they were leashed to subtler, more reclusive masters. And so, I now know, it was.>
~01~~panel_025~2_hook=<hook.ecthis_Elsee:[face:interested]So [i]you[] were human, too. But you're talking kings and castles.../<hook.personality:[face:interested]So you were fully human, then. Inhabiting a world of kings and castles./[face:skeptical]Sounds incredible, really. Not sure how it would even look.../[face:happy]A prince in a big fancy castle. Fairly standard storystart!/[face:talking]Wealth and prominence. I keep saying we can... but... um, sorry, go on./[face:interested]Has to feel good. Providing a castle for your kid to grow up in./[face:skeptical]Raised that castle, huh. You lived there? Sounds like the proper life./[face:happy]Can't help but approve of the man already. And you lived in that castle?/[face:skeptical]Hard to imagine. Castles all brimming with people. Hm./Like fantasies from a novel. A people's king. A prince and a castle./[face:happy]You were a prince in a Paladin's castle./[face:dubious]A prince in a big fancy castle. And this isn't made up?>>
~01~~panel_025~3_speech=[white]On the twinned might of my father's blade and his bland gruff goodness, my family rose to wealth and prominence.
~01~~panel_025~nameTag_3=The Mothman
~01~~panel_026~2_speech=[white]Yes. Such things were more possible, then. I was born amid a bounty of books. Was taught to sew. Given beautiful, brilliant examples to follow. My parents both wished peace for me.
~01~~panel_027~1_speech=[white]But legends roved the roads. Walkers of myth who painted the hills and protected the meek. They moved in number and skill heretofore unmatched. I was simply a boy, resembling more my mother: yet I wished so desperately to be like my father's heroes.
~01~~panel_027~2_npc2=[i]At bay[], you thing!
~01~~panel_028~2_speech=[white]At bay was a popular attack phrase, in those days. Truly a golden age.
~01~~panel_029~2_hook=So when do things turn?
~01~~panel_029~3_speech=[white]Oh, not long after I went wandering.
~01~~panel_030~1_speech=[white]I embarked in secret, knowing my parents would try to dissuade me, and knowing I would likely sway with even a thumbspush of well argued wisdom. I was unbrave.
~01~~panel_030~2_speech=[white]Pardon me? Is this [i]your[] story?
~01~~panel_030~3_speech=Cowardly, that's called.
~01~~panel_030~4_speech=<hook.hothead/loner/snark/60:I'm just saying./It isn't./Mine's shorter./Sorry!>
~01~~panel_031~1_speech=[white]I possessed no useful talents. All I had \nwas desire. It is all a young man knows.
~01~~panel_032~1_speech=[white]...In any case. What I wanted was to be <npc.fullname>. <npc.mf:He was/She was/They were> a dazzling country knight. Dauntless, irresistable, strong. I admired <npc.mf:him/her/them> from afar.
~01~~panel_033~1_speech=[light]It happened that I discovered a ruined room, buried deep in the Rosegirdle. Filled with strange weavings and crossed with threads and patterns I found entrancing and impossible.
~01~~panel_034~2_hook=A door to the other side.\nAnd you just went through?
~01~~panel_035~1_speech=[white]And that is how I found my very first Glimrseen.
~01~~panel_036~3_speech=[white]I fell through. Unwittingly, I bore what you now call the mystic's gift, \nand I believe it obeyed my curiosity. A quester's feet write his fate.
~01~~panel_036~4_hook=<hook.ecthis_Elsee:That the same as [i]her[]?/Sounds like you were caught. Same way Eluna was.>
~01~~panel_037~1_speech=[white]Eluna was abducted. The Thrixl\npurposed her passage.
~01~~panel_038~1_speech=[light]I was merely unlucky. I got tangled in nets not strung for me.
~01~~panel_039~1_speech=[light]<hook.villainEcthis_dream:You remember Terrafract?/Terrafract.> The Thrixl world. That is where I wound up. Lost and seeking the night sky, my eyes found a moon. A moon to lead wherever I would follow.
~01~~panel_039~2_speech=[light]Dayless years, it seemed, I spent mulling and meandering.\nIt is hard to know. But it could not have been [i]so[] long.
~01~~panel_040~1_npc2=[light]At some point, I began to think of myself as a moth: alone and fumbling towards the light.
~01~~panel_041~1_npc2=[light]Terrafract is not a dream. It [i]acts[] upon reality. It makes manifest what you imagine. For the unwary, this happens by accident.
~01~~panel_042.(hook_is_villainEcthis_dream)~1_hook=When I was in there... Eluna was working her own wishes on me. Is that right?
~01~~panel_043.(hook_is_villainEcthis_dream)~1_speech=[white]Indeed. You might have resisted, had I been less secretive from the start.
~01~~panel_044.(hook_NOT_villainEcthis_dream)~1_hook=<hook.personality:[face:interested]To true thinkers, discipline is [i]as[] important as intellect. A tutor once told me that./[face:interested]Is there any escaping it? Getting out unchanged?/[face:interested]It sounds like a carnival./[face:interested]A place we can realize \nwhatever we desire.../[face:neutral]Which quickly gets out \nof hand, I suppose./[face:grim]Sounds unfair. There's stuff I can't avoid thinking about./Could an ordinary but disciplined person survive?/[face:neutral]If [i]I[] was going to disappear... it'd be a place like that./[face:interested]So fear would be self-fulfilling. \nYou'd summon your nightmares./[face:interested]A place we can realize \nwhatever we desire.../Everything's more or less an accident, I'm deciding.[face:neutral]>
~01~~panel_045.(hook_NOT_villainEcthis_dream)~3_speech=[white]Monsters crowd every corner of the human mind. Those forced beyond the Glimrseens, lacking the ability to navigate and manipulate their mental geometries, are quickly lost to the horrors of their own margins.
~01~~panel_046.(hook_NOT_villainEcthis_dream)~1_speech=[white]So prone are we to passion and spiral that any momentary fancy is, in effect, degenerative.
~01~~panel_047~1_npc2=[light]This gift of mine... I can blame it for bringing me to the other side. But once there, it saved me from faring far worse. And then my abilities began to blossom.
~01~~panel_048~2_hook=Is it just... luck? Blood? <hook.bookish/loner/60:[face:interested]I suppose there could be any number of factors that differentiate a mystic's makeup from that of a standard person. But.../[face:neutral]I guess I always knew <hook.mystic:\nI was different from ordinary people./mystics were \na little different from ordinaries. Or from me.>/I mean, I never thought a person with \nmystic ability was really [i]so[] different from... ordinary people.>
~01~~panel_048~3_speech=[white]It is the essential split in our natures.
~01~~panel_049~1_speech=[light]<hook.mystic:Interfusion is a word you use. You have that proclivity, and may recognize you always did. /The principles of interfusion... are you familiar with them? A mystic has the proclivity before they comprehend it.>
~01~~panel_049~2_speech=[light]<hook.mystic:For packing away the permanence of your [i]self,[] even and especially while sharing form and energy among your surroundings./For packing away the permanence of [i]themself[], even while sharing form and energy among their surroundings.>
~01~~panel_050~3_speech=[white]That is what makes <hook.mystic:you and I passable worldwalkers./us passable worldwalkers. >
~01~~panel_050~4_speech=[white]Merely passable.
~01~~panel_050~6_hook=Passable?
~01~~panel_051~1_speech=[white]There is a limit to how definitely and for what duration our minds may preserve any image. Even the image of ourselves...
~01~~panel_052~1_speech=[light]Our inner identities shift over time. And so it was that by the time I had realized how to return to my own land...
~01~~panel_053~1_speech=[light]...I was quite transformed.
~01~~panel_056~3_speech=[white]Oh, I disagree. There are few things so productive as disappointment.
~01~~panel_056~4_hook=They say you should never meet your heroes.
~01~~panel_056~nameTag_3=The Mothman
~01~~panel_057~2_speech=[white]Regardless. Some memories are moons in the mist, diffuse and shapeless. They may as well be glowing gas.
~01~~panel_058~3_speech=[white]I will spare you the details. Of the encounters and events that come after: some \nare maudlin, some are mirthful, but most are motheaten and old beyond mattering. \nThat era is dead, and I am still here. Such is more or less my story.
~01~~panel_059~3_speech=[white]Responsible?
~01~~panel_059~4_hook=Alright. But why does this all make you...?
~01~~panel_059~nameTag_3=The Mothman
~01~~panel_060~2_hook=When you crossed the Glimrseen?
~01~~panel_060~3_speech=[white]The Thrixl took notice of me.
~01~~panel_060~nameTag_3=The Mothman
~01~~panel_061~2_hook=[i]Bored?[] So you poured\nbeer on a beehive?
~01~~panel_062~1_speech=[white]When I started toying with them. Kicking their sandcastles and causing a din to disrupt their operas. I had grown bored, you see.
~01~~panel_063~3_speech=[white]I thought it was funny.
~01~~panel_063~nameTag_3=The Mothman
~01~~panel_064~2_speech=[white]I believe it is what drove them to duplicate my accident in another.
~01~~panel_065~3_speech=[white]I did not anticipate that. But I do not think \nI cared enough to anticipate anything. \nNot for a long time.
~01~~panel_066~8_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/snark/60:/[face:dubious]//[face:angry]///>
