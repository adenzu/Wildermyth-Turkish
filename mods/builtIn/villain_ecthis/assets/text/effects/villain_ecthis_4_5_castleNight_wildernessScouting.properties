~01~~panel_001~1_narration=No beacons have led <hunter.exists:them/<hook.mf:him/her/them>> here. No flashes or columns of disappearing dust have marred the <season> sky.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=But graygreen fog wreathes a nameless castle.\nA growing host of Thrixl haunts its stones.

~01~~panel_005~4_narration=<hunter.exists:/Remarkably, none of the Thrixl appear to have entered the castle. The Mothman might be holding them off.>

~01~~panel_006~5_hook=<hunter.exists:/Patience might not be enough.>
