~01~prompt~panel_001~3_hook=Can't you just explain?
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=<child.personality:[face:interested]Forgot what a hike this could be, is all./[face:skeptical][i]I'm[] not slow. [i]You're[] fast./[face:dubious]Maybe if I was half my weight./[face:skeptical]I'm not big. [i]Or[] old./[face:grim]It's just [i]early[]./[face:skeptical]Huh? Early hill-climbs \nisn't mystical, it sucks./[face:skeptical][i]Thrixly[], huh? I'll try not to disappoint.../[face:grim]Apparently, no. You [i]can't[] explain./[face:skeptical]Uh, alright./[face:skeptical][i]I'm[] not slow. [i]You're[] fast./[face:dubious]Watch it.>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_child=<child.personality:[face:neutral]I train myself up here. It's the first time anything like this's occurred. You'll want to see it./[face:interested]You're... I mean, it wouldn't be bad if you'd hurry a little. I'll explain if it's not there anymore./[face:happy]You know I pictured, when I told you, that you'd [i]fly[] up here. Those things not functional, or what?/[face:skeptical]I came to get you for a reason, you know? Is the big old hero really whining about a hill?/[face:interested]I'm not sure I could. Sorry, I climb this hill every morning. Want me to fetch some water?/[face:talking]You're this great and powerful mystic, right? Not even that much older than me. Why the complaining?/Well, I'm not sure I could. Struck me as [i]Thrixly[]. Figured you'd have the best idea what it might be./[face:neutral]I'm up here every morning. Today, \nit seemed like... I wasn't alone./Explanations would be imperfect. I do my predawn thinking up here. Today I saw it, clear as an ember on the early sky. I only hope it hasn't dimmed with sunrise./[face:interested]What did words ever capture better than our waking eyes? I only spotted it today. Which... also... can you hurry at all?/[face:skeptical]You could probably go faster if you flap those things.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_child=[face:interested]But the glow... is still out there. See?
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_hook=Where am I sup... oh.
~01~prompt~panel_005~4_child=Little south of... yeah.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_narration=A greengray smudge disturbs the distance.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_child=[face:interested]What do you think, <hook>? Is it [i]something[]?
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_hook=Well, Elsee, I'll tell you what...
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hook=I think it's [i]him[].
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_ship=The old Mothman?
~01~prompt~panel_009~4_leader=Would he advertise his position like that? Plainly, out in the day? It's not his style.
~01~prompt~panel_010~6_hook=Sure, but why do people burn flagleaf? <hook.bookish/coward/healer/hothead/loner/60:Distress outweighs subtlety./[face:interested]We grow desperate enough.../[face:interested]Everyone needs help, sometimes./Get in over their heads./They have no other option./A cry for help would be his last resort, I'm sure.>
~01~prompt~panel_010~8_ship=<ship.bookish/hothead/loner/60:If it's him, I dislike how... [i]undisguised[] it is./[face:happy]I'm always up for a trip. Let's go see./[face:grim]Ugly way to treat a <season> sky./[face:neutral]Wouldn't be hard to follow...>
~01~prompt~panel_010~9_leader=Certainly looks similar to the signal he raised when we were looking for you.
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_leader=Even so, Elsee Arcwright's the one who called your attention to it, right? Remember who her sister is. You have any reason for believing it's our Mothman?
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_hook=It's almost like I can read his signature... in the shade of that light... can feel him calling out to me.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_speech=[white]One day, I shall come and tell you everything.
~01~prompt~panel_014~3_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/healer/hothead/loner/poet/60:[face:talking]Attachments aside... understanding the significance of this new sign is imperative, isn't it? Whether it's bad or good./[face:interested]We're sort of limited in our options though. Right? What do we do if we [i]don't[] investigate?/[face:interested]Unfortunately, we're sort of forced to investigate. Right? Or else we won't know anything./Way I see it, we're tied to the ox. Good or bad, we have to go. To know what's out there./[i]Someone[] should go. Otherwise it'll just be one more thing we don't know./Regardless, we're like the wave-watching gull of fable. Until we fly out to find what shines, we'll be wracked with wondering./I don't see what choice we have. Good or bad, we have to figure out what it means.>
~01~prompt~panel_014~5_child=Um.
~01~prompt~panel_014~7_leader=<leader.krfln.hook:You kind of have a point, huh?/Weirdly, I agree./Well, when you put it that way.../[face:interested]I agree, love. I do. But.../That's a fair point.>
~01~prompt~panel_014~8_narration=Elsee enters quietly from outside.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_child=<child.bookish/coward/hothead/loner/60:Perhaps it's intrusive of me to try and say anything, but.../[face:interested]Hate to be interrupting \nor anything, but, um.../[face:skeptical]Yeah, so [i]I've[] decided. I have to help him./[face:grim]I'm not one of you. But I'll just say.../[face:interested]Tell me if I'm speaking out of turn, here. But I feel like...>
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_child=This Mothman... his intervention is what led to my rescue, right? And the others you saved? Let [i]me[] go. I've been training for this. I owe it to him.
~01~prompt~panel_017~3_hook=Elsee...
~01~prompt~panel_018~4_leader=<leader.personality:[face:interested]I do always say there's no logical defense for blinding oneself to the truth. Alright. I suppose some of us should make the trip./No, you're right, <hook>. To sit here not knowing would be worse, wouldn't it?[face:neutral] Alright then. Who's going to go?/[face:happy]I do like the idea of coming to [i]his[] rescue for once. Should we wear hats? I could find us hats.../[face:talking]He's a strong ally, <hook>. If an ally's really what he is. So yes, I agree it's in our best interest to chance it. Incur his favor. But which of us'll be on the hook if it's a mistake?/Yeah, I can't say no to helping him... if it [i]is[] him. But I guess the only way to know is to check, and he's earned that much from us.[face:talking]/Yeah, when it comes down to it, I'd rather not sit here punching my toes. Whatever we meet out there, we've shown we can handle it./You're right, <hook>. While none of us can say where that man's loyalties truly lie, it'd be selfish of us to become skeptics when [i]he's[] the one in need./Yeah, listen. I've got my own reasons to want to fight, still. I bet everyone does. So if it's Thrixl waiting, I welcome that outcome. Maybe even[face:grim] hope for it./Hm. I'm leary of being lured around again. But you're right, <hook>. Confusion kills, and that's all we'd be left with, sitting here on our hands.[face:interested]/[face:happy]Rescues are becoming our specialty, I suppose, and I [i]would[] be pleased to see him safe. He's an oddity, but he's started to appeal to me./[face:skeptical]Guess I'd hate to miss the chance to save Old Smuggin's life. Alright, <hook>, let's all go together.>
~01~prompt~panel_019~3_ship=We did.
~01~prompt~panel_019~4_child=Hey. Did you hear me?
~01~prompt~panel_019~6_leader=Yes.
~01~prompt~panel_020~3_hook=But <leader>, she's ready.
~01~prompt~panel_021~4_leader=<leader.healer/leader/loner/60:Elsee, you're a kid, still. And the things that're out there.../You're too green for this.[face:grim] You'd get killed. Sorry, but it's the truth./[face:neutral]I'm ignoring it because it was a pointless suggestion./You don't want to go out there, Elsee. We bleed out there. Face nightmares. It's...>
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_child=Do you not trust me?
~01~prompt~panel_023~3_hook=Elsee's experienced things that might've broken any of us. She's survived, she's worked and made herself strong. We don't have to send her by herself, but maybe it's time to bring her along?
~01~prompt~panel_025~4_child=Well... I understand. That you're fighting my...\nwho [i]used[] to be my sister. But I...
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_child=I've grown up in a different world than you. You fought the battles, yeah. But us, we... we all suffered. That's not your fault, it's just... We didn't get a choice.
~01~prompt~panel_026~nameTag_3=Elsee Arcwright
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_child=I'll tell you, when we were down there, it all felt inevitable. \nOne by one, our doom would devour us. Turn us into monsters.
~01~prompt~panel_028~4_child=But my memory of that time is... blurred. I remember the hideous blue light, the hidden purple door, and the... the smell of rotten leaves. My sister's voice.
~01~prompt~panel_029~4_child=I'm not afraid to invoke her name: Eluna. She promised I'd make it home again. And thanks to you, I'm here. Today I'm ready to choose my fate, and face the things that forced us to suffer, forced my sister to change. So please...
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hook=<hook.coward/loner/60:[face:interested]She deserves her chance, doesn't she? I could look for a weapon for her...?/I've heard enough, I'll vouch for her. You, I'll go find you a proper weapon./[face:talking]She deserves her chance. Come on, Elsee. Let's find you a weapon.>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=Bring her along.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Well why don't you stay and do some research or something? Some extra study...?/[face:interested]I'm sorry. Thing is... there's too much that could go wrong. For you and for us./[face:interested]Sorry. I... uh. I just don't think I trust you to choose [i]us[] over your sister. In your shoes? I wouldn't.../Thing, is... can't afford mistakes. Can't accept extra risks. You get it, right?/[face:grim]Look, this isn't your proving ground. Other lives are in the balance. Sorry./You can follow your own path. Doesn't make sense to take you down ours./Maybe I'm terrible, but I don't want to be worrying about you. Sorry./[face:grim]Sorry. I know waiting's hard. Give it a few more years.>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=Leave her behind.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~2_child=<child.personality:You have my gratitude. Truly. And... I'm cognizant of the price I could pay./[face:interested]Earnestly, and I mean seriously, I... sorry, I won't be a distraction. And thanks./[face:neutral]Thanks. And hey, if nothing else, I could be decent to use as bait, right?/Thanks. I honestly mean it, I'll [i]earn[] my place./Thanks. I honestly mean it, though. I'll do everything I can, and I'll [i]contribute[]. If I don't, just tell me to disappear, and I will./[face:grim]I'm not going to thank you. Because I plan on saving [i]all[] your lives. You'll see./[face:grim]I'll be a shield, an arm, a life to stand in front of you. That's my promise. I'll live up to it./[face:grim]I would've gone alone if you'd denied me./[face:skeptical]Maybe I'm green, but I'm tough as weeds. I'll at [i]least[] stand in the way./[face:talking]I have hopes for my future. And I know it's thanks to you I've got one, so... trust me. We'll all be alright. /[face:skeptical]Yeah. And hey, if nothing else, I could be decent to use as bait, right?>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~5_ship=<ship.hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:talking]I like your bluster. Won't matter until you face down a mantis, though./[face:neutral]You'll be measured by your actions, Elsee. \nWelcome. And good luck./I guess that's that. Perform well and no one's doubts will matter./You walk into the fire that burned you. That takes bravery. Good luck./[face:skeptical]You're courageous, I [i]will[] say that. Welcome, then. And good luck./[face:skeptical]I won't raise a big fuss, I guess. But no turning against us \nat the final, pivotal moment, alright? \n/[face:interested]Welcome, then, Elsee. Don't be in a rush to prove yourself is all I can say.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_narration=<hook> helps Elsee find a piece she's comfortable wielding...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_narration=...and soon, the company's assembled, pursuing the strange signal that glows, fades, and reappears beyond the hills.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~3_hook=<lover.exists:Here we go again, <lover>./<hook.personality:[face:talking]Mind its relation to landmarks. If it vanishes, we'll have to maintain our bearing, blind./[face:interested]And another horizon we might not return from./[face:interested]Oh! Anyone going to be mad if I go back for my lucky pin? It could mean [i]everything[].../[face:skeptical]Now listen, I bought a Goldcomb Cheese. If [i]anyone else[] breaks the wax on it, they'll wake up in a briar./I hope he's alright. And I hope we're doing the right thing. I hope, I hope, I hope./Hate this feeling. Can't slow down. No one needs a rest today, alright?/[face:talking]Keep track of landmarks. We may have to remember the position blindly, if it completely vanishes./If anyone goes slow, they get left behind./Every horizon hides a hundred ways to die. Don't lose your eyes entirely to the sky./[face:neutral]<hook.villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:Mom would say fate is folded by the measure of each horizon. That's what I'll say now./<hook.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero:Mom would say fate is folded by the measure of each horizon. That's what I'll say now./My heart tells me this's right.>>/[face:skeptical]Yeah, at least maybe we'll get to save Old Smugginmoth. That'd be worth it.>>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~4_lover=<lover.exists:And again, we'll come home together./>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~10_ship=<leader.krfln.ship:<leader>'s right on this one, Elsee. Be patient. Your time'll come./I actually agree with <leader>, here.[face:skeptical] Whatever that counts for. You need more time./<leader>'s right on this one, Elsee. Be patient. Your time'll come./I'm with <leader> on this one, Elsee. Not just because it's <leader.mf:him/her/them>, but because <leader.mf:he's/she's/they're> right. Your chance [i]will[] come, someday. But it's not today.../For whatever it's worth, I think I feel the same way <leader> does. Sorry.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~8_narration=Without another word, Elsee turns on her heel...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_narration=...and walks out.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_hook=She'll try something on her own.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_leader=<leader.coward/goofball/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]I don't think she's understanding \nwhat she'll encounter. Do you?/[face:interested]You think so? Hard for me to tell. Should I have kept my mouth shut?/Probably.[face:grim] That's what I'd do./[face:dubious]Trying is easy. Accomplishing anything... [i]that'll[] prove more difficult./Wouldn't necessarily blame her. And if everyone else wants to overrule me, they can.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_hook=<leader.coward/goofball/loner/snark/60:[face:skeptical]Maybe not. Maybe she'll turn around when she does./[face:dubious]You're asking that question [i]now[]?/Keep our eyes open, I guess./It'll prove [i]dangerous[]./I'm just worried...>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_narration=Soon, the company's assembled and underway, pursuing that strange signal that glows, fades, and reappears beyond the horizon.
