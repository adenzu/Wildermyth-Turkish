~01~~panel_005~1_narration=They give much of a day to climbing and slipping among Kyoren rubble.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=The lines and leanings of these ruins make it easy to lose focus and wander. From time to time, they're forced to call out in order to find each other.

~01~~panel_013~3_warrior=<warrior.hothead/60:[face:grim]You mean let's get to the point, right? I agree./[face:skeptical]You have something to share?>
~01~~panel_014~1_speech=[white]<warrior.hothead/60:How very obliging./Have I not made that clear?>

I must stop with these lengthy introductions. Here it is, then.>>
~01~~panel_016~1_speech=[white]Dauntless and wanderlorn by my very nature, the idea was a weathersown seed. I felt called to take myself <warrior.directionTo.site:north and farther north,/north and beautifully east,/into the temperate east,/south and well east,/far south, where roseplums grow wild,/south and breezingly west,/into the ill-tempered west/north and windingly west,/==> and that is how I happened upon these chicks of yours.
~01~~panel_017~1_warrior=You [i]saw[] them!?
~01~~panel_018~3_speech=[white]I saw them there, huddled, and afraid, and dwindling in number. It is not a good place, where they are.
~01~~panel_019~1_hunter=And you didn't help them?
~01~~panel_019~2_speech=[white]You seem to assume I can walk into any den of Thrixl and simply rifle through the cupboards. I [i]am[] flattered, but must humbly admit my talents have eventual limits.
~01~~panel_020~2_speech=[white]Remember your own limits, too, precocious birds. Your enemy is well beyond you.
~01~~panel_020~3_warrior=<warrior.coward/goofball/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]We [i]remember[]. We always \nremember.

~01~~panel_021~2_speech=[white]<warrior.coward/goofball/hothead/loner/snark/60:You see no conscionable alternative? Very well./What pluck! I am nearly convinced. Very well./I will not. But your point is noted. Very well./You stoic old stroose. How peppy! Very well./Spoken like a myrtle-haired stroose. Very well, then./Fire metaphors? I have tarried much too long.> By <site>, <warrior.directionTo.site:north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/==>, in the woodmarsh. An ancient Glimrseen lies in a hidden hollow.
~01~~panel_021~3_hunter=Glimmer-what?
~01~~panel_022~2_speech=[white]Glimrseen. I shall explain more in a moment. But first, here. You must look for trees with my mark on them. I leave it now, upon this stone...
~01~~panel_023~1_narration=The Mothman's glyph gleams to a certain tilt of the light.
~01~~panel_024~2_hunter=I know the old <site.station>, and the woodmarsh. \nIt's a long journey, but it's makeable.
~01~~panel_024~3_warrior=...and then he went his own way. If there weren't lives in the balance, I'd say we should be tracking that Mothman instead.
~01~~panel_024~4_bookish=Yes, but, Glimmer-[i]what[]?
~01~~panel_025~2_narration=The [white][b]passage of time[][] will cost lives. \nBut [white][b]clearing Thrixl sites[][] will disrupt the \nenemy's webs, and help more folks survive.
~01~~panel_025~4_narration=They leave as soon as they can.\nEvery idle moment is haunted by loss.
