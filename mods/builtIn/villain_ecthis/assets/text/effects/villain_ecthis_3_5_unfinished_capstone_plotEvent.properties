~01~~panel_007~1_ship=<ship.krfln.hook:<ship.pcfn.hook:You can sleep here tonight, if you like. Know your own bed might be a little strange to go back to./It's fine. Seems like you... don't want to sleep back in your own own home, yet, huh?/[face:talking]Was coming to say... you can sleep here, tonight. Your room, your bed... might not feel safe to you, right? It'll be like old times./=-=>/[face:talking]Just wondering, I guess. You sleeping here, tonight? Probably hard to go back to the bed where she was able to [i]reach[] you./[face:neutral]Wanted to say... you should sleep here. You'll feel better, I'll feel better. Don't sleep in that bed where she can seemingly [i]reach[] you./[face:grim]Wanted to make sure you didn't go back to that bed where she... I mean, I don't know. I [i]don't[] know. But just stay here, tonight./[face:interested]What? No, I... Sorry, I was just going to see if you needed anything. Not going to sleep in your old bed just yet, I'm guessing.>
~01~~panel_008~3_hook=<hook.personality:[face:neutral]It's more a feeling than a studied decision. \nBut I can't help it./[face:interested]Hadn't cons... huh./[face:interested]Hadn't cons... huh./[face:grim]Wasn't even going to ask./[face:talking]Seems I'm particularly vulnerable. And I understand that... makes me a point of vulnerability to [i]you[], as well./[face:skeptical]I'm not [i]scared[]./[face:neutral]Kind of you./[face:skeptical]Just came to get a drink. But I guess I might just spend the night. It's easier./[face:grim]Yeah, it'd be like trying to go to sleep with a fat black spider on the ceiling.

~01~~panel_009~4_ship=What's... oh.
~01~~panel_010~2_hook=<hook.personality2:[face:interested]I just think it's oddly inconsistent behavior for him. He never stepped in so [i]directly[] before./[face:sad]It's on me. This whole thing.

My [i]life[] is borrowed, I feel./Who knows how ugly I'd be. Or [i]what[] I'd have turned into. He saved me from that, I think./Doesn't make sense. Why he'd jump in for [i]my[] sake. Or how he even...>
~01~~panel_011~4_ship=He appeared, that morning. Told us where to wait. We were close, but we would've been out of reach.
~01~~panel_012~4_ship=Planted some kind of [i]beacon[] to guide us. Then said he was off to make sure you wouldn't be late.
~01~~panel_013~2_hook=<hook.personality:Him interfering directly, like that. That's inconsistent. I wish I [i]knew[] more./Thought I was doing something brave. It was just stupid./Thought I was pretty smart./Don't like feeling indebted to him./I ought to have helped him./I was just... so [i]taken in[]. That's why I'm mad./I let everyone down./I don't understand./If I could go back. <ship>. If I could go back./Wish I'd done [i]more[]./Annoying.>
~01~~panel_014~5_ship=<ship.krfln.hook:[face:talking]Got to let people take care of you \nwhen they want to./[face:talking]Don't make me feel sorry for you. \nIt'd be bad for our dynamic./[face:grim]We can all do better. \nBut we're not beaten./[face:grim]Don't let it hang over you. \nA lot of living for us, still./Any idea what's next?>
~01~~panel_015~3_hook=<ship.krfln.hook:[face:interested]/[face:happy]Heh./[face:grim]Maybe./[face:neutral]Yeah.../...Nothing. Maybe.>

~01~~panel_016~4_ship=Well, but if Eluna's... if this [i]Ecthis[]'s some kind of Queen of Thrixl, now... are we in [i]more[] trouble? Or less? Does she want us dead? What [i]does[] she want?
~01~~panel_016~5_hook=Walk outside with me.
~01~~panel_018~2_hook=<hook.villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<ship.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero:Mom warned us, right?

~01~~panel_018~3_ship=<hook.villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<ship.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero:[face:interested]I [i]do[] remember that, yeah./[face:neutral]>>
~01~~panel_020~1_hook=Eluna and the Mothman, they're beings of a similar order, now. Closer to each other, I think, than we are to either of them. \nBut they're different in this respect: he's [i]afraid[].
~01~~panel_021~4_ship=And she's not?
~01~~panel_021~5_hook=She's...[face:skeptical]
~01~~panel_023~1_hook=I don't think she's got any [i]reason[] for fear.
~01~~panel_024~6_hook=Eluna, Ecthis... she's unattached. In a way, maybe, unfinished. And I think she sees us [i]all[] that way. I just wish I'd been able to listen. A little longer. Her voice is...

~01~~panel_028~1_narration=The peace that comes will be a balm to many. Six more years they can shovel onto the bones of bad memories and good friends.
~01~~panel_028~2_narration=But some are unable to forget. Their blood, their bodies remind them. \nTo them, the dragging seasons will peel up scabs, and they'll continue to listen for rumor of Eluna or the Moth.
