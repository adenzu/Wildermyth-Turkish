.blurb=<hero> has a story.
.longName=Can We Talk About This?
.name=Tidings
~01~~panel_001~1_narration=<bookish> and <mystic> made a rapid study of anything they could find. \nAnything that might relate to the Thrixl, or their aims.
~01~~panel_001~2_mystic=What is it, Cricket?
~01~~panel_001~3_bookish=Hey, little <mystic.personality:mole/chicken/duck/cat/pup/goose/wolf/bear/owl/fox/frog>. Hey, <mystic>...
~01~~panel_002~1_mystic=Talking about our mystical... whatever? \nI hear you. Uh. For me it's...
~01~~panel_003~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/greedy/hothead/leader/loner/poet/60:Possible we're missing a clue that's buried in our blood. Is it all linked to the manifestation of our powers?/We're powerful, now. This is our calling, and our gift, our opportunity. Even amid all the bad that's happening.../Maybe we should just make a guess. Stop thinking, start [i]acting[]. Our powers came from nowhere. Maybe we have to trust them?/With our power comes responsibility. It's easy to get lost in that, but remember that you're young. We [i]both[] are. Can't always fix it all./These people weren't always kind to Mom and you. But this power... makes me feel [i]responsible[] for them. I don't like it. What about you?/When I look inside myself... do you wonder if it's connected? All this, the Thrixl, the power. Maybe Mom?/The power we've discovered... feels so sudden. And dangerous. We'll be able to stay on the right path, won't we? I worry about myself. And you.>
~01~~panel_004~2_mystic=<mystic.personality:I think it all [i]could[] be just a confluence of unrelated conditions and events. You know how I am, though, I'll generally look for a pattern, or any kind of order. I think I have to establish some foothold of [i]understanding[]. And I don't have it, yet./Well, half the time, I'm just daydreaming about being normal again. Tell you honestly, the more time we spend thinking, the further from the truth it feels like we are./Well, and it takes the joy out of being magical. All the ruin, the death, the missing ones. I don't know if I've ever felt this focused. I think there's some answer we're definitely missing, but... but./Knowing the value of a thing is the only way to make a good deal. Right? That's part of what we're trying to assess, right now, in my eyes, is what price we can expect to pay. And our lack of knowledge is going to kill us, if we move too quickly./We saved our town. The old folks. Should be able to think about other things, but my mind just keeps returning to the lost ones. They're out there. They were [i]taken[]. And if we don't choose wisely... It's everyone we ever [i]knew[].[face:sad]/[face:grim]Whatever abilities I've got, I'll use. Whether that's to anyone's good or not... I don't know. But if we turn up nothing, and save no one, there's always time for vengeance. I think I'd be good at vengeance, if I had no better path./In books, you read about powerful people failing to overcome their selfish impulses. The Oldwanes, for instance. I expect we'll need to fight that battle, if we're going to be effective against whatever else comes. Thrixl. All the rest./Ultimately it comes down to a private decision. How we each choose to use our ability, our life... that's our business. We don't belong to anyone else. Mom thought that was important./Questions are easy, I just wish I could provide any answers. You know I struggle with decisions. Picking an ideal path. And that's when I have more information. We're travelers trying to set a course without a compass. I [i]do[] miss Mom./I keep thinking about how... alright, so if these aren't the final throes of our people... then the legends they tell afterwards will be about us. Don't you think so? The decisions we make now will be songs someday. That's high in my head, these days./I don't know. Feels like a card game, where you're just drawing the top card, hoping for the best. Still think we have to be decent judges of the deck, and keep our eyes on the dealer. But I mean.... what can we hope to really know, in the end?>
~01~~panel_004~3_bookish=Hm.
~01~~panel_005~3_mystic=Disagree?
~01~~panel_006~1_bookish=Oh. No. My mind wandered. I'm just worried. \nDays are passing. I'm not finding anything useful.
~01~~panel_007~1_mystic=Yeah. Me neither.
~01~~panel_008~1_bookish=Hm.
