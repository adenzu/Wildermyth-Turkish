~01~~panel_035~1_speech=[white]A regular rabbit might have run himself raw, but, no, I am cleverer and more winged than that. I stayed only as far from her grasp as was necessary. And then, wandering Terrafract, I at last found one unguarded Glimrseen. One gap was all I needed.

~01~~panel_038~1_speech=[white]Yes. A summer house, from long ago. That was where I thought to go next.
~01~~panel_038~2_hook=You were hunted. So you left us assurance of your identity, and you left that Glimrseen behind.
~01~~panel_039~1_speech=[white]Some places stay fixed in the mind. I knew I would not have long there before they followed. From what you told me, you were quite close as well. I am sorry. I was fighting senselessness.
~01~~panel_040~1_speech=[white]Indeed. I left you a map. And I went home.
~01~~panel_040~2_hook=<volunteer.exists:/But you changed your strategy. \nYou knew where you were going next.>

~01~~panel_042~1_speech=[white]Yes! I am a prince!
~01~~panel_042~4_hook=But does that mean...?
~01~~panel_044~1_speech=[white]It was a long time ago.
~01~~panel_045~1_speech=[white]A long buried time.
~01~~panel_046~1_speech=[white]My advice to you, dear bird<volunteer.exists:s/>... Do not outlive all you have loved. Your idle talons will turn to mischief, and your mischief will damage those with something still to treasure.
~01~~panel_047~3_speech=[white]In any case. I do not merely seek asylum, but also am here to give warning: \nour Ecthis, your Eluna, she will ruin this world if she is not stopped. \nThe delicate caveat is... stopping her may be impossible.
~01~~panel_048~1_speech=[light]Her powers are beyond mine,\nand her body is beyond death.
~01~~panel_049~1_action=[kelly]THROOSH!!
~01~~panel_050~6_hook=Can I ask... maybe we could just... talk it out? Make peace with her?
~01~~panel_051~3_speech=[white]Perhaps an appeal would work. But I would strongly urge you to have a second plan. You will not face her twice.
~01~~panel_052~6_hook=<hook.villainEcthis_dream:My memory of her... is that she didn't intend harm. I honestly didn't fully understand what she intended./Present company excluded, she hasn't decided to hurt anyone, right? You could say we've all given her a reason.>
~01~~panel_053~3_speech=[white]From what I am given to understand of her aims, she intends to remake the animal-- the human animal--in the image of herself. <hook.villainEcthis_dream:<hook>, you were her first try./We saw the beginning of that work already.> She will evoke a great change in the blood of all our kind. Across this and all Yonderings.
~01~~panel_054~2_volunteer2=<volunteer2.exists:But what does that even mean?/>
~01~~panel_054~3_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:Is that something she can do?/>
~01~~panel_054~5_hook=<volunteer.exists:/Is that something she can do?>
~01~~panel_055~3_speech=[white]She told me [i]a[] plan.
~01~~panel_055~6_hook=And also... like, how do you presume to know? Sorry. But, <volunteer.exists:we're/I'm> supposed to believe she told you her plan?
~01~~panel_056~1_speech=[white]She is a thoughtful one. And\nshe tried to make me see.
~01~~panel_057~2_npc4=[white]We both contain immensities.
~01~~panel_057~3_speech=[white]And smallnesses.\nAnd hypocrisies.
~01~~panel_058~2_npc4=[white]Some more than others, yes. But they're things we never would've comprehended, left alone.
~01~~panel_059~2_npc4=[white]Tell me it's not [i]your[] story as well. I only ever saw flaws, weaknesses in myself. Now I know those were doors, waiting to be unlocked. You shouldn't be fighting me, you should be at my side, helping it happen...
~01~~panel_060~1_speech=[white]You certainly have no obligation to credit my story.
~01~~panel_060~5_hook=Her goals sound... sort of benevolent, though, don't they?
~01~~panel_061~3_speech=[white]In her future, it is the gifted<hook.villainEcthis_dream: ones, like her, like <volunteer.exists:<hook>/you>... and/, like her... and> perhaps the mystics and potential mystics among you. They inherit the world.

~01~~panel_064.(npc_is_gender-neutral)~3_speech=[white]Everyone else will fade into poor violent sorrowers like those you have been forced to put down.
~01~~panel_065~1_speech=[white]That divide does not make her happy. \nBut it will not make her stop.
~01~~panel_066~1_speech=[white]I am sorry. I am still quite exhausted. \nA big gloomy hole is what I need.
~01~~panel_067~3_speech=[white]No protection will keep her off us forever. I thank you deeply for sheltering me, and if I must go, to draw her ire off your necks, I will blithely go. If you intend to fight her... you will have my aid. Goodnight.
