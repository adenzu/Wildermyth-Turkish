~01~~panel_001~1_narration=This pocket of wilderness has long been considered too remote to matter on maps.
~01~~panel_003~1_speech=[white]Not to mention, it is [i]exceedingly[] craggy.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=<leader> follows what appears to be a slice made by snowmelt, narrow and twisting round the granite hips of these mute giants.
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=The mountains don't have names. Thin fog stains the sunlight pink, and leaves a faint taste of salt on licked lips.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=It's a surprise to <leader.mf:him when he climbs/her when she climbs/them when they climb> up again, onto a wide level field.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=On the far side, a cliff. But before that...
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=...a lightmottled tower.
~01~~panel_007~1_bookish=<bookish.exists:<bookish.bookish/goofball/poet/snark/60:Have to admit, my rational side was telling me to mitigate my excitement. But there it is. Somehow almost looking pristine./[face:talking]I've seen pillow forts that looked more impressive.../"The teeth of Old Kyor were scattered from its head.

Built for utility, not beauty./[face:interested]Isn't it kind of [i]creepy?[]/[face:happy]Stubbier than I would've expected./Less extravagant than I hoped./Everyone's done well. I mean, that we're here to see it. It's an achievement./[face:talking]So it's time to bust it open, or what?/[face:grim]Everyone's effort helped us get here. Wits, strong arms, urgent feet. We can do what seems impossible./So quiet. Shame we had to find it, almost./I'm growing convinced that we live in our world's darkest age./Two [face:interested]sorcerers built this place. In love. In danger. And lived to walk away? I hope. And that's how I'll tell it. Uh, but.../[face:dubious]Now, watch, we won't be able to open it.>
~01~~panel_008~3_speech=[white]I find it beautiful. But then, it is one of the few new sights I have beheld in a hundred years.
~01~~panel_009~2_leader=<leader.hothead/leader/loner/60:Better not to wait. Let's try the door./I'm going to say we should assemble here first, before we try and enter./Would it be better for one person to try and go in? I can do that./Guess we should assemble here first. Before we try and get in?>
