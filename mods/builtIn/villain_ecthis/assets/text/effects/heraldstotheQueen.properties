~01~~panel_001~1_narration=By the predawn hour, the Mothman has holed himself inside the tower. Thread by thread, he dismantles the wards that have let them escape notice, across flights, fights, and campsites.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=Ecthis will catch any small glimmer of his presence, he thinks.\nToo obvious, and they might alert her something's amiss.

~01~~panel_003~2_leader=They're patient. Taking stock. We look half-prepared to fight, which the Mothman said is a good enough ruse.
~01~~panel_004~1_hothead=Erm... is that a ruse?
~01~~panel_005~1_leader=<hothead>... the battle's only meant to draw [i]her[] in. Winning really just means surviving, for now.
~01~~panel_006~1_hothead=<hothead.ecthis_Elsee:Yeah. I know our target. [gray]I'm just... I'm not sure we're any more than half-ready./I [i]am[] aware what we're... I just... <hothead.bookish/coward/hothead/loner/poet/snark/60:Feel we're missing something. Every strategist probably knows that feeling, huh? Ah well. They say a doubting arm wobbles the shield./All this running we've done. Feels like the end, is all.[face:interested]/Guess I'm just anxious to try her. We haven't yet had the pleasure./Not natural to go into a fight, trying to let your enemy through. This feels... [gray]kind of scary./Hard not to feel like snakes smug in our own coils. Waiting to bite at the wheels of a thundering wagon./All this running we've done. Maybe I've gotten too used to it.[face:skeptical]/Yeah? Yeah, anyway, it's fine. I'll do my part. We'll all make it through... one more day.>>
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=Her heralds will come before her. But if these companions can [b][white]protect the Mothman[][] long enough, the queen herself may be called to the field.[]
