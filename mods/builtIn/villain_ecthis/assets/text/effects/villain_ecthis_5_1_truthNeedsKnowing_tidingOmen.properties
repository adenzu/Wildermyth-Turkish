~01~~panel_004~3_speech=[white]...in the case we cannot find it quickly enough. But I agree that is a risk we may have to run.

~01~~panel_005~1_warrior=How early were <hunter.exists:you all/[i]you[]> up?
~01~~panel_006~2_bookish=Never went to bed.
~01~~panel_006~4_speech=[white]I do not [i]require[] sleep.

~01~~panel_008~8_warrior=Well, anyway, <hunter.exists:we/I> took the woodpath and picked up some kindling. <hunter.exists:/Sounded like you had travelnews.>
~01~~panel_008~9_hunter=Sounded like you had travelplans.
~01~~panel_009~7_bookish=Yeah, I think we're heading out. <bookish.ecthis_bookTrio:<warrior.villainEcthis_prodigalWarriorHero:You remember this book, <warrior>./This book. For me<mystic.villainEcthis_fromHometown: and <mystic>/>, it was the how the whole mess started.>/It's this book.>

~01~~panel_012~7_bookish=Here, you read it. Start where my thumb was.
~01~~panel_013~1_warrior=[i]"The binding words were wrung from our throats, our lungs were leeched of air."

~01~~panel_016~1_warrior=<warrior.bookish/goofball/poet/romantic/60:[face:interested]Kyoren. How wonderfully abstruse. "[i]But when Azdyurmayn shook me, and my fearing eyelids found the courage to unclench, she was smiling. And the thing was done./[face:happy]A wizard-name, you mean. "[i]When Azdamoss shook me, and my fearing eyelids lifted, she was smiling. And the thing was done./[face:talking]What a musical sound. "[i]But when [darkPurple]Azdyurrmayn[] shook me, and my fearing eyelids found the courage to unclench, she was smiling. And the thing was done./[face:happy]Oh, wait. These people must've been lovers.

The thing was done./[face:talking]Right, well, [i]"...when Azdurmon shook me, and my fearing eyelids lifted, she was smiling. And the thing was done.>" []
~01~~panel_017~2_warrior=[white][i]"Blasted into the foundingstone, the runic script of our entwined souls: smoky words that would elude even the most dreamfluent and wishing-wise, and any who did not share my blood or my wife's. So the seal was made sure."
~01~~panel_018~1_warrior=[white][i]"Thereafter, a tower did we raise: our Tower of Locks. From within, no being could go without--and from without no being within--save when, by our will, the door were unbarred."

~01~~panel_019~4_narration=<warrior> lets the old Kyoren book softly close.
~01~~panel_019~5_hunter=<hunter.exists:/>
~01~~panel_020~3_warrior=<warrior.hothead/greedy/romantic/snark/60:[face:grim]Alright. So they made a tower that they could hide in. What do you all want? We do something similar?/[face:interested]Imagine that... a great tower of your own, and you can govern who goes in or comes out. And... but so, you all think there may be some kind of artifact, or mystical treasure there? Something to fight with?/[face:skeptical]It's a sweet, upsweeping story. Two Kyoren sorcerers, in love, locking the world out of their tower. Though.../I mean, so... they built a tower that could keep anything in, or anything out? Right? How crafty./[face:interested]So, if I understand, this married couple from Kyor crafted a kind of legend-worthy spell. And it meant they could decide who enters or leaves their tower? That's... a compelling story. But...>
~01~~panel_021~2_bookish=<hunter.exists:/[face:talking]We're thinking if we can find the place... maybe that's what we do. We trap our Ecthis inside.>
~01~~panel_021~5_hunter=<hunter.exists:[face:talking]I think <bookish><hook.exists: and them are/ and <mystic> are> thinking... we find the \nplace and trap Ecthis inside? Or is that wrong?/>
~01~~panel_021~6_mystic=<mystic.villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:My knowledge of Old Kyor's decent. And the Mothman, too. He/The Mothman here> says it's possible.
~01~~panel_022~2_speech=[white]Accepted history has it that the Ancient Kyorens engaged in a centuries long struggle with the Thrixl. Most theorize that is what ended Kyoren civilization. We learned such things, growing up, though 'Thrixl' was only a monster from the rhymes.
~01~~panel_023~3_warrior=But wait, really? That's our plan? Lock her up in a fancy, magic prison?
~01~~panel_024~2_speech=[white]Being honest, it is a long, almost targetblind shot. But time ebbs, and I doubt we can protect our presence if we stay here.
~01~~panel_025~7_bookish=[face:skeptical]Problem is we don't know where it is. Or if it works. Or how we open it. Or how we coax her inside. Or if it even exists in the first place.
~01~~panel_026~2_speech=[white]What [i]I[] know is that we stand no chance of winning a direct duel. I also know that Kyoren records are lauded for their accuracy, and when this story struck my ear, I could not help feeling it had the ring of truth, and the familiarity of a well trod tale forgotten.
~01~~panel_027~1_speech=[light]I believe it [i]is[] out there, this Tower of Locks. And my beliefs are as good as your certainties, little birds.
~01~~panel_028~3_warrior=That's quite a claim.
~01~~panel_029~1_speech=[white]I am quite a Mothman.
~01~~panel_030~1_narration=A bulging gust tries to bust the window.
~01~~panel_030~2_action=[tan][actionSmall]throbble!
~01~~panel_030~3_action=[gray][actionSmall]ker-clunk!
~01~~panel_031~4_bookish=Alright. <bookish.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/snark/60:It's a daunting thing to undertake, but at least we're moving, and I'm certainly intrigued by the outcome. Everyone?/[face:interested]Do we have time to prepare? How long? Maybe it's better we just go?/[face:talking]Now if only we were the birds you say we are, we could travel the wind and be done by <season+1>tide./We can afford everyone a chance to get ready, but I'd think we should be off soon./Well maybe we can tie ourselves to kites and travel faster./[face:grim]Well, let's be on the road, then. Almost luck, maybe, that we haven't had long to get used to our beds.>
~01~~panel_032~1_narration=They depart before noon, seeking rumor and riddle's key, \ntraveling always with protective shrouds cast round.
~01~~panel_032~2_narration=But any night's wind feels like it might rip away their fortunes.
