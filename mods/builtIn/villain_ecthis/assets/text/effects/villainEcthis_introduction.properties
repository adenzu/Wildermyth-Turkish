~01~prompt~panel_016~3_mystic=[small]<bookish.personality:Never saw it before. Maybe just an alternate way of writing it?/Aren't all what? They're not standard Kyoren words.

I'd think this's one of a kind./The people of Old Kyor. Hmm. Suppose it might just be fantasy?/You're an idiot. This mantis-guy would slice you.[face:skeptical]/Old Kyor was a thousand years, yeah. I mean the fall of it./Mm. Yeah. If I'm right, the descriptors used here imply, like... a kind of [i]horrified[] respect?/I can figure out most of it.
