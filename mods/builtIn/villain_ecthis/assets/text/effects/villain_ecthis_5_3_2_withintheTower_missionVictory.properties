~01~~panel_001~1_narration=Creeping silence.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=Mystic light.
~01~~panel_001~3_narration=The shadows are crammed with decayed bits of molting. Age-thick air only freshens as a questing draft slips bravely behind them.
~01~~panel_002~1_mystic=<mystic.exists:<mystic.healer/leader/60:<deadHero.exists:Dear price we've paid for this place. Hope it was worthwhile.\n/<maimedHero.exists:Alright, all the serious wounds need quick attention.\n/Managed that without any serious wounds. Good.\n>May not be long, now, before we see her.>/Want to run through the rooms again. But I \ngot a good feeling we didn't let any escape./In another timeline, that might've been our great nemesis. In this one... just a mad hornet in the closet.>/>
~01~~panel_002~2_hook=<mystic.exists:<mystic.healer/leader/60:<deadHero.exists:/>/[face:interested]At least the big one's... not moving./<deadHero.exists:Deadly sting on this one, <mystic>./Pretty [i]sizable[] for a forger-bee.[face:neutral]>>/>
~01~~panel_002~3_hook=<mystic.exists:/[face:sad]Maddened enemy of Old Kyor... why did they deserve your venegeance? <deadHero.1><deadHero.3.exists:, <deadHero.2>, <deadHero.4.exists:<deadHero.3>, and <deadHero.4>/and <deadHero.3>>/ and <deadHero.2>>.>
~01~~panel_003~2_hook=<warrior.exists:<warrior.ecthis_Elsee:[face:interested]My guess is we'd already be surrounded, were that the case./[face:interested]Right. Those looked like the eyes of a beast locked away for a thousand years.>/>
~01~~panel_003~3_hook=<warrior.exists:/<mystic.exists:<deadHero.1><deadHero.2.exists:, <deadHero.2><deadHero.3.exists:, and <deadHero.3>/>/>. Have to make our stand without <deadHero.2.exists:them/<deadHero.1.mf:him/her/them>>. All we [i]get[] from this... is we know the place [i]works[]. That thing was thousand-years mad.[face:grim]/[face:grim]I'll be brave, among your shades, my friends. Today, we've proven this tower serves its function. Only a thousand years of fury could've brought you down.[mystic.face:grim]>>
~01~~panel_003~5_warrior=<warrior.exists:<warrior.ecthis_Elsee:[face:skeptical]Do you think Eluna knows? That we're here?/[face:skeptical]So... this seems to prove the myth.>/>
~01~~panel_004~3_speech=[white]His fall resounds. Like the felling of a mighty redwood. In my headforest, it echoes.
~01~~panel_005~5_mystic=<mystic.exists:<mystic.villainEcthis_dream:[face:interested][i]I[] could feel that. Like wind on my wings./[face:skeptical]>/>
~01~~panel_005~6_hook=<mystic.exists:<mystic.villainEcthis_dream:/<hook.villainEcthis_dream:[face:interested][i]I[] could feel that.

~01~~panel_006~1_warrior=<warrior.exists:<warrior.bookish/coward/greedy/hothead/poet/romantic/60:You make it sound frustratingly alluring, being you. But... this disturbance. Ecthis'll likewise feel it?/So what do we do now? Think she'll come, once she feels that disturbance? I mean did she feel it? Should we be hiding?/[face:skeptical]But this's a tower rife with Kyoren magic, probably. So I mean... couldn't that maybe block the noise? Or something?/[face:grim]This disturbance. Ecthis is going to feel it too, I assume?/That's a thought-planting sort of idea. Mm, but, to the point at hand... this disturbance. Ecthis probably feels it too?/[face:interested]A rhyme of today would tell of the heroes who slew Kyor's destroyer. But... mm. Sorry. Let me ask. Is this going to catch [i]her[] notice?/This disturbance. Ecthis is going to feel it too, I assume?>/>
~01~~panel_006~2_mystic=<mystic.exists:<warrior.exists:/And so... Does it give away where we are, you think? To our own, enemy, who can sense such disturbances the same as <mystic.villainEcthis_dream:us?/you?>>/>
~01~~panel_006~3_hook=<mystic.exists:/[face:grim]You might've helped. You might've saved them.>
~01~~panel_007~3_hook=<mystic.exists:/That's a tough sell, right now.>
~01~~panel_007~5_speech=[white]<mystic.exists:Whether these walls might muffle such a booming spirit... it is too soon to know. Regardless, the time nears that each bird must find <hook.mf:his/her/their> perch in the storm./I am sorry. In fact, I was forced to focus on denying that beast's exit. It wished to flee, not face you. I hope you will believe me: its escape would have proven more disastrous, still.>
~01~~panel_008.(mystic_is_missing)~5_speech=[white]Their lives are dear, I know. The time nears that each bird must find <hook.mf:his/her/their> perch in the storm, and this is turning out to be a lonesome belfry we are paired in.
~01~~panel_009~1_hook=<mystic.exists:<warrior.exists:<hook.bookish/coward/healer/leader/poet/60:[face:dubious]Adroitly phrased, as always, even if your leaning on that metaphor has grown tiresome. But to the point of preparing.../[face:skeptical]Ever think it doesn't help our confidence \nthat you keep calling us birds?/I know you mean well with your talk. But I think there's a lot still to figure out. If <mystic.exists:<deadHero.exists:we survivors are going to make it through. Or at least accomplish our task./we're going to make it through without losses.>/you and I, and maybe an extra arm or two... are going to do what we set out to do.>/That's fine poetry, but we still have a lot to consider, don't we? \nHere, follow me for a second./[face:talking]We birds can't be clinging to perches, I don't think. Our wings must be worthy enough to flick us from the paths of thunderbolts. Batter away the rain./Alright, fine, and we'll look for nesting branches and all the good chicky things you want to say. But we still need to resolve some of the details.>/It's time to resolve the details. Not in exhausted \nmetaphors, either. I mean in plain words.>/In order for their sacrifice to matter... we need to resolve the details.>
~01~~panel_009~2_narration=<hook> walks past <mystic.exists:them/the Mothman>, \ninto the grand hall...
~01~~panel_010~3_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/healer/leader/poet/60:[face:talking]/[face:interested]And I mean... /[face:talking]/[face:talking]/[face:interested]/[face:talking]>It's good we managed to claim this place. Found it and opened it. All but showed it could do what we want it to. Killed the... whatever that was. Beast.
~01~~panel_011~1_hook=But see... isn't the hardest part still to come? Getting Ecthis here, convincing her to come inside this tower, and... well... not dying when she inevitably tries to [i]make[] us die? And then...
~01~~panel_011~2_speech=[white]<hook>. Be calm.
~01~~panel_012~3_narration=Outside, the mist rubs its pink fur against the cold blue rocks. No sudden threat sparks up.
~01~~panel_013~4_speech=[white]While the gravity of these problems may just now be weighing on you, I have concentrated almost expressly on constructing solutions. I trusted you all to find this tower, and you did not let me down. Now, allow me to ease your burden.
~01~~panel_014~2_speech=[white]Ecthis has hunted me relentlessly for years, has she not? <hook.villainEcthis_dream:Together we have deflected her gaze, with some substantial effort./<mystic.exists:<mystic.themePiece_mothWings_wings:Together, <mystic> and I have deflected her gaze, with some substantial effort./I have deflected her gaze with some substantial effort, and of course, aid.>/I have deflected her gaze with some substantial effort, and of course, aid.>>
~01~~panel_015~2_speech=[white]Now, what is left is merely to let our efforts droop, leave my winsome face uncowled. Who would you count on to resist me?
~01~~panel_016.(mystic_exists)~2_speech=[white]<warrior.exists:Ah, how pleasant it is to hear an angsty duck relish <warrior.mf:his/her/their> crumbs./Indeed, that qualifier went \nwithout saying, I thought.>

~01~~panel_016.(mystic_exists)~4_mystic=<warrior.exists:/[face:grim]I suppose what you mean is how could anyone not want to take a free shot?>
~01~~panel_017.(mystic_is_missing)~1_hook=[face:grim]
~01~~panel_017.(mystic_is_missing)~2_speech=[white]Well... to resist taking a swing, I am mostly saying.
~01~~panel_018~1_speech=[light]Ecthis [i]will[] come for me. You may have to draw her into the tower, but once inside, I shall exert the sum of my meager powers upon her. She will counter.
~01~~panel_019~2_speech=[white]I should be able to hold her long enough that you can close this door. And when the bar is snugly nested, there will be nothing more she can do. To you, or to anyone else.
~01~~panel_020~3_narration=<mystic.exists:/The stones of the tower make a pleasant sound, settling as the day heats up.>
~01~~panel_020~5_mystic=<mystic.exists:[face:skeptical]Well, but what about.../>
~01~~panel_021.(warrior_exists)~1_hunter=<hunter.exists:<volunteer.exists:We/I> combed through this floor, the upstairs, the basement. It's clean. It's sealed./>
~01~~panel_021.(warrior_exists)~2_warrior=<hunter.exists:/So that means she'd... this place'll be her prison. For eternity? How long will her life last?[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_022~2_speech=<mystic.exists:/[white]Her life here will be the same as her death.\nAnd by that I simply mean...>
~01~~panel_022~3_speech=<mystic.exists:[white]Her life here will be the same as her death.\nAnd by that I simply mean.../>
~01~~panel_022~4_warrior=<warrior.exists:<hunter.exists:<warrior.ecthis_Elsee:[face:grim]/>These walls, these confines. They will be her prison. How long will her life here last?/>/>
~01~~panel_022~6_mystic=<mystic.exists:<warrior.exists:[face:skeptical]/<mystic.ecthis_Elsee:[face:sad]/[face:grim]>Well. And this tower'll be a prison. How long will her life here... last?>/>
~01~~panel_023~1_speech=[light]...it will go on and on...
~01~~panel_024~6_speech=[light]...filling every room...
~01~~panel_025~6_speech=[light]...possibly without end....
~01~~panel_026~2_speech=[white]...and yet. That will be the happiest end. For all she loved, when love once ruled her.
~01~~panel_027~2_speech=<mystic.exists:/[white]You still plan on talking to her, first?>
~01~~panel_027~3_speech=<mystic.exists:[white]I agree. You must try it./>
~01~~panel_027~7_mystic=<mystic.exists:I do think... we have to try talking to her./>
~01~~panel_027~8_warrior=<warrior.exists:<warrior.ecthis_Elsee:[face:sad]/>/>
~01~~panel_028~1_hook=<mystic.exists:Yes, we'll make an attempt at peace. Even so... You [i]are[] our friend. And we [i]do[] trust you./[face:grim]I think... I have to try. Anyway thanks. And I [i]do[] trust you.>
~01~~panel_028~2_speech=[white][small]Of course, of course.
~01~~panel_029~2_speech=[light]Why else would you say so?
