~05~player_chose_two~panel_011~1_hunter=Oh, but...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_012~1_warrior=Do you know the [i]Thrixl[]?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_013~1_hunter=But, sorry. Anyway, came wandering this way and saw your fire. Have to tell you, forest is dangerous, these days. [i]Things[] have come crawling out of...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_014~2_mystic=<mystic.rfln.warrior:/[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:interested]>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_014~3_warrior=Have you seen them? Where? What can you tell us?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_015~2_hunter=[i]You[] know of them?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_016~1_hunter=Was tracking a whole threem of them. <hunter.personality:[face:grim]A brief glimpse was all I allowed myself. As you likely know, there's lore that says many died even for that much./Truthfully, for the short time I haunted [i]their[] steps... they'll haunt my sleep forevermore.[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]They're not your grandpa's Lostlings, I'll say that. They're real, and they're hideous, and memorable./Weren't threatening me, and I didn't want their attention, so I only caught the briefest glimpse of them./Didn't seem wise to catch them, if I'm being completely honest, and I traced their lines to a terrible conclusion./Menacing creatures, sure. I'd like to take one down. But even I can curb my battlelust in the face of such numbers./Nothing much I could do by myself, if I even knew [i]what[] to do. Sure an arrow or a knife might work, but not against so many./I keep to my own tract, mostly, and I'm certainly glad of that now./Discretion, as the saying goes, is often the better slice of hog. Limited my contact to tracing signs, and then got one brief, horrible glimpse./[face:skeptical]Like to think I'm the most dangerous thing in these woods, but I know it's just a cloying self-fiction./And what was [i]I[] going to do? They were plentiful as dandelions of the field, though not as comfortable to look at.> Their heading was unmistakable. <town>.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_016~3_bookish=Home.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_016~4_mystic=They're heading for our...?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_017~1_hunter=I was able to get around them, those Thrixl. Get a warning to the townsfolk. But going by the tone of their response, I doubt they fled. I don't think they believed me.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_018~2_mystic=Is this... [i]happening?[]
~05~player_chose_two~panel_019~3_warrior=How well do you know these lands?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_020~1_hunter=How well do I, <hunter.fullname>,\n[i]know these lands[]?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_021~1_hunter=<hunter.bookish/loner/80:[face:angry]I take [i]offense[] to that.\nBesides, I should clarify.../[face:grim]Didn't ask to be noticed. \nAlso, to clarify.../Sounds like me. Though, \nI should clarify...>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_021~2_warrior=You were that Hillpainter who'd come to town sometimes. <hunter.bookish/goofball/greedy/hothead/loner/romantic/80:Haunt the library, harass the printer./Didn't Gale Harper find you sleeping in the hogpen?/[face:skeptical]Peddling hill charms people would buy./Got into bottles, got into scraps./[face:skeptical]Brooding eyes. <hunter.awm:Girls/Boys> went nuts for that./[face:dubious]The talk of all the <hunter.awm:[i]married[] women/[i]married[] men>./I think I remember.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_022~1_narration=...that same night.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_023~1_hunter=I wasn't born among them, the Hillpainters. Was found in bad shape, rescued, and took to their way of life. Started collecting their lore, getting volumes printed, bringing it back to them.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_024~1_hunter=[face:interested]Yeah.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_024~3_warrior=Got them printed by <warrior.rfln.bookish:<warrior.rfln.mystic:Lyanna <mystic.lastname>?/Lyanna <mystic.lastname>?/<mystic>'s mother...?/Lyanna <mystic.lastname>?>/<warrior.rfln.mystic:Lyanna <mystic.lastname>?/Lyanna <mystic.lastname>?/<mystic>'s mother...?/Lyanna <mystic.lastname>?>/<bookish>'s mother...?/<warrior.rfln.mystic:Lyanna <mystic.lastname>?/Lyanna <mystic.lastname>?/<mystic>'s mother...?/Lyanna <mystic.lastname>?>> Now I see.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_025~1_hunter=[face:talking]Those two, <bookish> and <mystic>, were raised by the <hunter.bookish/hothead/poet/60:[face:sad]most splendid mind I've ever met. Having that woman for a mother, and losing her... would've left [i]me[] shattered./[face:angry]most gracious woman in the world. Can only imagine it left a fury in them, losing her./[face:talking]mightiest woman in the world. Like the story of the Bearlord, Usric... Losing her must've left a great rift in their souls./[face:grim]worthiest soul this side of the stars. I'll always think that. Losing her for a mother would break something in me.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_027~2_warrior=Mm, well... yeah. I had a teacher, far from here. \nCame from hillpainting people. <npc.fullname>?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_028~2_hunter=You clearly have something else you want to ask.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_029~1_hunter=<npc.firstname>? <npc.lastname>? No, sorry, it's no one I've heard of.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_030~2_warrior=<warrior.bookish/hothead/goofball/snark/60:[face:interested]As I'd suspect. It was the slimmest chance./[face:grim]Right. Why would anything go my way?/[face:neutral]Another coincidence would've been welcome./[face:skeptical]I hate myself for even asking./Right. It was too much to hope for.> Anyway... think you can kill Thrixl?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_031~1_hunter=Yeah, Thrixl. <hunter.coward/goofball/snark/60:[face:interested]Guess I have to be, huh?/[face:happy]I'm ready to try./Thanks for making it sound \nlike a choice./If that's what's needed.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_032~1_hunter=My adopted people have legends of [i]Thrixl.[]\nBut legends is all I believed they were...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_032~3_warrior=Do those legends include a Mothman?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_033~2_warrior=You too?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_034~2_hunter=<hunter.coward/healer/leader/poet/60:[face:interested]/[face:interested]/[face:neutral]/[face:talking]/>You going to say you met the Mothman?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_035~3_hunter=<hunter.coward/healer/leader/poet/80:[face:skeptical]Look, I believe a lot of things, so [i]please[] don't tease me./I have to believe you're pulling my leg. Right?/I have to believe you're pulling my leg. Right?/[face:interested]Rambleheaded I may be, but don't tease me./By all and any gods, you're [i]loopy[], aren't you?>\nThe Mothman, now that [i]is[] a tall tale.
