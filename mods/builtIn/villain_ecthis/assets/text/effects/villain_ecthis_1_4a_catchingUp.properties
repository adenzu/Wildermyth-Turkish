~01~prompt~panel_007~4_mystic=Oh, maybe, yeah. Problem is, there's two different letterings, and I'm good with one, but not the other. Need a desk and some workpaper...

A relic or a...?/<warrior>, something else: why'd you go to Eldstone, anyway? [face:skeptical]\nYou went there like you had a purpose./[face:neutral]Fine. But, <warrior>? There's a hundred quiet places you could've gone, even within the town limits. Why all the way to Eldstone?/My <mystic.mf:brother/sister/sibling>'s teasing you, I think.

~01~prompt~panel_009~8_warrior=The ruin? People said it was haunted.
~01~prompt~panel_010~5_warrior=Gloamlights, fleeting noises, disappearances. Rumors I heard as I made my way home. It sounded like a likely spot.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_narration=A storm catches their heels.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_warrior=In the end, I was half-right. The Thrixl [i]were[]\nthere. But <npc.mf:Master/Madam/Master> <npc> wasn't...

~01~prompt~panel_016~1_warrior=Is my memory lying? You both worked [i]magic[] in the ruin. Your mom's the lady who runs the printshop, Lyanna <mystic.lastname>, right? Does she know? Does she also have... powers?

~01~prompt~panel_020~11_mystic=Hm? No, yeah... Um.
~01~prompt~panel_020~9_bookish=[face:interested]Not even sure how to answer you, though. When do you call something magic? It wasn't like [i]using[] a thing... It was almost as simple as shaking hands. Like shaking hands with creation. Right, <mystic>?
~01~prompt~panel_021~11_mystic=Something feels off. \nDo you feel that?
