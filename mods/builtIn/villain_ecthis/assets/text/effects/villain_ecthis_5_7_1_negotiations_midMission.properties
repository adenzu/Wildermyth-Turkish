~01~~panel_004~2_hook=<hook.ecthis_Elsee/villainEcthis_dream:<hook.personality:Oh, Eluna. [face:interested]You do look indescribably... glorious. And yet, still like yourself, somehow. My mind takes me back to hearing your stories. And I'd cherish that again. But.../[face:sad]Don't talk to me like that, Eluna. I lost you, and I've waited forever... hoping... for... I don't know, but.../Eluna! Wow![face:interested] You've certainly changed, haven't you? But I mean, I've grown up too. See my [i]muscles[]? Yeah... but.../Oh, Eluna. [face:skeptical]You're saying that if I was more like you, you'd have come for me earlier? That's rough to hear, honestly. Because I mean.../Eluna. My Eluna. Ecthis, if that's what you want to be called. I love you. I miss you. No matter what form you take...[face:talking]/[face:angry]Eluna, stop this! You have the power, don't you? Are they controlling you!? We'll take them apart! And I'm just sorry, Eluna. That I was a kid. And I couldn't save you. But now.../Oh, Eluna. [face:grim]I remember you as the perfect big sister. Now you're just more perfect, and a little bigger, aren't you? But, sorry, I'm not as composed as I seem. And.../Eluna.[face:skeptical] Why don't I know... what I'm going to say? Hm. I guess I figured the words'd just come. Maybe it's just... You're my sister, and I love you still. And... but.../[face:grim]Eluna, you return to me like a longlost knight, bound in the enemy's armor. But you're still my sister. The humanity in you's not [i]gone.[]/Eluna.[face:interested] Didn't think I'd say this... Uh, you look [i]good[], though. I've grown up pretty fine myself. But... Yeah. But um.../[face:dubious]Do I still look little to you? Only because you're, like, a giraffe now. But sorry, uh... What do I say to you?>/<hook.personality:[face:talking]Frustratingly, I have this genuine... I don't know. Just a curiosity. To see everything you wish for. I guess the rational me understands the price we'd pay./[face:sad]No. I'm sorry, but there's no future I want to see, where everyone not like us... is just wiped out?/[face:happy]Yeah? Maybe you can give me just the neck, next time? No, I guess I'll stop you, first./You didn't ask me the first time. Why would I willingly put myself in your palm again?[face:skeptical] Whatever you give me, I'd never trust it's really mine./Please. [face:talking]Just look around at us, and at the fight we're willing to endure, to stop you. We have our own lives. We want to decide our [i]own[] futures./[face:angry]I don't understand! All that's happened, all this enlightenment you claim to possess...! You still want to wipe everything away?/You could've learned from all that's happened. It feels like... you've chosen this, now./[face:neutral]If you'd asked me the first time... Who knows what I might've said?/[face:talking]The wolf would call the <hook.mf:buck/doe/deer> ill-made. No ripping teeth? No spinefreezing howl? However, each is intended to live its own vibrant, wildly dissimilar life./[face:joke]Funny. Everyone wants to fix me. Until they kiss me, and find out I'm only broken in the right ways./[face:skeptical]Fix [i]me[]? Better take a look at my brain first, before you make those kind of promises. Yeah, and I'm sorry. You're being serious.>/<hook.mystic:<hook.personality2:[face:interested]You're smart enough to realize when you're making a threat. It's fine, though. I appreciate the subtlety./[face:skeptical]That... kind of just sounds scary? Maybe you meant it to, huh? That's fine, I'm sorry./[face:joke]Oh, yeah? What're your plans for [i]me[]? Always thought I'd make a handsome rockinghorse. Um, and I know that's not what you mean. Uh, sorry. Sorry./[face:skeptical]I don't know that I'd really trust you to paint my face, much less rearrange my body./[face:neutral]Even taking you at your word, I'm not interested in getting changed around inside. Not by you./[face:angry]How [i]dare[] you? You bring an army to crush everything I care about, then ask me to take bread from your palm? I'm not a [i]dog![] But.../[face:grim]You understand I take that as a threat, don't you? Huh. I guess I appreciate the subtlety./[face:neutral]Hm? Naw, but thank you. \nI've got my own way./[face:grim]You're wise enough to realize you're making a threat. Suppose I do appreciate the subtlety./[face:skeptical]Hm? I'm a lot more popular than you might suppose. So. I'm doing reasonably well./[face:skeptical]Consider me skeptical. I've made a \npretty big mess of things.>/We're natural enemies, you and I. I know the world you wish for has no one like me in it.>>
~01~~panel_005~2_hook=<hook.ecthis_Elsee/villainEcthis_dream:[face:neutral]Eluna, look. At me. We belong together. We always will. You [i]raised[] me, and I.../<hook.hothead.80:[face:grim]No. Let's, here and now, put it all aside. Ecthis? I'm saying we [i]have[] to./<hook.personality:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:happy]/[face:talking]/[face:neutral]/////[face:happy]/>But, Ecthis? We can still save each other.

~01~~panel_006~1_speech=[maroon]<hook.ecthis_Elsee/villainEcthis_dream:Oh, no. Elsee? No. You'll never belong in my world./Poor <hook>. You really wish for that. I can see it./I see how much you want to believe that. >
~01~~panel_006~2_speech=[darkGold]<hook.ecthis_Elsee/villainEcthis_dream:I experience an existence you can't guess about. \nThat rag you're holding out to me--yes, you call \nit love. But it's so lightless and gray./That Mothman shed his weakening lamp on your \nheart, and you find yourself fearing me, flinching.\nBut my desires are pure and strong as the sun./The truth is this world [i]asked[] for me. Existence \nwished me to be. So all things can become what \nwe're meant to become.>
~01~~panel_006~3_speech=[navy]<hook.ecthis_Elsee/villainEcthis_dream:If only you could see that. I'm sorry. Because I know... when all \nmy powers unfurl to bring life to its next plateau... you \nwon't be allowed along. I wish that wasn't so./When all my power unfurls to bring life to its next \nplateau... you [i]will[] be allowed to come along.

Then, \nyou'll take my hand, and you'll tell me I was right./you will not be allowed along. It's not \nbecause I hate you. I wish it wasn't so.>>
~01~~panel_007~1_speech=[light]But now... it's time to smear out the stumble-winged moth whose meddling has turned you from me.

~01~~panel_009~4_hook=<hook.ecthis_Elsee:No. I can't call you that, can I? My sister... she's choking. She's choking in the grip of [i]your[] hands. I may be simpler and less brave than she was. But she showed me that no matter what random, evil fate falls over you, you've got to face it with courage. And love./<hook.hothead/leader/loner/60:So... Yeah. You [i]are[] a mighty queen. You're exceptional. Random evil ripped you from everything you cared about, but you survived anyway. Thrived on your own. And that's all stuff I admire. But instead of respecting your power you've decided to abuse it./Here's my problem. You imagine yourself a queen. But all your people--[i]your[] people, I'll say--there's things that're in your power to grant. Peace, health, protection. Freedom from tyranny. And just.../See, I've actually [i]wished[] to be like you are. Random evil ripped you from everything you cared about, but you survived anyway. Thrived on your own. And that's all stuff I admire. Feels like, though... you haven't accepted yourself yet. So you want to make everyone else the same./Ecthis, you're unquestionably wonderful. I mean, I'm not even anyone who can really tell you that. The heights of power you've reached, the way you've--what is that, [i]transmuted,[] I guess?--your suffering into this beautiful, awesome form you wear. I admire all of that.>>
~01~~panel_010~2_hook=<hook.ecthis_Elsee:So that's what I'll do. I still love you. Whatever's [i]her[] in you, I love it so, so much. And as long as I'm breathing, and you're standing in front of me, I won't get out of your path./<hook.hothead/leader/loner/60:And see, you can hurt yourself if you want to. I can't make you stop. I mean, I [i]would[] tell you to cool it, because I'm not someone who just lets people be idiots. But when you try to decide for everyone how the future's going to go... that's where [i]we[] have a problem./You won't give us those things. All the good you [i]can[] do, you [i]won't[]. \nI was taught power's meant to [i]serve[]. It's meant to serve everyone. \nWe can't let someone rule us whose love resides only in the mirror./And see, I get it that you still have pain. And it's not my right to tell you how exactly to deal with that. Any and all gods listening will tell you I'm bad at it myself. But when you try to decide for everyone how their life's going to go... that's where [i]I[] have a problem./But Eluna, the girl whose life was robbed from her... she's still suffering. You've armored her and erased her feelings. But there was a lot in this world, she probably loved. Or would've grown to. I have no real right to talk. But I think it's true. So why? Why destroy it all?>>
~01~~panel_011~1_speech=[forest]<hook.ecthis_Elsee:That's fine. We may both stand right here, \nas long as you like./Enough. I hear all you say, and it only makes your human limits more obvious. All of you. Like newborns, your eyes don't recognize the light. Have patience.>
~01~~panel_011~2_speech=[navy]<hook.ecthis_Elsee:Or at least until the day is done. \nI require very little of you, Elsee./[i]That[] revelation, too, I now destine. \nReally, I'm only here to say this:>
~01~~panel_011~3_speech=<hook.ecthis_Elsee:[maroon]Just let my servants through./[maroon]Let my servants through.>
~01~~panel_012~3_hook=Oh, is that really all? You do seem to want that Mothman bad... Well no. Your bugs aren't getting near him. And neither are you.
~01~~panel_013~1_speech=[light]How can you hope to form a wall when you're so soft? So dull and shapeless. Like smoke.
