~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=His speech glides, perfect and strange.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=Skimming steps whisper him nearer.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_warrior=<warrior.coward/goofball/hothead/healer/poet/60:[face:grim]Thrixl? We have to assume so./[face:grim]Thrixl? Not sure. But it's \nnot my Uncle Wilbur./Thrixl? Yeah. But even if it's not.../Thrixl? Can't easily tell, but.../Thrixl wear many disguises./Thrixl? It's only likely.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_mystic=Is that one of them? The...
~01~prompt~panel_002~4_bookish=[small]This one's wearing [i]pants[].
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_speech=[white][i]I[] am not one of anyone, and certainly no one so unpleasant. I am called the Mothman, wheresoever I am called. I am the only one there is.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_narration=His articulations are uncomfortable on the eye.
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_narration=Spider-precise.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_mystic=[gray]He seems alright...
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_warrior=[i]Seeming[] is a weapon they'll wield like a sword.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_speech=[white]Simply look at me. Not whole human but half, and half better. I am man and more.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_speech=[white]And that is a bright warning! Pithy and true! Fortunately, as I have just finished saying...
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_speech=[white][i]I[] am no Thrixl. Now forestall your misplaced animosity and listen.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_speech=[white]I found you three ensorcelled, wandering deep in the woods, removed from any reasonable roam.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_speech=[white]Where unreason reigns, Thrixl hide their aims!
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_speech=[white]And that is one of mine, \nbut you can use it.
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_speech=[white]For one with my abilities, gathering you and waving away your enchantments was a trifle. A matter of politeness. And yet, the ones who cast these webs... they are not the dull drones they appear to be. They are imaginative.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_speech=[white]They expended thought on removing you. They must have deemed three flimsy birds dangerous to their designs.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_speech=[white]So I am struck with wondering... why would they think that? \nYou must admit, it is a curious thing.
~01~prompt~panel_013~3_mystic=<mystic.bookish/coward/hothead/loner/poet/60:Compelling, I guess? We lack a frame\nof reference. But you.../Yep. But curiosity's fine. We can \ngo home now, right?/[face:talking]Maybe because we already \n[i]killed[] a bunch of them?/[face:grim]None of this makes... well.\nWhat do [i]I[] know?/[face:skeptical]<bookish> and me? [i]Dangerous[]? Only to books, wine, and wedding-spreads./We did kill some of those... the spider-legged, \ndouble-headed dragon things? Glowbellies.>

~01~prompt~panel_014~1_bookish=<bookish.personality:[face:skeptical]Why have [i]I[] never read of Thrixl? Accounts, records, even [i]stories[].../[face:interested]Uh, but... is there anything to do about it?/[face:happy]Also curious about... As a Mothman, do you find fire hard to resist?/[face:interested]Think they've got something they want to keep us from getting?/[face:interested]Hope you'll excuse some gentle questioning. First, uh.../[face:skeptical]You've said a lot of stuff. We're just supposed to accept it?/[face:grim]Taken at your word, we're in your debt. [i]My[] question is.../[face:grim]It's stupid. Interfering with them wasn't [i]our[] goal. Mine [i]or[] my <mystic.mf:brother/sister/sibling>'s./[face:interested]Mysteries are all we seem to be left with./[face:interested]Maybe we're more important than anyone thought. I kind of always.../[face:skeptical]This's a lot. All this you're saying. The fact [i]you're[]... you [i]are[].>

~01~prompt~panel_015~1_warrior=It'll be dark, soon.
~01~prompt~panel_016~3_narration=The Mothman follows <warrior>'s eyes. He lifts his glance to the shadowy leaves...
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_warrior=And that's when <warrior> leaps!
~01~prompt~panel_019~3_narration=The Mothman doesn't seem to hurry.
~01~prompt~panel_019~4_narration=But <warrior> tackles air.
~01~prompt~panel_019~5_action=[darkGray]Whhf...
~01~prompt~panel_020~4_warrior=Tell me where <npc.mf:Master/Madam/Master> <npc.lastname> is. \n[i]Tell me[], you cursed thing.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_speech=[white]Ah, dear nestling. Follow your own wings back, if you are brave. \nSee what is heaping under their shroud. But be warned: \nyou may once more wish your sight sweetly veiled.
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_narration=He turns to leave.
~01~prompt~panel_023~2_bookish=Hey! Hey, Mothman! Why <bookish.loner.60:would anyone/should we> believe you?
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_speech=[white]You are lost in the woods, my dear. \nWhom you believe makes no difference.
~01~prompt~panel_024~2_action=[actionSmall]flit.
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_speech=[white]Oh, and...
~01~prompt~panel_025~2_narration=Borrowed shadows flush and drip \nfrom trees to cohere around him.
~01~prompt~panel_026~2_narration=The forest bleeds to black.
~01~prompt~panel_027~3_speech=[white]I [i]do[] suggest little birds flock together. You would never guess how many owls there are in a night.
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_narration=Sudden as the darkness clotted, the last light smears it away.
~01~prompt~panel_028~2_narration=They stand where a Mothman might never have been.
~01~prompt~panel_029~2_narration=The trees crowd thicker.
~01~prompt~panel_029~4_bookish=Which way did we even come from? How far did we walk, without knowing? I'm not really hungry. Did we eat? Sleep?
~01~prompt~panel_030~3_mystic=<mystic.ecthisSparkRivalry/ecthisSparkFriendship/ecthisSparkRomance:[face:skeptical]Hey, /[face:talking]Um, /[face:interested]I'm sorry, /><warrior>, that name... <npc.fullname>, right? You shouted it \nwhen we were in the ruin. <mystic.ecthisSparkRivalry/ecthisSparkFriendship/ecthisSparkRomance:Your what? Your teacher?/Can I ask who they are?/Someone special to you?/>
~01~prompt~panel_031~3_mystic=<mystic.ecthisSparkRivalry/ecthisSparkFriendship/ecthisSparkRomance:[face:grim]We're here because of you./[face:neutral]But if you need time, or--/[face:grim]You don't have to talk about it, if it's--/[face:neutral]But if you need time, or-->
~01~prompt~panel_032~1_mystic=<mystic.ecthisSparkRivalry/ecthisSparkFriendship/ecthisSparkRomance:[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/>Hide?
~01~prompt~panel_032~2_mystic=They begin to walk.
~01~prompt~panel_033~1_warrior=<mystic.ecthisSparkRivalry/ecthisSparkFriendship/ecthisSparkRomance://It's okay./>  <npc.fullname> is who taught me the <warrior.weaponType:sword./axe./hammer and star./spear./bow./crossbow./dirk./staff./wand./warrior's way.> Among other things. <npc.mf:He/She/They> made me hide.
~01~prompt~panel_033~2_narration=<warrior> whips around.
~01~prompt~panel_034~1_warrior=From the Thrixl. Came and they took <npc.mf:him/her/everyone>. Took everyone but me. <warrior.bookish/coward/goofball/snark/60:None of us [i]knew[] enough. Knew anything. Knowledge is the first step. Come on./[face:interested]I was afraid. All my training, and I... Anyway. Let's go?/[face:interested]Strange, right? That's where [i]my[] journey began. But let's go./I know the likely thing is <npc.mf:he's/she's/they're> dead. I'm not an idiot. Come on./Come on. I see the wood's edge.> Think we ought to head <warrior.directionTo.site:north/north and east/east/south and east/south/south and west/west/north and west/here>.
~01~prompt~panel_036~2_bookish=<mystic.personality:It's like visiting a novel. It's like being characters \nfrom a story. It's... <bookish.personality:nothing [i]I've[] read. But still.../a horror-story, yeah. Hopefully we finish it soon./not as fun as it sounds. But maybe the next scene's funnier?/maybe it'll be worth it. In the end?/not a pleasant book. Sorry./a rough start. But we'll finish it our way./our reality. For now./something new, anyway./illuminating. Frightening./maybe it's who we are now./bad. Huh. Sucks to be in a bad book.>/A story. I think we've \nlanded in a story./Bleck. I guess. Definitely looked different./Thrixls. Yeah. But still got to make it home./"Every star feels alone in the dark. Only from a distance can \nwe see... how each gleams in the company of millions."/I'm at least [i]one[] of those./Was wondering when you'd start that talk. \nYeah. You're right though. You're right./Was noticing that. We might be [i]much[]\nfurther from home than we thought./Feels optimistic, suddenly. To think \nwe're the ones in charge of this tale./<mystic.awm:<bookish.romantic.60:That's literally the last thing I would've thought of. But I guess it's a... I mean, it's a question. It's certainly a question./What a romantic notion. If he did change, once... \nwhat, or [i]whom[]... did he leave behind?>/If you're going to fall in love with <bookish.romantic.60:him, let's agree you tell me everything./<mystic.ecthisSparkRivalry/ecthisSparkFriendship/ecthisSparkRomance:him, \ndo it privately. Creeps me out./him, \ndo it privately. Creeps me out./[i]him[] too, \nI'll seriously disown you and leave you in this forest./==>>>/Not sure. But look at some of these trees. \nWeird breeds. I've never seen them [i]anywhere[].>
~01~prompt~panel_036~3_mystic=<mystic.personality:Everything's just... just been [i]altered[]. As we... We're standing \nat the center of a puzzlebox, as some child twists it round./Just what [i]is[] this? All of this?/[face:happy]Hey. You think that guy really meant he was a [i]Moth[]man?\nDon't know why, but I kind of enjoyed his flair./[face:talking]Shouldn't we consider...? I mean, can't we decide \nwhether we really [i]want[] to meet more Thrixes?/Hey, <bookish>. Just remember, we've gotten through a lot. \nMom would've told us her star thing./[face:skeptical]Lot of feelings, right? I'm angry, I'm kind of anxious. Actually, \nI'm mostly just [i]excited[]. Well, and I'm kind of cold./[face:talking]Life's not supposed to just happen to you. It's not a story. \nWe have to take back control./[face:grim]Hm. I don't recognize some of these leaves. Bird calls./"[face:neutral]These stories of mine are transcribed moonlight.\nBut they were invented by my feet."/Do you think that Mothman [i]was[] a man, once? Do you think that, \nunder that hat, the affectations... he's a [i]longing being[]...? Like us?/[face:sad]My head's a bag of nails. All my muscles feel like \nthere's teeth in them. How far do we have to go?>
