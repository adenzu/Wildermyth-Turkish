~01~~panel_002~2_hunter=<hunter.exists:Got a cold campfire. Built, but <hunter.coward.60:I don't think it ever/it never> burned./>
~01~~panel_003~2_hunter=<hunter.exists:Any insight?/>
~01~~panel_003~3_ship=<hook.rfln.ship:[face:dubious]Seems like <hook.mf:him/her/them>. <hunter.exists:Look,/In typical fashion,> <hook.mf:he/she/they> left \nwalnut shells just [i]everywhere[]./Seems like a place <hook>'d choose. There's that creek we passed, there's this climbable pine.../[face:interested]Looks like <hook>'s work. But my eyes might just be longing for <hook.mf:him/her/them> at this point./It's a fine fire.

~01~~panel_005~3_ship=<hunter.exists:/But... Even if <hook.mf:he/she/they> had to leave suddenly, wouldn't <hook.mf:he/she/they> have scattered it? Maybe not, I guess? <ship.rfln.hook:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/Ah love. Be alright.[face:sad]/>>
~01~~panel_006~2_ship=<hunter.exists:/<ship> goes to make <ship.mf:his/her/their> report, perhaps more worried now than <ship.mf:he was/she was/they were> before.>

~01~~panel_009~1_npc=Come on, <hook>. This place's dangerous for us both.
