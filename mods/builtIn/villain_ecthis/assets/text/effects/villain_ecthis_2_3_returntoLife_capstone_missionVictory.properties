~01~~panel_001~4_mystic=[gray]We came as quick as we could. <mystic.bookish/coward/healer/leader/romantic/60:With our limited knowledge./[face:sad]But I can't look at them./Now they need fresh water and free breeze. Medicine./First thing now's just getting out./[face:sad]Wish we'd been [i]quicker[]./Can't help but feel sorry, though.>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Familiar faces float from the shadows where they hid. They're changed. Grimy, hollow-eyed. They stare.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=But they are <town> folk. \nAnd they are alive.

Can you walk, or do you need assistance?/[face:interested]There more Thrixl coming? Could be, right? Let's hurry, everyone. Sorry, please?/[face:sad]You poor kids didn't deserve this. Anyone who wants, I'll help you up./[face:grim]Won't ask for gratitude, now. Just need you all to start moving. Let's get to clean air./Imagine it's hard to even stand, even move. But we'll help. Not far to open air./[face:grim]Wish we could kill those monsters twice. Come on, you lot. Can help whoever can't climb./[face:grim]The monsters are dead. Come with us. Anyone need to be carried? Little ones?/[face:grim]A nightmare. Penned together like animals. You all can climb? Follow me./[face:grim]Can you walk? We killed those monsters. Take courage and climb out with us, to the sun./[face:grim]Let's go, friends. You're free. Forget this pit and climb to the sun with me./[face:grim]You all can climb? Don't imagine you're anxious to stay.>/>

~01~~panel_006~1_narration=Searching out human faces, <bookish.exists:they find/<mystic> finds> just [blue]<int:max(25, min(55, company.townsfolkRemaining))>[] of the lost. But they're survivors. They clamber from the nests of rotting vegetation that've presumably been provided for them.
~01~~panel_006~2_npc2=<mystic.villainEcthis_fromHometown:Ah... <mystic>...? You're...?/>
~01~~panel_007~1_bookish=<bookish.exists:<company.ecthis_2_2_split:Here you are. Found some more?[face:interested]/[gray]Some of them, we couldn't get to. Those warped things... went berserk.>/>
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=<bookish.exists:/<company.ecthis_2_2_split:Attacking from two sides, they were able to save some from the lashing madness of their twisted former kin./Some fell in the battle, victims of mindless violence at the hands of their twisted former kin.>>

~01~~panel_009~1_narration=It'll take days of warm coaxing to crack the cold trauma that's frozen their faces grim.

~01~~panel_011~1_speech=I'm just worried about my big sister. She... I think... that she died.
~01~~panel_012~1_mystic=<mystic.villainEcthis_fromHometown:Your sister's Eluna, right?<mystic.villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero: She and I had classes together, sometimes./>/I'm sorry. What was your sister's name?>
~01~~panel_013~1_speech=<mystic.villainEcthis_fromHometown:Mhmm, that's her. They took her away like the others. But she never..../Eluna. I'm Elsee. They, she, they took her away like the others. But she never... >
~01~~panel_014~1_mystic=Took her up the tunnel?
~01~~panel_015~1_speech=No, it... there was a, it was like a door made out of spiderstring. It was like a... they wove it, kind of. In the air, it appeared, and it went somewhere else, I don't know. But they took people through. One by one, they. Everyone seemed to [i]want[] to go.
~01~~panel_016~1_mystic=<bookish.exists:[face:skeptical]Think that's what it must've been./[face:grim]Think it was something called a [i]Glimrseen[].>
~01~~panel_016~2_bookish=<bookish.exists:[face:interested]Sounds like the [i]Glimrseen[]. Like what the Mothman said?/>
~01~~panel_016~3_speech=They called it [i]The Door[]. \nEluna and the older kids.
~01~~panel_017~1_speech=[light]People'd go through. And they'd come back, once time had passed. \nAnd except... they'd look like monsters, then. And they wouldn't talk.
~01~~panel_018~1_mystic=<mystic.bookish/goofball/healer/hothead/snark/60:Any glimpse I've gotten into their minds, they seem hollow. Cavernous. Full of nothing./[face:interested]What'd you expect them to say?/The changes appear to wholly wipe away... whoever they used to be. I'm sorry./[face:angry]No one should go through that. Certainly no one your age should [i]see[] it./No, they don't really seem like talkers./Doesn't seem to be much left. Not on the outside, not on the inside. Just a violent misery.>
~01~~panel_019~1_speech=Um, but Eluna was the last one taken. She's been gone a lot longer than the others, and never came back.
~01~~panel_020~1_speech=So, anyway. I'm pretty sure she died. I mean I hope she didn't. But then I also think... it might be better if she did. Because she wouldn't want...
~01~~panel_020~2_mystic=Shh, I understand. <mystic.coward/hothead/loner/romantic/snark/60:Sometimes not hoping feels safest./[face:angry]But you know, we've avenged her. We'll [i]keep[] avenging her, as long as they keep coming./[face:neutral]<mystic.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero/villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:My mom didn't suffer long. I'm glad for that much./My mom didn't suffer long. I'm glad for that much./Don't want her to suffer.>/Still, there's no reason not to hope. That she was different. That she survived, somehow.[face:talking]/[face:neutral]It's smart. Expecting too much will only bring you more suffering./It's alright. We'll go back and look again. Once you're safe.>
~01~~panel_021~1_speech=Mm, yeah. <mystic.coward/hothead/loner/romantic/snark/60:I guess./Okay.//Alright.[mystic.face:neutral]/I guess./Alright. >
~01~~panel_022~1_speech=It smells so good all the sudden. Doesn't it?
~01~~panel_022~2_narration=They reach the edge of the woodmarsh. The musical yips of a wild fox \ngreet them, echoing in the wind. Milkgold sunshine coats the world.
~01~~panel_023~1_speech=I should also, I mean she'd ask me to say. [i]Thank you[].
~01~~panel_024~1_speech=We tried to escape, me and Eluna. We did try. But. They caught us. Thank you for coming to get me. You proved my sister right.
~01~~panel_025~2_narration=They trek towards home.
~01~~panel_026~1_narration=Later searches only stir the bones.
~01~~panel_026~2_narration=No sign of the girl's sister appears.
~01~~panel_026~3_narration=If something called a Glimrseen exists here, \nit seems beyond human access.
