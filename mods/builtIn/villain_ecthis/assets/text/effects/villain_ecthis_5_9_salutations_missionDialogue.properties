~01~prompt~panel_002~1_speech=[white]Not running?
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_speech=[light]Are you really going to give me a fight?
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_speech=[white]A [i]duel,[] we would have called it. When I was young and dumb and rash.
~01~prompt~panel_004~4_speech=[white]That is to say, when I was a little more like you.
~01~prompt~panel_004~5_speech=[white]Words won't harm me. And they \ncertainly won't save your life.
~01~prompt~panel_005~4_speech=[white]No, indeed! Please understand, they only help me take my beatings a little more bravely.
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_speech=[white]Yes. You did. You are very intrepid. \nAnd what do you think now?
~01~prompt~panel_006~5_speech=[white]I came such a long way, devoted so much time, bent so many Thrixl forms to hunting you...

~01~prompt~panel_010~1_speech=[white]I am sorry.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_speech=[white]An old man can still pay the debts of his careless youth.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_speech=[white]Fool. If you're able to show me something [i]new[]... I welcome it.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_speech=[white]Perhaps not. But I saved the last dance for you, my Queen.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_speech=[white]And you think [i]sorry[] makes up for anything?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~2_narration=[white]She's far more powerful.\n     He's far more practiced.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~3_narration=[white]In the end... it only \n      matters who's quicker.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_narration=[white]She's far more powerful.\n     He's far more practiced.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~3_narration=[white]In the end... it only \n      matters who's quicker.
