Because of who your sister is? <hook.bookish/greedy/healer/leader/poet/60:[face:interested]That'd be an unexpected dynamic... but I doubt it's the case. He was clearly [i]pursued[]./[face:interested]Oh, interesting. Maybe you've got some heft in this world you're not aware of?/No knowing, I suppose. I wouldn't worry if I was you./I'd say the likeliest reason is that gang we just got rid of. [i]Hunters[], they seemed like./[face:interested]No knowing, I suppose. Why a moth takes flight./No, girl, I'm pretty sure it was the gigantic netherworm that chased him off.[face:skeptical]>/<hook.bookish/goofball/greedy/60:[face:interested]An expeditious, if somewhat [i]dramatic[] form of retreat. Strange, and fortunate./<hook.villainEcthis_dream:[face:interested]Wonder if [i]I[] can learn that.

For a fruitless trip around the country.>>>>/<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]<deadHero.2.exists:Burials will have to wait./Sorry, <deadHero.1>. I will bury you with honor. \nBut first... why we came here. Right?>/[face:neutral]Getting pretty handy on my own, aren't I?>>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The columns go quiet.\nCombat's done.
~01~~panel_002~2_hunter=<hunter.exists:<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]If this's what it'll cost to catch up to that Mothman, maybe it's not worth it./<hunter.ecthis_Elsee:[face:interested]Do you think the Mothman ran away from [i]me[]? I've never met him, but maybe my...?/<hunter.villainEcthis_seenMothman:<hunter.bookish/goofball/healer/leader/60:Mothman sure is a knot of riddles, to me./[face:interested]Crazy trick that Mothman pulled, huh? Have to be impressed./[face:interested]Mothman looked pretty messed up. Didn't even notice us, did he? Least he got away./[face:interested]Mothman looked pretty messed up. Didn't even notice us, did he? Least he got away./Mothman never makes anything easy. Can't tell if that's his nature or his choice.>/Now [i]I've[] finally seen him. The Mothman. Didn't look to be in good condition.>>>/>
~01~~panel_003~1_hunter=<healer.exists:/<hunter.exists:Looks like a campsite over here. Find out more./>>
~01~~panel_003~2_narration=<hunter.exists:/<hook> soon discovers what looks like a humble campsite.>
~01~~panel_003~3_healer=<healer.exists:<healer.bookish/loner/poet/snark/60:[face:skeptical]This'll pique your interest./Hey, look at this./This'll pique your interest./[face:skeptical]Surprisingly human arrangement he had here./[face:talking]Hey guys, over here.> Kind of a campsite./>
~01~~panel_004~1_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:There's bandages stuffed in the rocks. Look used. I guess he bleeds red?/>
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=<volunteer.exists:/Used bandages are wadded under rocks. Ash of a small campfire is dashed over the hard gravelly earth. >
~01~~panel_004~3_volunteer2=<volunteer2.exists:Remains of a little fire. Some mud where water was poured./>
~01~~panel_005~1_healer=<healer.exists:This old settlement would be easy to hide in. <healer.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/leader/loner/60:[face:interested]I understand why he ran, too. Just bad timing./[face:talking]Sit back behind the rubble and chuck rocks. But.../[face:skeptical]Sort of. Or maybe he was here to find something?/[face:grim]Less of a coward and we'd have saved him here./[face:grim]Good vantage in spots. Avenues to slip down. But.../[face:skeptical]Wouldn't mind hunkering here for a quiet spell./Wonder whose home it used to be...>/>
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=<hunter.exists:/It's obvious from the proud sprawl of this dead settlement: \nit was an important place, once. To someone.>
~01~~panel_005~3_hunter=<hunter.exists:<healer.exists:[small]<hunter.ecthis_Elsee:[face:interested]But he's putting a big beacon over his head, right?

Just my opinion.>/<hunter.ecthis_Elsee:[face:interested]This investigation stuff's not really what I was prepared for./<hunter.krfln.hook:Remember when we'd go hide around the quarry? Reminds me of that./Hate to ask, but... do [i]you[] know what his plan is? Makes no sense to me./Is he trying to hide... or? But then he's putting up that big beacon, so.../What do you think, love? Am I stupid thinking he shouldn't have run?/Is he trying to hide... or? But then he's putting up that big beacon, so...>>>/>
~01~~panel_006~1_hook=<hunter.exists:<hook.ecthis_Elsee:[face:interested]Well how about that? Isn't that his [i]mark[]?/Surviving fireplace. Actually, here's his [i]sigil[].>/>

~01~~panel_007~1_narration=The mark looks weathered, as if it was etched into the stonework long ago.
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=However, the pit of the fireplace has been dug up recently, filled again with haste.
~01~~panel_008~1_hook=<hunter.exists:Left something for us...?/>
~01~~panel_008~2_hook=<hunter.exists:/[face:grim]Guess I was meant to find this?>
~01~~panel_008~3_hunter=<hunter.exists:[face:skeptical]Pass me that shovel./>
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=A moment's digging surfaces a small box from the shallow hole where it was pressed. It opens at a touch, and inside...
~01~~panel_009~2_hook=It's a map.
~01~~panel_011~1_hook=<hunter.exists:<hook.ecthis_Elsee:[face:interested]Smart of him. Thrixl probably wouldn't think of digging it up./Must've realized he couldn't keep drawing all that attention.>/>
~01~~panel_011~2_hook=<hunter.exists:/Realized you couldn't keep drawing all that attention, huh? Good luck. I'll be as fast as I can.[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_011~3_hunter=<hunter.exists:<hunter.ecthis_Elsee:Smart of him, huh?[face:interested] Doubt Thrixl would've thought to dig. I mean, it's so ordinary./<hook.ecthis_Elsee:[face:skeptical]Mm, maybe. Let's just be glad we found it first./Let's hope he made it where he meant to go. And just... stay ready for tricks.>>/>
~01~~panel_012~1_hook=<hunter.exists:<hook.ecthis_Elsee:[face:neutral]Still hard to believe I'm out here. Doing this. <deadHero.exists:[face:grim]And already burying friends./But I'll never [face:grim]be helpless again.>/<hunter.ecthis_Elsee:[face:grim]Hard to say. But I'm glad we found it first. Hope he made it where he wanted to go./[face:neutral]Ready and ready and ready. Every day. What a sad word that is. [i]Ready[].>>/[face:grim]Don't make me a fool.>
