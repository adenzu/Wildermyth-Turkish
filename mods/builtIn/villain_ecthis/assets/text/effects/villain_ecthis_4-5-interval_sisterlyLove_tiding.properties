~01~~panel_001~1_narration=A young woman without a family returned to the last place she could claim that wasn't true. She came alone.
~01~~panel_001~2_child=<child.coward/healer/hothead/loner/poet/romantic/60:[face:interested]Can't believe you're doing this. Can't believe you're doing this [i]yourself[]. You sure about this, Elsee? Are you double-sure?/You have this in you, Elsee-girl. You're the only one who remembers her the right way./Stronger than they all think. Strong enough to make your own way in the world. Your own choices./Better this way. No one can face a nightmare but the one who dreamed it./Had to be like this. No one can face a nightmare but the one who dreamed it./You have this in you, Elsee. You're the only one who remembers her the right way./You can do this, Elsee-girl. You can do it. \nNo one needs to hold your hand anymore.>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The marsh was almost unfamiliar. A din of frogs and birds and insects rang wild and unstifled.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=The dark pit didn't steam or spill wretched vapor. \nLike a cold skull, it gaped to see her again.
~01~~panel_003~2_child=<child.bookish/goofball/healer/poet/snark/60:Perspective changes everything.\nNarrower than I recall./Hole must've [i]shrunk[]./Narrow fit. They \nmust've been brave./That's a slender fit./[face:skeptical]Still disgusting./Narrower than I remember.>
~01~~panel_004~2_child=You can do this. You can. You've gone here in your head a hundred times. You can do this.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=Between the wet pressing walls she squeezed, mudsmeared and ducking the lapping tongue of her torch.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=At the tunnel's foot, she found...
~01~~panel_006~1_child=Nothing.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=The abandoned air seemed as if it hadn't passed\nliving lips in years and stale years.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=The earthsmell was cool, dank, and dull.
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=Nothing like the hot cruel stench that crawled in her memory.
~01~~panel_009~2_child=For some reason, I was expecting you to be here.
~01~~panel_009~3_narration=Elsee put up her stolen sword.
~01~~panel_010~3_child=Don't know why. Why would you come here now? If you're really what they say you are. So powerful.
~01~~panel_011~3_child=Here where we huddled... watching death select our friends. Their bodies, their minds disfigured beyond knowing. Where we lived with the promise and example... of our own hideous doom.
~01~~panel_011~4_action=[gray][actionSmall]chitter...
~01~~panel_011~5_action=[darkGray][actionSmall]squirch...
~01~~panel_012~4_child=Eluna?
~01~~panel_014~2_npc=We'll make it through, Elsee-girl. You're going to survive this. It'll all be a rotten memory someday. You'll put it on a dark shelf and never look at it. But here. You have to eat. Or that day won't come.
~01~~panel_015~3_child=Thought you'd be here, Eluna. Or... they tell me you call yourself Ecthis, now. That's fine. We're family, still. Whoever you are now... I still...
~01~~panel_016~3_child=Still...
~01~~panel_017~2_npc=You won [i]again[]? How're you so good at this game?\nThought my northgoing road would confuse you.
~01~~panel_017~3_speech=I'm not an idiot! I own the corners, remember?
~01~~panel_018~3_child=I still remember. How hard you tried to trick me... into thinking we'd survive.
~01~~panel_019~4_child=I remember, Eluna. Ecthis. And I still love you, no matter who you are. Look, I actually [i]made it.[] All you did for me... it mattered. But so now... why don't you take me? Take me to your side. I'll go. Help you. Whatever you want, I'll [i]help[] you. Even against... just. Please.
~01~~panel_020~1_narration=She heard no answer but the low pondering pulses of the marsh, the wash and drip and watery murmur.
~01~~panel_021~4_child=If you don't take me... I'll forget you. I'll throw down this stupid sword, this, and I'll... I [i]will[] forget you. Unless you come out. Let me see you again. You can even kill me, I don't even care!
~01~~panel_022~5_action=[blue]drip.\n\n\n\n\n        [purple]drop.
~01~~panel_024~1_child=[large]Please!!!
~01~~panel_025~1_child=Please...!
~01~~panel_026~1_child=[small]You don't even have to be my sister anymore. You can \nbe Queen of everything. Just... let me... see you. Again.
~01~~panel_030~1_narration=Elsee Arcwright traveled far from that day.
~01~~panel_030~2_narration=She went not trusting that she'd never return. But she never did.\nShe wound up building a home somewhere, finding a dream to foster.
~01~~panel_030~3_narration=She'd remember Eluna. Of course she would.\nBut her valiant kind sister... had died.
~01~~panel_031~1_narration=Eluna Arcwright was dead. Of that much, Elsee needed to be certain.
