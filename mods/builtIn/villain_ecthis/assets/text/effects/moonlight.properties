.name=Chapter Kickoff
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=Never trust a dream you dream in moonlight.
~01~~panel_001~3_narration=There's wisdom that survives from grandmother times:
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Take care if you lie under \nthe window's cast.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Even gaps as slender as moonbeams
~01~~panel_003~2_narration=will admit a skilled weaver's needle.
~01~~panel_004~1_hook=[gray]It's black here.
~01~~panel_005~1_hook=[gray]In the dark between\nbook and shelf.
~01~~panel_006~1_hook=[gray]But oh.
~01~~panel_007~1_hook=[gray]Trillium moon.
~01~~panel_008~1_hook=[gray]You don't seem real.
~01~~panel_009~1_action=Pow!
~01~~panel_009~2_action=Flitch!
~01~~panel_010~1_hook=[gray]Ease up. I'm only saying so.
~01~~panel_011~1_hook=[gray]Bet I'm out on the ocean, behind the bookcase.
~01~~panel_012~1_hook=[gray]<hook.personality:<mystic.exists:<hook.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero/villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<mystic>/<mystic>/<ship>>/<ship>>'s probably getting impatient, but I can't ignore this opportunity. To survey the legendsea. Hm. Now where's my pen? Can never find my pen when I need it. Can I fish for one?/[face:interested]<mystic.exists:<hook.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero/villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<mystic>/<mystic>/<ship>>/<ship>>'s going to want to take a boat out. Then we'll all fall in and drown somehow, and no one'll be the least bit embarrassed about it. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?/<ship> won't believe I found it. [face:happy]Wonder if <ship.mf:he/she/they>'d be mad if I woke <ship.mf:him/her/them>. Depends what kind of dream <ship.mf:he's/she's/they're> having, I guess./Everybody'll want to come and take my fish. Guess I'll need to impose some kind of limit. A weight limit? A two-books grouper is fine. A dictionary squid. Anything heavier, you owe me things./<mystic.exists:<hook.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero/villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<mystic>/<mystic>/<ship>>/<ship>> might drown if it's not tidy. I should make sure the books are sorted. And I'll have to dust. Double-dust, to be safe./<mystic.exists:<hook.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero/villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<mystic>/<mystic>/<ship>>/<ship>>'s going to expect me to wait for <mystic.exists:<hook.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero/villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<mystic.mf:him/her/them>/<mystic.mf:him/her/them>/<ship.mf:him/her/them>>/<ship.mf:him/her/them>>. But come on, we do too much waiting already. Too much pulling on our wrists and sitting on our hocks./Everything'd be at risk if I leave shore. <mystic.exists:<hook.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero/villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<mystic>'d be left alone./<mystic>'d be left alone./<ship>'d wonder why I didn't say anything.>/<ship>'d wonder why I didn't say anything.> But I'll have to cross the sea someday, won't I? Isn't that why it's there?/[face:neutral]Hm. Listen to it. The paperblowing wind, all quiet. Wouldn't be bad to get lost back here. Like a pen, or a coin, or a key./<mystic.exists:<hook.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero/villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<mystic>/<mystic>/<ship>>/<ship>>'s going to want to stay dry. But if I slip into that water, will[face:interested] I wash to the depths? Will I grow paper fins and swim eternity's legends alone?/<mystic.exists:<hook.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero/villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<mystic>/<mystic>/<ship>>/<ship>> will walk the shore with me, reading every spine. If only I can find the entrance to <mystic.exists:<hook.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero/villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<mystic.mf:his/her/their>/<mystic.mf:his/her/their>/<ship.mf:his/her/their>>/<ship.mf:his/her/their>> sleep. If only a star or a serpent would guide me./[face:dubious]Someone needs to chase the ocean away. Clawing and scrabbling up the shore, and if it's in the walls, these days, how will any of us stay dry?>
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=There's someone out jumping on the waves!
~01~~panel_014~1_hook=[gray]Oh, hey! There's...!
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=The figure falls through a hole in the shifting waters.
~01~~panel_016~1_hook=[gray]Watch out, that's dange--!
~01~~panel_017~1_hook=[gray]...that's dangerous. I tried to say.
~01~~panel_018~1_hook=[gray]Am I the only one who can do something?
~01~~panel_019~1_narration=The sheep certainly won't help. \n<hook.personality2:<hook.mf:He's/She's/It's> strictly a ruminating animal./That flinching beast./Feckless animal./Selfish creature./Faint-hearted beast./Ignoble creature./<hook.mf:He's/She's/It's> got responsibilities./Austere animal./Vaguely-there creature./<hook.mf:He's/She's/It's> a fickle beast./<hook.mf:He's/She's/It's> a lazy beast.>
~01~~panel_020~1_narration=So <hook> hops over \nthe woolymisted sea.
~01~~panel_022~1_narration=<hook.mf:Drips/Drips/Drips> \n  limb \n    by limb \n       into  \ndarkness.
~01~~panel_023~1_narration=And now <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> inside a shadowy cell, where \nodorless lamps emit little more than haze.
~01~~panel_024~2_npc=Who... who're you?
~01~~panel_025~1_hook=I'm who's having the dream.
~01~~panel_025~2_npc=<hook.villainEcthis_fromHometown:Is that... <hook>? \n<hook.fullname>?/You're what? \nYou're talking.>
~01~~panel_026~1_hook=<hook.villainEcthis_fromHometown:Eluna Arcwright? How vivid this seems. \nIt's like I'm seeing you again./You're the missing sister. \nYou're Eluna Arcwright.>
~01~~panel_026~2_npc=<hook.villainEcthis_fromHometown:You [i]are[]./That's... me. But.>
~01~~panel_026~3_narration=<hook.villainEcthis_fromHometown:<hook> suddenly recognizes this young woman.../Unearned knowledge enters <hook>'s head.>
~01~~panel_027~1_hook=Well. You're in my dream.
~01~~panel_028~2_npc=How'd you get here? Do [i]they[] know?
~01~~panel_029~1_hook=<hook.villainEcthis_fromHometown:Elsee?/The little one?> We found her. She's safe.
~01~~panel_029~2_npc=Dream. You keep saying you're dreaming. If you're not one of their tricks, if you're really <hook.villainEcthis_fromHometown:<hook.fullname>.../from the outside...> Maybe you got here through dreaming? Do you know what happened to my little sister?
~01~~panel_030~1_hook=<hook.goofball/hothead/healer/loner/snark/60:[face:happy]If any of us are./[face:grim]Not many were as \nlucky as her./[face:happy]And worried for you./[face:neutral]Right. Basically./[face:skeptical]Safe as anyone./Endured a lot, but she's okay.>
~01~~panel_031~2_npc=She's safe?
~01~~panel_032~1_hook=This feels too real. Where're we meant to be?
~01~~panel_032~2_npc=Somewhere else. Those bug-things brought me through the... Their world and ours, there's... this won't make sense, but it's like a...
~01~~panel_033~1_narration=The noise vibrates in every unfirm stone.
~01~~panel_033~2_hook=Trouble?
~01~~panel_033~4_action=[actionSmall][blue]...thrm...
~01~~panel_034~1_narration=From beyond a dim door, a drone enters the room. Distant light grows.
~01~~panel_035~1_hook=How do we save you? We'll come and get you out.
~01~~panel_035~2_npc=<hook.villainEcthis_fromHometown:<hook>/Whoever you are>, if you can leave here, you need to do it. \nThey're going to find you, and I don't know if...
~01~~panel_035~3_action=[actionSmall][blue]...gzzmm...
~01~~panel_036~2_hook=Actually, I... what we need is to find another one of those Glimrseens. Right?
~01~~panel_037~2_action=[purple]...rrzzz...
~01~~panel_037~3_action=[darkBlue]...rrzzz...
~01~~panel_037~4_npc=They'll sense a threat, and you won't ever get close. My sister's strong. Tell her I--
~01~~panel_038~2_hook=Can you be sure they'd detect us?
~01~~panel_038~3_npc=Well... I... The longer I've been here, the more it's seemed they have some other perception...
~01~~panel_039~1_action=[blue]...dzzz...
~01~~panel_039~2_action=[purple]...dzzz...
~01~~panel_039~4_npc=A sense attuned to the forces inside things. Their essences, or... whatever you call it. A group of you would be like thunder to them.
~01~~panel_040~1_action=[blue]...vvvd...
~01~~panel_040~2_action=[purple]...vvvd...
~01~~panel_040~4_npc=You'd be throwing your lives away. For a person who's been gone so long, she... I... can barely remember Elsee's face...
~01~~panel_041~2_hook=I'll come alone, then.
~01~~panel_043~1_narration=The dream begins to fade.
~01~~panel_044~1_narration=<hook> wakes from <hook.mf:his/her/their> wandering sleep.
~01~~panel_044~2_narration=<hook.mf:He holds/She holds/They hold> a clear idea in <hook.mf:his/her/their> mind, like a kernel of light that can draw <hook.mf:him/her/them> over the hills to where <hook.mf:he/she/they> must go.
~01~~panel_045~1_narration=Several days pass before <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> missed.
~01~~panel_046~1_hunter=<hook.mf:His/Her/Their> trail's easy enough to follow...
~01~~panel_047~1_ship=<hook.mf:His/Her/Their> note wasn't. Chasing a dream? Of a girl who's been missing for how long? <ship.rfln.hook:<hook.personality:Isn't <hook.mf:he/she/they> supposed to be smart?/Sounds too heroic for old <hook>.../I'm sure it's some sick joke, but still.../I'm sure <hook.mf:he sees/she sees/they see> something to gain in this little stunt, but.../What, thinks <hook.mf:he/she/they> can fix [i]everything[] now...?/Impulsive idiot./Decided <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> a hero, I guess./We sure it's not a random excuse? Maybe <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> finally leaving?/<hook.mf:He's/She's/They've> always been emotional, I guess.../Though I guess it sounds like <hook.mf:him/her/them>./Never gave <hook.mf:him/her/them> credit for caring that much.>/<hook.personality:<hook.mf:He/She/They> must know something.../Something about it must've scared <hook.mf:him/her/them>.../Could be a weird joke, I suppose./Wonder what <hook.mf:his/her/their> angle might be.../Must believe <hook.mf:he/she/they> can help, somehow.../Something set <hook.mf:him/her/them> off, I guess./I don't think <hook.mf:he/she/they>'d do this on a whim.../Or maybe it's just an excuse to be alone for a while.../Something about it must've [i]moved[] <hook.mf:him/her/them>.../Eh.

Now <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> going alone?/It's not really <hook.mf:his/her/their> sense of humor, but.../I love <hook.mf:him/her/them>, but <hook.mf:he's/she's/they're> not exactly selfless./I can only imagine. Wants to set everything right, somehow./Why did I have to fall for such an impulsive <hook.mf:man/woman/person>? I guess it's part of it, though... heh./I trust <hook.mf:he/she/they> had a good reason, but even so.../Maybe <hook.mf:he/she/they> just needed time away from me.../<hook.mf:His/Her/Their> obsession with the truth inspires me. But it scares me, too./Ugh, <hook>. Pulled to a flame. Be careful./Sounds a little too romantic to be my <hook>...>/Does <hook.mf:he/she/they> do this a lot?>
~01~~panel_048~1_ship=<hook.rfln.ship:[face:interested]/[face:grim]/[face:sad]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_048~2_hunter=I don't know. But it feels a little like four years ago...
