~01~~panel_001~1_narration=The very night of the battle, <warrior> set flame to the \ntwisted body of <warrior.mf:his/her/their> one-time mentor in a fallow field.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=<warrior.mf:He/She/They> wouldn't stop working to clean the town up. \n<warrior.mf:He/She/They>'d scour hardest for signs of the lost.
~01~~panel_001~3_warrior=<warrior.personality2:Don't worry, <npc>. I was never so wishblind as to think\nyou were truly alive. In a sense... I'm glad I found you.\nI'm glad it ended here./[face:sad]Where do I find my courage, now?/[face:sad]You'll be laughing at me, I'm sure.\nWhen I see you again./If only I hadn't recognized you.\nI'd still be able to dream./[face:talking]You gave me so much. Don't think,\nfor a moment, that I'm not grateful./They [i]will[] pay, <npc.mf:Master/Madam/Master> <npc.lastname>. I promise you.\nThey'll suffer your pain a thousand times./[face:neutral]I thought you'd be with me a while longer.\nI'll take your lessons. Your name will be remembered./<npc>? Whatever you were, it's gone.\nFlames, to ash, to wind./[face:neutral]Our forms are never still. You once said that. I'm thinking \nabout that tonight. Life is forever being transmuted. \nLike now. Into ash and memory, all that was you./[face:talking]Wish you were here to make it make sense. \nMake it all seem like a bitter lesson./Galling, I'd bet. That I'd be alive, and you're dead.\nI hope you're mad. As mad I am.>
