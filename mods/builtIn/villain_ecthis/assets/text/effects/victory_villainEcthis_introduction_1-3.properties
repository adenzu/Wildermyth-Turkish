Always knew we were different, but.../Wait, we both... Did you feel...? Some piece of me. I sent it [i]out[] of me. It connected with the world, somehow. The world [i]responded[]./[face:happy]What [i]are[] we? Did you see me? I saw you!/[face:skeptical]Wait. <bookish.weaponType.wand:My [i]spoon[]'s magic? Hey, <mystic>, my spoon's magic./<mystic.weaponType.wand:Is that your [i]spoon[]? Tell me you didn't use your spoon.>> Uh, but are we okay with what just happened?>

~01~~panel_024~2_warrior=Yes. The important thing is they're capable of... how do I say it?
~01~~panel_025~1_speech=[white]Capable of captivating the mind. Grounding three birds with a glamour, sending them stumbling far to die.
~01~~panel_026~1_narration=The rakish stranger pauses to be seen.\nHow long had he been standing there?
~01~~panel_026~2_narration=He offers some kind of perfunctory salute.
~01~~panel_027~1_speech=[white]Yes, little nest-thrown dears, you might have been food for wolves and weasels. But a man happened by who bore a gift for magic, a glyphic smile...
~01~~panel_028~1_speech=[white]...and an enduring fondness for birds.
