~01~~panel_001.(Broadleaf_Forest)~1_narration=Hillpainters of the woods point <hunter> and the company up towards the high groves, where a local treasure sits tucked away among pines and great roving bears.
~01~~panel_002.(Grassland)~1_narration=Hillpainters of the fields are happy to tell about Highforest House, a remarkable place hidden up in the pines.
~01~~panel_003.(Hills)~1_narration=Hillpainters of <overlandTile> have no qualms about sharing their knowledge, and speak of an isolate treasure here in one of many pine-dressed vales.
~01~~panel_004.(Pine_Forest)~1_narration=Hillpainters of <overlandTile> prove trusting enough to tell <hunter> and the rest about a local treasure shelved up among the highest groves.
~01~~panel_005.(Swamp)~1_narration=Hillpainters of the wild fens are happy to speak of a remote and remarkable place, tucked up in the woody heights, away from the damp.
~01~~panel_006.(Other)~1_narration=Hillpainters of <overlandTile.bghps:the lowland woods point <hunter> and the company up towards the high groves, where a local treasure sits tucked away among pines and great roving bears./the lowland plains are happy to tell about Highforest House, a remarkable place hidden up among the pines./<overlandTile> have no qualms about sharing their knowledge, and speak of an isolate treasure here in one of many pine-dressed vales./<overlandTile> prove trusting enough to tell <hunter> and the rest about a local treasure tucked away in the highest groves./the wetlands are happy to speak of a remote and remarkable place, tucked up in the woody heights, away from the damp.>
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=It's not the tower from the book, nor any kind of Kyoren site. But it [ni]is[] a library.
~01~~panel_007~3_narration=The eccentric lorekeeper, <subPlot3.fullname> has purportedly collected books and scrolls for all <subPlot3.mf:his/her/their> journey-blessed life.
~01~~panel_007~4_hook=<hook.bookish/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:talking]A library's nearly as good. Imagine just talking to this old <subPlot3.mf:fellow/woman/person> will be illuminating./Possible that country-people's idea \nof a library won't match our own./[face:talking]To know more, you must find \nsomeone who [i]knows[] more./[face:interested]The fact it's so isolated is kind of encouraging, right? That's where heroes find stuff, usually./[face:dubious]We're wearing out our ankles for [i]more books[]?/Least a library's [i]something[].[face:interested] It's pretty out of the way, so you'd think it's got some rarities.>
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=The company's been hoping <subPlot3.lastname>'s collection might lead them to the tower they seek.
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=However...
~01~~panel_009~2_hook=That looks like...
~01~~panel_009~3_hunter=Yeah.
~01~~panel_010~3_hunter=<hunter.coward/goofball/snark/60:[face:grim]I hate that this happened./[face:neutral]No chance it's one of the old <subPlot3.mf:man/woman/lorekeeper>'s weird decorations, right?/Going to assume that's not \na seasonal decoration./Then they forfeit their lives.>
~01~~panel_010~4_speech=[white]Thrixl. They remain, milling in and out. Awaiting our arrival, it would seem.
~01~~panel_011~2_hook=<hook.ecthis_Elsee:Does Eluna... did she do this?/Does Ecthis know our plan?>
~01~~panel_012~4_speech=[white]<hook.ecthis_Elsee:Probably not her, but whatever Thrixl instruments she commands./Anything is possible. But lest we lose all hope, better we do not overcredit her.>
~01~~panel_013~4_speech=[white]Likely, she makes some effort to read the movements of things we come into contact with, and positions her pieces accordingly.
~01~~panel_013~5_hunter=<hunter.hunter:It's like trailing a ghostfox./[face:interested]That's... what does that mean?>
~01~~panel_013~6_hook=<hunter.hunter:<hook.hunter:[face:grim]Right./[face:skeptical]Is it?>/>
~01~~panel_014.(hunter_is_hunter).(hook_NOT_hunter)~5_hunter=You can only hope to see them when it rains. You watch where the water won't hit. See by displacement.
~01~~panel_015~4_speech=[white]<hunter.hunter:A fine example. Or think of/You can think of> trying to track the obsidian owl across a night with no moon. You would watch for the stars to blacken and rekindle.
~01~~panel_016~4_speech=[white]So, I believe, it must be for her, hoping to spot us under our shroud. The more we drag the rug, bump the furniture, the more visible we become.
~01~~panel_017~4_speech=[white]I shall patch our wards. Be safe.
~01~~panel_017~7_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/romantic/60:I'd have liked dearly to speak to that poor <subPlot3.mf:man/woman/Lorekeeper>. This place's a jewel, and I'm sure <subPlot3.mf:his/her/their> mind would have catalogued every flaw and facet.../[face:interested]No choice today. We'll be quick as we can, but it sounds like we need to limit risks like this in the future./The price this poor Lorekeeper paid... gives me a sick feeling.[face:sad]/No choice today. We'll be quick as we can, but it sounds like we need to limit risks like this in the future. For the sake of this world's lorekeepers, if nothing else./The price this poor Lorekeeper paid... gives me a sick feeling./Have to assume that warning up there is the Lorekeeper. We'll punish <subPlot3.mf:his/her/their> murderers, see if we can put <subPlot3.mf:his/her/their> life's work to any use.>
~01~~panel_018~8_hunter=All for a chance at a scrap of a clue...
