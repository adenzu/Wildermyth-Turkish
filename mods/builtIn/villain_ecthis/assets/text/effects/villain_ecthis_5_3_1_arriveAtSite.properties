Oh well./Feel like we used to take a lot for granted./All that's happened in the past decade and a half... yeah. At least we fell in love.

Lives, and deaths, and births. Time never stops, and people and their stories continue. Except...>/<mystic.greedy/healer/hothead/loner/60:It's devastatingly unfair. Being born in this time. Could've lived in that Mothman's age of glory: owned a castle, watched knights practice under the sun. But.../I know. So do all who live to see such times. But that's... well. You start thinking about what you might've fixed, right? But realize it's not just the worst things you'd undo. It's also the best things.[hook.face:interested]/That's a useless way to spend your energy. Eh, but you know that, don't you? Sorry, my runaway mouth. But I mean, my basic thought is.../Sometimes I kind of just want to get away. [i]Just us,[] and forget whatever's left to do. Could wait out the end. But as far as changing any of it?/[face:interested]You do? Sometimes I seriously have that dream. In my dream, it's all peaceful, green. But I'm always looking for you, and you're nowhere around.
