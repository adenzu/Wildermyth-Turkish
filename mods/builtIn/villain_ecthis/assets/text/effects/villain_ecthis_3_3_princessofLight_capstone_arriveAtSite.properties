~01~~panel_001~1_narration=[navy]The lush landscape swells. Shimmering scents blow by.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=Overhead, the clouds ball like string, yield thread \nto the intricate lineations of stratospheric lights.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=[navy]Pollensweet melodies drift from the swaying foliage. \nEphemeral warm hums fall on the ear like snow.
~01~~panel_003~4_npc=The colors don't ever stay the same.
~01~~panel_004~4_npc=All doors go somewhere.
~01~~panel_004~5_hook=But it's... where [i]are[] we?
~01~~panel_004~6_action=[blue][actionSmall]skoo!
~01~~panel_005~1_hook=Terrafract. But is any of it... [i]real[]?
~01~~panel_006~1_npc=This's the other side of the Glimrseen. [i]Terrafract[] is our word for it. I don't know if the Thrixl call it anything but home.
~01~~panel_007~4_npc=Oh, it's all real. Palpable. Flavorful. See, naked of its shell, reality's this soft, pliable thing. Here, there are very few hard laws to contain it.
~01~~panel_008~1_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/healer/leader/poet/romantic/60:That's beautifully stated, but I'm not sure [i]precisely[] what it signifies./[face:happy]Reality's a pinkish crab-thing?/That's an interesting idea. Uh. But I'm also not sure I understand, sorry./[face:neutral]That's nicely stated, but I'm not sure I understand your thrust./That's strangely pretty, but also... [i]unsteadying[]. Can you give examples?/<hook.villainEcthis_fromHometown:<hook.villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:Folks said/I remember> you always had a magnificent way with words. I'm sorry, it's hypnotic./Were you always so eloquent? I'm sorry, your voice is... hypnotic.>/[face:skeptical]And that means... what?>
~01~~panel_009~1_npc=<hook.bookish/goofball/healer/leader/poet/romantic/60:[face:skeptical]Yeah, maybe an example, like.../[face:skeptical]Erm. No, I'll put it this way./[face:skeptical]Yeah, I'm being too symbolic, aren't I? Let me try a different... how about.../[face:interested]Alright, sure, so think about.../[face:skeptical]Examples. Hm, well.../[face:happy]That's alright. It's good speaking to someone like this. Again. Um./[face:skeptical]Hm, okay, it means, like...>
~01~~panel_010~4_npc=Here, winds are born of wondering. Here, imagining the golden glow of a bitten plum, you might make the stars turn amber and drip out of the night. Here, every fantasy you have might be constellated around you, articulated, whole, interactive, but always morphing...
~01~~panel_010~6_action=[actionSmall][blue]huff...
~01~~panel_011~1_hook=Weird. I mean, it seems stable to me.
~01~~panel_012~1_npc=I'm holding it still, mostly. I don't want you to be overwhelmed.
~01~~panel_013~5_hook=But, okay, I'm sorry, and I'm kind of losing my grasp on things. But in my dream...
~01~~panel_014~1_hook=I'll come alone, then.
~01~~panel_014~2_npc=You'd be throwing your lives away. For a person who's been gone so long, she... I... can barely remember Elsee's face...
~01~~panel_015~4_npc=Oh, well, yeah.
~01~~panel_015~5_hook=You were imprisoned. You were afraid. And. [i]Weren't you?[]
~01~~panel_016~1_npc=But then I was able to forge a way out. See, I found I had the power to [i]traverse[] this world.
~01~~panel_017~1_npc=I was born with that power. The same way you were, <hook>...
~01~~panel_018~1_speech=[white]Forgive me for interrupting, but I am absolutely [i]itching[] to comment.
~01~~panel_019~2_speech=[white]I am but lately arrived.
~01~~panel_019~3_npc=No?
~01~~panel_019~4_hook=He's here, too?
~01~~panel_020~2_speech=[white]You seem so kind, so resourceful. But to paraphrase a dear friend, seeming is a weapon we wield like a sword. Is it not?
~01~~panel_020~3_npc=Wait.
~01~~panel_021~1_hook=<hook.villainEcthis_seenMothman:[face:skeptical]How do you know the Mothman?/[face:skeptical]Isn't this the Mothman?>
~01~~panel_022~1_speech=[white]Milady, I am done waiting. My hesitation has only ever brought others pain.
~01~~panel_023~1_npc=[i]You're[] acquainted with this... this cosmic vagrant? This lightlorn lostling?
~01~~panel_023~2_hook=<hook.villainEcthis_seenMothman:Uh, yeah. He helped us \nsave your sister, actually./I do know he's helped us before. \nHelped us save your sister, in fact.>
~01~~panel_024~1_speech=[white]Erm, I fear that may be true.
~01~~panel_025~1_npc=Did you know he's the reason this all happened? The blood leads back to him.
~01~~panel_026~1_speech=[white]Call it an accident of fate, little owl. \nPerhaps, one day, I will explain in full.
~01~~panel_026~3_hook=<hook.goofball/loner/snark/60:[face:grim]Everyone we lost? That's... that's very sad. I wanted to like you.../[face:grim]Everyone that died, huh? Everyone that was taken? And Eluna herself?/[face:dubious]And I urged the others to trust you./You mean you...?! Everyone that's been taken? Hurt? Killed?>
~01~~panel_027~1_speech=[white]For now, I may only unmask her.
~01~~panel_028~2_npc=How could you even hope to...?
~01~~panel_029~1_speech=[white]An old keepsake...
~01~~panel_029~2_narration=From under his hat, the Mothman produces a moon.
~01~~panel_030~2_speech=[white]Here, she may obscure her shadow. \nBut the glow of home is ever honest.
~01~~panel_031~2_npc=Sss... top...! H...how!?
~01~~panel_032~1_narration=She splits into a momentary spectrum of presence...
~01~~panel_032~3_action=[darkPurple]. . . . . . .
~01~~panel_032~4_action=[navy]. . . . . . .
~01~~panel_032~5_action=[maroon]. . . . . . .
~01~~panel_033~1_speech=[white]Enough.
~01~~panel_033~2_narration=...then resolves.
~01~~panel_033~3_speech=[white]Look what they have wrought \nfrom the girl who was Eluna.
~01~~panel_034~1_speech=[white]I [i]wrought[] myself. [i]You[] should \nunderstand what that means.
~01~~panel_035~1_narration=The borrowed moon withers in his hands.
~01~~panel_036~1_npc4=[white]All I wanted, dear <hook>, was to ease you towards the truth. \nBut now you've seen me, please understand... it's for the best.
~01~~panel_036~2_narration=Her shape returns to normal. Her voice, however, exercises its profound new depth, \nunfurling words that are heart-glazing, assuring, and powerful.
~01~~panel_037~1_npc4=[white]I am no longer Eluna Arcwright as you knew her. But I've become something greater. Ecthis is my name. Ecthis, Queen of Light.
~01~~panel_037~3_speech=[white]I believe we all would \nhave preferred Eluna.
~01~~panel_038~1_speech=[white]No. Eluna was anything but frail, that much is obvious. \nA coward like me knows courage when he sees it.
~01~~panel_039~1_npc4=[white]I'm sure [i]you[] would. You like us frail and ignorant.
~01~~panel_040~1_npc4=[white]You never knew me. You weren't down in that pit with us. I wasn't pulled out, I [i]emerged[] from the muck, and I did it because I was... I'm different. This world was too much for the others, but I [i]mastered[] it. The Thrixl brought me to this place... but I made myself its [i]Queen[].
~01~~panel_041~1_speech=[white]A queen must prove her patience, milady. You are a princess, still.
~01~~panel_042~1_npc4=[white]You're asking for my intolerance. Better for you if you remove yourself.
~01~~panel_043~1_hook=<hook.hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:[face:angry]/[face:grim]/[face:neutral]/[face:skeptical]/[face:talking]>Please, though, El... Lady Ecthis. \n[i]Queen[] Ecthis, if that's what you like.
~01~~panel_044~1_npc4=[white]<hook.personality:[face:grim]Shut up. I know, and I [i]control[] every cell of my body./Angry? No, I'm.../[face:interested]You're a pair of clowns./You... sort of have it./[face:grim][i]Heal me.[] Those words are disappointing to hear./[face:neutral]I was interrupted before I could finish./Oh, uh... No./[face:neutral]Your perception is correct. But there's.../Oh. You don't understand.[face:neutral]/[face:interested]Oh, no, I was just tricking you. But.../[face:grim]Hm, right. I was interrupted.>
~01~~panel_044~4_hook=<hook.personality:[face:neutral]I admit I'm startled. I even admit I'm... intrigued, morbid as that may sound, and I'm sorry to the girl you were, if she's in there. But--/[face:interested]I get it if you're angry with us. We were too slow to save you, and there's no excuse I can make, but... are you going to kill us? Or why'd you lure me here?/[face:happy]You must've liked my smile, right? That's why you singled me out? Because if that's not it, I'm sort of confused why I'm here now./[face:talking]Whatever you're [i]seeking[]... I must be able to help you. Right? That's why I'm here? We can make a bargain. /[face:sad]We're sorry we didn't reach you in time. But come back with me, now. Talk to your sister. We can help you, maybe even find a way to [i]heal[] you, or.../[face:grim]You made a fool of me, right? I won't pretend I'm not galled by that. But... but [i]why[]? What did you gain by getting me here?/[face:talking]You brought me here. I see it was... all some trick, right? But why? You're hoping I'll bring you home, isn't that still it?/[face:neutral]I think I sense you're far from desiring any kind of [i]escape[] from this place. So just why did you call me here?/[face:talking]Maybe I'm caught in a web you've woven... or maybe we both are. Come back with me. Talk to your sister. Why else did you bring me here?/[face:talking]You called me here. Crossed the fabric of dreams, or... whatever that is. And maybe it was to ensnare me, or maybe, deep down... didn't you still [i]want[] to be saved?/[face:talking]I'm not going to pretend I don't find this whole thing... [i]really[] confusing. But it seems like you wanted me here. And, well, I'm here. So what's the plan?>
~01~~panel_045~1_npc4=[white]Look, it's not complicated, <hook>. This's our time. We're ascendant. And I mean [i]all[] of us. Together. Humanity. <hook.mystic:You have the gift that was dormant in me./The power is dormant in you, as it was in me.>
~01~~panel_046~1_npc4=[white]Even this 'Mothman' of yours could join us. I don't mind. It's not important. And yes, the Thrixl destroyed lives, searching for me. [i]Too many[] lives. But I'm here now. I'll lead the world into a new epoch, and I'll fashion you as my first and finest companion, and...
~01~~panel_046~2_speech=[white]I cannot let that happen.
~01~~panel_048~2_npc4=[white]Ah, but you must see it. It's already [i]happening.[]
~01~~panel_048~3_speech=[white]You can buy wings at any costume shop, these days.
~01~~panel_049~1_npc4=[white]Regardless, it's just a matter of time, now. And I await the res--
~01~~panel_049~2_speech=[white]In that case, I will stop the clock.
~01~~panel_050~1_speech=[white]I have only ever acted late. Dear bird. Consider this my apology.
~01~~panel_050~2_hook=But, what?
~01~~panel_052~1_speech=[white]She is too powerful for any of us, but I have a few tricks left. One day, I shall come and tell you everything. For now, though...
~01~~panel_054~1_narration=A crackling flash announces <hook>'s sudden unbuckling. <hook.mf:He falls/She falls/They fall> through a tunnel of luminous abstraction...
~01~~panel_055~1_ship=<hook>!
~01~~panel_055~2_narration=...into broad bland daylight.
~01~~panel_055~3_narration=<hook.mf:He appears/She appears/They appear> to <ship.krfln.hook:<hook.mf:his/her/their> <ship.pcfn.hook:<ship.mf:father/mother/parent>/child/<ship.mf:brother/sister/sibling>'s frantic eyes and searching calls/==>/<ship>'s stunned gaze/the disbelieving eyes of <hook.mf:his/her/their> longtime friend/the hoping eyes of <hook.mf:his/her/their> lover like a dream/an unfamiliar pair of searching eyes> and <hook.mf:staggers/staggers/stagger> against mossy rocks.
~01~~panel_056~1_ship=<ship.rfln.hook:[face:skeptical]You're... [i]<hook.mf:him/her/them>[], right?/[face:interested]Hey, you alright? \nEasy there.../[face:interested]It's okay. You're here, now./[face:interested]Whoa, are you...?>
~01~~panel_056~2_hook2=Oh. I've got...
~01~~panel_057~1_hook2=I feel weird.
~01~~panel_057~2_ship=<hook.mf:He's/She's/They're> over here.
~01~~panel_057~3_hunter=We owe that Mothman one more time, huh?
~01~~panel_057~4_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:But are those... [i]wings[]?/>
~01~~panel_058~1_ship=<ship.rfln.hook:[face:angry]Moron!/[face:grim]<hook.mf:He's/She's/They're> weak./[face:sad]Easy now, easy!/[face:surprised]Oh!>
~01~~panel_058~2_narration=<hook> promptly faints, <ship> catching <hook.mf:him/her/them> before <hook.mf:he falls/she falls/they fall> too hard.
~01~~panel_058~3_hook2=[small]Gwek.
~01~~panel_059~1_narration=Thrixl surge out of the openfolding air.
~01~~panel_059~3_hunter=We should get off their doorstep.
~01~~panel_060~4_action=[darkBlue][actionSmall]Sklllvkk!!
~01~~panel_060~5_action=[navy]Skleeg!!
~01~~panel_060~6_ship=<hook>'s vulnerable. <ship.coward/goofball/snark/60:[face:interested]Can't exactly move away safely, can we?/[face:interested]Can't exactly move away safely, can we?/[face:skeptical]I'm just going to focus on keeping <hook.mf:him/her/them> alive./Have to make a wall. And hope for the best?>
~01~~panel_060~7_hunter=Hold out as long as we can, then.
