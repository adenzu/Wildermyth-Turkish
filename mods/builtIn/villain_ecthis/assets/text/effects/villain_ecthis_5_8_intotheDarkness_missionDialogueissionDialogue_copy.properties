~01~~panel_001~1_speech=[light]Your ferocity amounts to nothing.\nJust the bites of tiny mosquitoes.\nI feel nothing I don't wish to feel.
~01~~panel_002~3_hook=<hook.personality:[face:talking]Anyone who's studied them knows a mosquito's bite, small though it may seem, can introduce illness to the blood. Eventual death./[face:skeptical]Is that [i]true?[] I can't tell when she's lying. \nShould I just assume she is?/[face:happy]Oh yeah? I'm pretty good at annoying folks. You're just asking me to try harder.../Mosquito bites are pretty wretched, though, right? You know, your talk just makes me more stubborn.[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]You can still stand down. We will, too. Stop this battle, and we can find a way to coexist!/[face:angry]Yeah? You want us to hit harder? We [i]will![] For <hook.mystic:every innocent heart you'd be happy to snuff!/every ordinary idiot like us, who you'd wipe away without a thought!>/We've been called all kinds of bird-names, at this point.
