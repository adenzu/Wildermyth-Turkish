~01~~panel_001~2_narration=The fourth such day<volunteer.exists:, they decide, \nsuddenly and as a group, to go./, \n<hook.mf:he/she/they> decides rather suddenly to go.>
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=The sun's already low when <volunteer.exists:they embark/<hook.mf:he embarks/she embarks/they embark>>.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=It'll be twenty years before anyone returns to the Tower of Locks.
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=<leader> will guide a team of volunteers into those \nmountains. Finding the door still barred and intact, \n<leader.mf:he/she/they>'ll lead the monumental task of burying the place.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=And that's, more or less, how things finish.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=We can't recall every turn \nof every path or page.
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=Step by step, trails meet and split. Are traced in moonlight and the songs that follow.
~01~~panel_006~2_narration=Still, as many wonders as we see on the road,\nhome is often what we long for, by road's end.
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=While home was never a perfect place...
~01~~panel_007~4_action=[action][brown]SQUECLH!
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=...we never were perfect people.
~01~~panel_008~5_action=[actionSmall][pink]SNRT!
~01~~panel_009.(bookish_exists)~2_bookish=<bookish.personality:[face:neutral]We got romanced by vagaries, moled down in studies that left us blinking in the dark./[face:interested]We were never the courageous heroes folks wanted to call us./[face:happy]We joked and jostled our way through sorrows we feared to face./[face:joke]We weren't shy to accept credit./We wanted to save everyone, but that was never going to be possible./[face:skeptical]We hurried into trouble, unsure how we might escape it./[face:grim]We felt responsibility for things we couldn't change./[face:skeptical]We weren't your friendly neighbors./[face:grim]We tended to take our words too seriously./[face:happy]We forgot ourselves in smiles, and relished every compliment we collected./We treated earnest folks with skepticism.[face:skeptical>
~01~~panel_010.(mystic_exists)~2_mystic=<mystic.personality:Our curiosity frequently flew us up trees. We couldn't always clamber down alone./We who used to sleep in moonbeams... We ever after were worried what world we might wake to./We got our feet stuck in snares, and laughed about the damage. We felt it, nonetheless./We gave of ourselves much more than we'd wanted, and couldn't hide, sometimes, the pain of that loss.[face:grim]/We cared with abandon, reached through fire for trapped hands. And came back with nothing but charred fists full of smoke.[face:happy]/We threw ourselves onto winds that couldn't carry us, trusting our unproven capacity to fly.[face:joy]/We made foolish choices in the moonlight, and carried the weight of them everafter.[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]We loved each other, but didn't often know how to say it./We never felt wholly [i]finished[]. A lot of times, we looked for meaning in the unmeant./We made foolish choices in the moonlight, and carried the weight of them everafter.[face:happy]/We paid for our doubts as well as our decisions. We rarely got away unscathed.[face:dubious]>
~01~~panel_011.(warrior_exists)~2_narration=Some of us were only unlucky enough to fall into a story.
~01~~panel_012.(hunter_exists)~1_narration=<warrior.exists:<child.exists:Some/And some of us>/Some of us> chose our paths, not knowing where they'd take us, how deep we'd go into wildernesses beyond all we'd believed.
~01~~panel_013.(child_exists)~1_narration=<hunter.exists:And some/<warrior.exists:And some/Some of us>> carried on in the ashes of love. \n\n                      We claimed what we could from the wreck of childhood, \n                             left all but the ghosts behind.
~01~~panel_014~2_narration=Yes, and some survive only in yarns.
~01~~panel_014~3_narration=The tales of how this moon rose are as plentiful as the nights we gather.
~01~~panel_014~4_narration=But we'll gather. And tell them all.
~01~~panel_014~5_action=[actionSmall][orange]spark!
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=Because, through tale and time,
~01~~panel_015~2_narration=memories of the old
~01~~panel_015~3_narration=become dreams of the young.
~01~~panel_016~1_speech=[white]Memories and dreams, those lightless gleams that our eyes seek unfinding,
~01~~panel_016~2_speech=[white]they take us from tables and summon us home,
~01~~panel_016~3_speech=[white]warmly felt and everfading.
~01~~panel_025.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]Hm.
~01~~panel_026.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white][i]This.[] Is all I'm doomed to have.
~01~~panel_027.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]Into the sum of eternity, or until eternity uncoils...
~01~~panel_028.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~3_speech=[white]At least you will not be alone.
~01~~panel_029.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]I [i]will[] be. When I decide to kill you.
~01~~panel_030.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~5_speech=[white]See? There is something to look forward to!\nYou really are in an enviable position, my Queen.
~01~~panel_031.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]That word sounds so mocking from your lips.\nAnd... yes. I deserve to be mocked.
~01~~panel_032.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]I intend no mockery.
~01~~panel_033.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]I deserve immortal humiliation \nfor letting you best me.
~01~~panel_034.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]Please. Perhaps our lives will find some natural, albeit very prolonged end.  \nOr perhaps, many years down the line, some fool will open that door on us, \nand you will fly free again. Dream of that, dear Ecthis. By all means, do.
~01~~panel_035.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]But in the meantime. Two beings such as us, \npossessed of powers to make illusions seem real... \nif we show but a little willingness to be fooled...
~01~~panel_036.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]Can we not find some way to make the passage \nof eternity even [i]slightly[] less terrible to endure?
~01~~panel_037.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~6_speech=[white]Ha!
~01~~panel_041.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_npc4=[white]You sure love the bath.
~01~~panel_042.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_subPlot3=[white]It always [i]was[] one of my great joys! \nNot many have the privilege of knowing so!
~01~~panel_043.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_subPlot3=[white]Oh, as you command!
~01~~panel_043.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~3_npc4=[white]Come back and create more trees. Show me how you get them to look so... treeish. So natural.
~01~~panel_044.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_subPlot3=[white]But my Queen, I must mention... the way you work wonders with water and sky, I doubt I will have much more to show you before long. I suppose, then, you will dispose of me?
~01~~panel_046.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_subPlot3=[white]At once, my Queen.
~01~~panel_046.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~3_npc4=[white]Come along.
~01~~panel_047.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~6_speech=[white]How is that?
~01~~panel_048.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~5_speech=[white]It is a rare breed, these evergreens you have chosen. You like them?
~01~~panel_049.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~5_speech=[white]Yes. Upright and still. Stoic to the end.
~01~~panel_049.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~6_speech=[white]I do like the way they live and die.
~01~~panel_050.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~5_speech=[white]Of course, Ecthis. Whenever you like.
~01~~panel_050.(company_is_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~6_speech=[white]Can we dream ourselves trees?
~01~~panel_054.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]Ulgh.
~01~~panel_055.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_action=[actionSmall]slmp.
~01~~panel_056.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]What're you doing?
~01~~panel_058.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]How extraordinary.\nHe's [i]dying...[]
~01~~panel_060.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_narration=Some time later...
~01~~panel_063.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]Hm.
~01~~panel_064.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]Your life's been exhaustingly comfortable.
~01~~panel_065.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~3_speech=[white]And none of my comforts well-earned. You might understand, then, why even a gallant man's conscience weighs heavy.
~01~~panel_066.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]All I understand is you \nlack proper appreciation.
~01~~panel_067.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]Not that. Anyway, I'll likely kill you myself, when I'm sick of you. No...
~01~~panel_067.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_speech=[white]For saving my life? I cannot be sure I should thank you for it.
~01~~panel_068.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]Given? I believe the [i]cost[] of these gifts is what I eventually soured on.
~01~~panel_069.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]You show no appreciation for the gifts we've been given.
~01~~panel_070.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~6_speech=[white]We lost our ties to... to everyone. Lost our families, even our own flesh. The Thrixl, poor aimless dreamers, tangled or wrangled us into their world, and it struck first as misfortune. And yet...
~01~~panel_071.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]For our sacrifice, we've been able to live equal to any wonder. Any goddess or god. King or Queen.
~01~~panel_072.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]And for such imaginative beings, it was startling for me to discover... the Thrixl had no concept what a nightmare truly was. Until I showed them. Do you understand?
~01~~panel_073.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_speech=[white]Call me a moth in your web, dear Ecthis: \nI am compelled. What are you saying?
~01~~panel_074.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_speech=[white]I speak of our natures, human and Thrixl. And the dominance of one over the other. Thrixl exist without desire. Their world, where the mind's whims are made manifest, is balanced precisely because they don't [i]wish[].
~01~~panel_076.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]A human heart, however, like mine... We are composed entirely of wishing. Of wanting. In Terrafract, it makes us [i]all-commanding[].
~01~~panel_077.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]I suppose I knew as much already.
~01~~panel_077.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_speech=[white]I know you did. That's what frustrated me. You'd seen and known all that I got to know. And yet you'd refused to make anything of it. I didn't wish, necessarily, to rule the world...
~01~~panel_078.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]And they did.
~01~~panel_078.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_speech=[white]But I didn't feel like the world deserved any better. \nLet someone stop me, if they could.
~01~~panel_079.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white] Ah. Well.
~01~~panel_079.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~3_speech=[white]Yes. They did. [i]You[] did. So why do I find you so disappointingly joyless. \nSo without the smug triumph I would've expected?
~01~~panel_080.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_speech=[white]The thing I did not anticipate... was that I would survive. \nCaught flightless, and forced to see you flightless.\nI confess, it has me feeling rather doleful.
~01~~panel_080.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_speech=[white]Yes. That.
~01~~panel_080.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~3_speech=[white]The fact we're trapped in a dusty old tower for eternity?
~01~~panel_081.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_speech=[white]Maybe. Partly.
~01~~panel_081.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~3_speech=[white]Is it the moon you miss?
~01~~panel_081.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~4_speech=[white]I can give you the moon.
~01~~panel_083.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~1_subPlot3=[white]It does look... and feel... so [i]authentic[].
~01~~panel_083.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_npc4=[white]You expected less from me?
~01~~panel_084.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~5_speech=[white]I suppose you are the Queen of Light!
~01~~panel_084.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~6_speech=[white]And I'll remind you who [i]you[] are, Moth Prince.
~01~~panel_085.(company_NOT_ecthis_WhenYouAreOld)~2_npc4=[white]The two of us can still make \nanything we'd wish for.
~01~~panel_087~3_action=[header][silver] The End.
