That's all./[face:neutral]Could've done more. Could've saved more. It's still the wrong time to relax./I’ll stay as long as I sense the threat’s not gone. But you know, we don’t have to interact./We go by a simple rule. [i]If you don't see an arrow land, assume it didn't.[]/[face:neutral]Hm? Oh, there's a lovely greengrower. I've been helping <leader.awm:her/him> turn <leader.awm:her/his> earth, and watching the wind. You know my way, don't you?/I'm not convinced anything's over. Are you?>/<leader.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/loner/poet/romantic/60:We're missing something. The truth's still locked away somewhere, and I feel the key... the key will present itself. If I just stay. And wait./[face:skeptical]It's weird. I can't quite... look at the wilderness the same. Knowing they're out there./[face:happy]I don't know. Reasons aren't always obvious. It's just the naturallest thing./[face:talking]Tell you the truth, I could get used to a bed and a roof. I'm not ashamed to say so./I may go in the <season+2>. Just don't feel set. After all that, don't know what's right./We have a saying. [i]If you don't see an arrow land, assume it didn't.[] The threat's alive in my mind./[face:neutral]Hm? Oh, there's a lovely greengrower, lives by the creek. I've been helping <leader.awm:her/him> turn <leader.awm:her/his> earth. And reading the wind. You know my way./Hard to make a case for going home. What'll stop it all from happening again? Better I'm here.>/<leader.hothead/leader/loner/poet/snark/80:Yeah, that's the way it goes. I'm needed here. Wherever [i]you[] are, in case those things come crawling back./[face:neutral]No. My people are here. My people is you, and the ones you want to protect. Someone needs to stay watchful./[face:neutral]They're not like that, you know? We meet when we meet. Or we don't. I'm fine here./We have a saying. [i]If you don't see an arrow land, assume it didn't.[] The threat's alive in my mind./[face:dubious]Anxious for me to go?/[face:interested]Can't really imagine leaving your side, right now. Is that embarrassing to admit?>/==>/<leader.villainEcthis_olderSiblingHero:<ship.rfln.leader:<ship.villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:Whatever. Remember when Mom was alive? [i]Everyone[] was. We were just two useless kids. That's all I think about, sometimes./You don't have to come vulturing around, either. Let me remember in peace.>/<ship.villainEcthis_youngerSiblingHero:<leader.goofball/greedy/hothead/poet/60:[face:interested]What, second I don't smile, I'm having a crisis? Naw, I'm just... remembering. Some kids we knew./[face:skeptical]Could've brought a drink, at least. I'm just remembering. How much better it all was./Just wishing we'd been faster. I'd face a hundred more mantoids to bring back that poor girl's sister. You know? Wouldn't you?/Teeth punched out of a smile: homes that won't ever light up again. <ship>, it's awful. It [i]is[]. I won't ever not remember them./[face:neutral]Hard not to spot the missing faces... at any table I sit down at. So. That's all.>/<leader.goofball/hothead/snark/60:I think that's why. The contrarian in me, <leader.mf:he doesn't/she doesn't/they don't> like to do what anyone says. Even myself.[face:happy]/Wanted to run. Wanted to shout in all the empty windows. [face:angry]It's still not right, you know? And I feel like the peace is a dumb lie./[face:neutral]Yeah, I lied. Just couldn't sit in there playing cards. There's faces missing./[face:neutral]But then I got up and started walking past empty black windows. Used to have lights in them. And all this calm felt like a lie.>>/<ship.villainEcthis_prodigalWarriorHero:<leader.bookish/coward/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:talking]Everything in books says worried love wilts faster. My mom was wise about <ship.mf:men/women/love>. She'd say it better, and I'd believe it more./[face:grim]I know. Sorry, if... well. Uh, I'm okay. Are you? Come stand with me. I'm remembering too much./[face:neutral]I'm good, <ship>. I am. I'm sad for those we couldn't save. But I'm proud we didn't stop. And I'm proud... of you and me./[face:interested]Mm. Yeah. It [i]is[] strange. Will you... come stand here next to me? And hug me?/I remember you always looked like a hero. And now I'm older,[face:happy] you still do. Come talk with me./[face:happy]Not strange to me. Think I imagined this for a long time. But yes, I'm fine. Did you need me to say goodnight?/[face:happy]You know, you still close your eyes when you kiss me. It's cute. So come here. I'll keep watch./[face:happy]I'm fine. And yeah, I agree. You seem to have gotten extremely lucky.>/<leader.goofball/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:neutral]Yes. And I'm washed and perfumed, under a romantic sky. Almost as if someone planned it./[face:neutral]Mm. Come kiss me./[face:neutral]I'm alright. My mind's been on the lost ones, is all. You could hug me and it'd help./[face:neutral]Sorry to disappoint you. Just \ncaught me ogling the sky./[face:interested]Sorry. Only watching the night. Remembering faces I'll never see again.>>/===>/<leader.rfln.ship:Me? Huh./Yeah.../I.../==> <leader.bookish/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/60:[face:talking]My thoughts have turned to <season+1>, and <season+2>. Mulling how to prepare, I suppose./[face:talking]Sorry if I'm making you anxious, or if I'm keeping you up. Just thought I'd... be watchful./<leader.villainEcthis_fromHometown:We/You> have to be ready. Thrixl've got a taste for our blood now. [i]You[] think it's over? No chance of that. No chance./Important for someone to keep watch, is all. Might as well be me./[face:neutral]I'm just out here, sometimes. Nothing to talk about, just making sure things don't change./[face:interested]Just watching the night change./[face:neutral]Yeah, don't worry. I'm only watching the sky for a while. Thinking silly things.>>>/<leader.bookish/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/60:[face:talking]It's me, yes. My thoughts have turned to <season+1>, and <season+2>. I'm mulling how to prepare, I suppose./[face:talking]Mayor <npc.lastname>, you should't be up. Sorry if I'm making you anxious. Just keeping watch./<leader.villainEcthis_fromHometown:We/You> have to be ready. They've got a taste for our blood, now, and they'll come back for it./That's right. Important for someone to keep watch. Get some sleep, <npc.mf:Mister Mayor/Miss Mayor/Good Mayor>./[face:neutral]I'm out here, yeah. It's alright. Go inside./[face:interested]Was I whistling? Sorry. Just watching the night change, thinking what the turning seasons will bring./[face:neutral]Yeah, don't worry. I'm only watching the sky for a while. Thinking silly things.>>
