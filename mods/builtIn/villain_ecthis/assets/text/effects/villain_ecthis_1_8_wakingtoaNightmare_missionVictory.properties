~01~~panel_005~1_narration=By night, most have had a chance to remember themselves, try to piece together what happened. An impromptu council is held in the home of the <npc3.mf:Schoolmaster/Schoolmistress/Schoolmaster>.
~01~~panel_005~2_npc3=Wish that reasoning was clear to me, now.
~01~~panel_005~3_npc2=Under their spell, it all\nmade sense.
~01~~panel_006~2_npc3=And the young ones, they took.
~01~~panel_006~3_npc2=At least the bits and images we remember... feel solid. All us old folks, they let live. Left us in charge, maybe to fool passers through.
