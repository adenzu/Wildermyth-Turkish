Consider this: if we hadn't been here, sharing in [i]your[] battles, you'd be dead./[face:skeptical]I mean, I don't want to say anything that's going to get me punched, but really... the fact you're alive is probably due to the fact we followed you, right?/[face:joke]Shouldn't you be cooking us breakfast, anywhich morning we wake? I just mean, because... well the way we've been saving your bacon!?/[face:talking]Put candidly, it was the fact you stole that book from us... that's the only reason we followed you, and we're the only reason you're still alive. You owe us, wouldn't you say?/[face:talking]I mean, I've just noticed that, for instance, in that fight back there... what if we'd never come after you? You made it tough on us. And would you have survived otherwise?/[face:angry]Honestly, it's kind of ratty of you to walk around treating us like tagalongs. Look at that battle back there. You would've died without us./[face:talking]I know it's not news to you that you'd be dead if <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>> and I weren't with you. In Eldstone, or in the madness just now. Think it'd be good for you to acknowledge that./[face:grim][i]I[] don't want your thanks. But it's annoying to let you walk around like a hero when you needed me and <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>> to save you back there./[face:talking]The bear in <npc2.lastname>'s fables was a fool because <warrior.mf:he/she/they> walked the forest calling <warrior.mf:himself its king/herself its queen/themself its master>, but when the other woodland beings left, <warrior.mf:he was/she was/they were> starved into following [i]them[]./[face:skeptical]I feel like <bookish.mf:my brother/my sister/<bookish>> and I deserve more credit. We're keeping you alive. Our abilities, our daring feats and all... I know if I'd done this much for <mystic.awm:the Miller's daughter, she'd/the Miller's son, he'd> be fawning over me, and.../[face:surprised]Or, oh! Now I get it! You're going to throw us a big feast, as thanks for basically saving your life, right? And invite all the <mystic.awm:brightest women/brightest men> from across the land!?>/<mystic.coward/goofball/hothead/poet/60:[face:interested]Was nicer when we [i]didn't[] know, maybe. About the Thrixl and the mothmen and any of this. But seems like... not knowing was probably [i]more[] dangerous./[face:happy]And no, I don't especially [i]like[] this new duty of mine. \nOf throwing splinters in a stag weevil's eye. But it's \ngood to be aware. That the rousty old bugs're out there./[face:grim]You can be a pain in the eye. But all this that's happening... good knowing we're not blind to it. And that's because of you./[face:talking]It's all still unimaginable. But as <npc2.fullname> was purported to have said, "The Beast cares not whether you can put <npc2.mf:him/her/him> into words." Better to know and be burdened with knowing, than be caught unawares./[face:neutral]Maybe you did it unwittingly, but you brought us out of our ignorance. We were ready for [i]none[] of this.>/<mystic.personality:[face:interested]This's coming from a <mystic.mf:boy/girl/kid> who a lot of folks describe with words like... dusty. Or shut-in. Or bookdank, is one I've even heard, which... Um, but that's the person these sentiments are coming from, okay? I, uh... I think you're special. And I... want. To be. With you./[face:interested]And it's something I [i]want[] to tell you... but also I [i]don't[] want to tell you, because then it means I'll have [i]told you[] and that'll mean you [i]know[], in which case I'll... um. I like you. Um, but if...!/[face:happy]I can't think of a better time to say this. I mean, we're all dirty and streaked in Thrixl-blood which... it smells like ink, doesn't it? Um, but, to the point at hand, I want to say I love you. I'm pretty sure./I'm not the type to sell myself short, you know?[face:talking] But when I saw you, and now, as we've gone through some things together... I can tell that I like you. And I'd feel extremely [i]lucky[] if you were interested in regular old me. So.../[face:talking]Recognize this's... I mean it's almost reckless, but I think if I don't say it, it'll make things weirder. Also, this way, if you don't like it, I can work on getting over it. Um, so the thing is that, I... am falling for you. Hard. And.../[face:skeptical]You like me, right? You must. Because the thing is, I'm pretty much all the way fallen for you, and it's got me kind of impatient. And I feel like we'd just kind of work, wouldn't we?/[face:talking]It's time I just said it, be straightforward with it. I've been falling for you. Probably since I first saw you. And you don't have to worry, I can get over anything if I have to, but... I don't want to have to./[face:neutral]This's what's known in romance books as the confession. I'm confessing. I think you're attractive, and your presence... is good. I like you being around, and I like being around you./[face:talking]There's a western breed of aspen that'll only grow beside a pine. The Yearningtree, it's known as. Or it used to be. I've started to feel like that Aspen. Um, next to you. A redwood. A beautiful, strong, redwood. And I.../[face:sad]I'm sure you've listened to me sigh, seen my tortured gaze startle away when you turn to me, and you... you smile. I go weak. I do! And I can't contain it any longer, I'm falling for you [i]so[] hard, and.../[face:skeptical]I thought of this funny idea. This weird kind of... situation. What if I were to tell you... that I [i]love you[]? Or something? I mean, [i]that[] would be weird! What would you even say? If I just...>> --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters
