~01~~panel_001~8_narration=[white]As her Thrixl drop in severed heaps, Ecthis sinks. Radiance all but drowned, \n          she recedes once more into the murk of the Mothman's spell.\n  \n                                  Drifting.
~01~~panel_002~6_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:<volunteer.ecthis_Elsee:[face:sad]/>They both lied to us. She's not invincible. And he's no coward./>
~01~~panel_002~7_hook=<volunteer.exists:/<hook.ecthis_Elsee:Sorry, Eluna.[face:sad]/You lied to us, Mothman. You're no coward at all.>>
~01~~panel_002~8_narration=[white]An eerie tranquility floods the hall. The flux of colors is slow and forceful, a laketide. Both of these immortal beings are like ruins themselves, motionless in prismatic depths.
~01~~panel_003~6_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:<volunteer.ecthis_Elsee:[face:grim]/>Yeah./>
~01~~panel_003~7_hook=<volunteer.exists:Time to go, <volunteer>./No time for better goodbyes. \nBut... thanks.>
~01~~panel_004~1_action=[tan]Clunk!
~01~~panel_004~6_narration=<volunteer.exists:<volunteer2.exists:They emerge from/They emerge from>/<hook.mf:He/She/<hook>> emerges from> the tower, heaving the door shut \non the roiling bitter miracle inside.

~01~~panel_005~4_action=[light][actionSmall]...slunk!
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=The stones mumble. A faint gloss rolls along their surfaces. \nAnd the Tower of Locks seems to firm.
~01~~panel_007~7_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:<hook>? <volunteer.rfln.hook:Any smart ideas left?/They don't seem to think it's over./[face:grim]Doesn't seem like it's over, love./What now, you think?>/>
~01~~panel_007~8_hook=Hm.[face:grim]<volunteer.exists:/ Big audience.>
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=The Thrixl crowd quiet, clickering and collecting their legs, \nwings, keeping position in the sky and on the earth.
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=More of them horde on the edge of the mist in a ghostly rank.

~01~~panel_010~1_narration=Knowingness dawns. Tilts one weird head, then the next.\nIt's the Thrixl equivalent of a sigh.
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=Not audible, but visible in the way their forms relax and expand. The rigidity of purpose fades.
~01~~panel_011~2_narration=And as one, they turn from the tower's face.
~01~~panel_011~3_narration=Back towards their own place, perhaps, they go.
