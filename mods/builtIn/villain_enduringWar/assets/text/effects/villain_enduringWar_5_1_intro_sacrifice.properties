~01~~panel_001~1_none=The Factory was supposed to be our life's work.
~01~~panel_002~1_none=But <npc2> traded that life for something… horrifying.
~01~~panel_003~1_none=[large]And I [b][i]won't[][] let it spread.
~01~~panel_003~2_actionSmall=*click*
~01~~panel_003~3_actionSmall=[green]ff
~01~~panel_003~4_action=[green]ffFFFZ
~01~~panel_003~5_actionLarge=[green]ZHH...
~01~~panel_004~1_none=A Morthagi never misunderstands.
~01~~panel_005~1_none=Never decides it knows better than you.
~01~~panel_006~1_none=Morthagi are the only ones I can trust to carry out this mission...
~01~~panel_006~2_action=[green]ZZZHHHHH...[]
~01~~panel_007~1_none=...long after I'm gone.
~01~~panel_007~2_actionSmall=[green]vvvvmmm...[]
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=The mountain shadowing <site> erupts,
~01~~panel_009~2_narration=bleeding drills and blades,
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=legs that are not entirely legs,
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=And blank, empty rage.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=They seep and spill through the Yondering hills…
~01~~panel_012~1_coward=No.
~01~~panel_013~1_ship=No?
~01~~panel_014~1_coward=We sacrificed <volunteer>.
~01~~panel_014~2_coward=<coward.familyWith.volunteer: Everyone came around afterwards, dribbling platitudes about “sacrifice.” Nothing but <coward.poet/romantic/bookish/hothead/goofball/snark/greedy/80:hot air/hot air/hot air/hog crap/hog crap/hog crap/hog crap/nonsense>... I lost my family. They didn’t.\n/\n<coward.rfln.volunteer:I always secretly thought I’d be glad if <volunteer.mf:he/she/they> left, but I still think about that day and feel queasy./\nI tried to go visit <volunteer.mf:him/her/them>, but I barely get anything out of those machines. It’s not <volunteer.mf:him/her/them> anymore./\nEveryone came around afterwards, dribbling platitudes about “sacrifice.” Nothing but <coward.poet/romantic/bookish/hothead/goofball/snark/greedy/80:hot air/hot air/hot air/hog crap/hog crap/hog crap/hog crap/nonsense>... I lost my <volunteer>. They didn’t./\nThe whole transaction still makes me queasy when I think about it, even years later.>>
~01~~panel_015~1_coward=I’m not sure if it was better or worse than a regular death.
~01~~panel_016~1_coward=And then we get news that it didn’t fix the problem?
~01~~panel_017~1_coward=<coward.coward/hothead/greedy/loner/snark/80:[face:scared]/[face:rage]/[face:angry]/[face:angry]/[face:angry]/[face:interested]>Maybe made it [i]worse?[]
~01~~panel_018~1_coward=<coward.goofball/snark/poet/romantic/bookish/leader/healer/hothead/greedy/coward/loner:\nI may be a fool, but I’m not an idiot. I can see when it’s time to back off./\n[face:angry]So we hippity-hop back out there and go, “Oh, but [i]this[] time is different!” Really?/\nWe build our little anthills and chisel at mountains and feel busy./\nHeroism is well and good, but… <ship>, there has to be a limit./\nThere comes a time when you need to do the calculations and cut your losses./\nMaybe we’ve failed. I’m sorry. I’ll put it on my shoulders if you like./\nMaybe damage control is the best use of our time now. We try to save who we can./\n[face:angry]This whole stupid thing is a waste of my time./\nWe have to take care of ourselves at this point./\nI can’t do this anymore. I just can’t./\nI don’t have this in me.>
~01~~panel_019~1_coward=We could… ride this out. Somewhere.
~01~~panel_021~1_ship=Alright. Fine.
~01~~panel_022~1_ship=I’ll tell everyone else that <coward> <coward.bookish/greedy/coward/loner/healer/snark/goofball/hothead/leader/romantic/poet:did the “calculations” and decided not to join us./has other things <coward.mf:he/she/they> wants to do and won’t be joining us./finally dropped out and won’t be joining us./finally dropped out and won’t be joining us./was too hopeless to join us./was too grumpy to join us./was too grumpy to join the rest of the idiots./was too grumpy to join us in our wasting of time./was too melancholy to join us. <coward.mf:He/She/They> said <coward.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> take credit for any failures, though./reached <coward.mf:his/her/their> "heroism limit" and won't be joining us./was too fatalistic to join the rest of us ants.>
~01~~panel_023~1_ship=Except for you. But <ship.hothead/goofball/greedy/snark/loner/healer/bookish/poet/80:I get it./I get it./I get it./I get it./I get it./[face:interested]it’s okay./[face:interested]I sympathize./[face:interested]I sympathize./that’s fine.>
~01~~panel_024~1_coward=Wait…. Everyone else is on board?
~01~~panel_025~1_ship=It’s a lot of pressure.
~01~~panel_029~1_actionSmall=*puff*
~01~~panel_030~1_coward=Fine. What's the plan.
~01~~panel_031~1_ship=First, we go convince <hero3> to join us.<hero4.exists: Next, the rest./>
~01~~panel_031~2_ship=Then, we storm the mountain and end this war.
~01~~panel_032~1_coward=<hero3>? But you had said—
~01~~panel_033~1_ship=Mmm, too late to back out now.
~01~~panel_034~1_ship=You’d have to walk… sheesh, a [i]whole mile[] back to your house.
~01~~panel_034~2_ship=Nah, you’re committed.
