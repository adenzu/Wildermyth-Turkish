~01~~panel_003.(deadHero_exists)~1_npc=But wait, where's...?
~01~~panel_005.(deadHero_exists)~1_npc=I see.
~01~~panel_006.(deadHero_exists)~1_hero=They’ll get a proper burial. That hellhole is a graveyard for machines now, not for people.
~01~~panel_007.(deadHero_exists)~1_hero=But at least it's over.
~01~~panel_008.(deadHero_exists)~1_npc=So you pulled it off, then. Good. We can rest for a bit.
~01~~panel_009.(deadHero_is_missing)~1_hero=Oof.

~01~~panel_010.(deadHero_is_missing)~2_npc=How did things shake out?
~01~~panel_011.(deadHero_is_missing)~1_hero=They've been disassembled.
~01~~panel_011.(deadHero_is_missing)~2_hero2=That's a polite way of putting it.
~01~~panel_011.(deadHero_is_missing)~3_hero=We'll melt down what we can.
~01~~panel_012.(deadHero_is_missing)~1_npc=So you pulled it off, then. Good. We can rest for a bit.

~01~~panel_013~2_hero=Nothing's crawling out of there again.
~01~~panel_014~1_npc=This workshop was not the only one ever in operation.
~01~~panel_015~1_warrior=And Morthagi’s ability to lie dormant and bide their time is one of their greatest strengths.
~01~~panel_016~1_npc=I hope I’m wrong. But in case I’m not, and in case I’m not around to help next time…
~01~~panel_017~1_hero=<hero.goofball/snark/80:What, planning on going somewhere?/What, planning on going somewhere?/"Not around?">
~01~~panel_019~1_npc=...It’s a thing you have to consider when you reach my age.
~01~~panel_020~1_npc=In case I'm not...
~01~~panel_020~2_npc=Keep your wits about you.
