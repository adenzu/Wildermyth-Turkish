~01~prompt~panel_006~1_darken=It's still intact. I can't believe it.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_volunteer=...That looks important.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_darken=The Heart was made to give spirit to our own soldiers.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hero=Sounds useful. Is there a button somewhere or...?
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_darken=Ah. Well. To work, it needs a willing person to fuse their soul to it.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_darken=Without that, the Morthagi have been able to use our own constructs against us for centuries.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_volunteer=But… if you had a willing soul?
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_darken=The constructs would become agents of the Heart.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_volunteer=Sounds like that would make this fight considerably easier.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_darken=With the base under our control, we could be much more helpful in the fight against the Morthagi as well.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hero=But that’s not… it’s not like [i]inter-[]fusion, right?
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_darken=The fusion is permanent.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_hero=Eugh.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_darken=The upside, however, is something akin to immortality.
