.name=Chapter Kickoff
~01~~panel_001~1_npc2=Look at these things. They’re beautiful in their own way, but they’re not people. They were never meant to be.
~01~~panel_002~1_npc2=And you think you can stick your soul into one, and whatever comes out the other end will still be you?
~01~~panel_003~1_npc3=What’s the alternative? Death?
~01~~panel_004~1_npc2=If it comes to that, yes!
~01~~panel_004~2_npc2=Because having some abomination following me around, insisting it was you? For eternity?
~01~~panel_004~3_npc2=That’s worse torture than any honest loss.
~01~~panel_005~1_npc3=“Honest?” You’re being selfish.
~01~~panel_005~2_npc3=You can’t see beyond your own conception of what a person is. This could usher in a new era of humanity, and—
~01~~panel_006~1_npc2=[darkRed][i]It wouldn’t [b]BE[] humanity![]
~01~~panel_008~1_npc3=I’ll change your mind.
~01~~panel_009~1_npc3=I shouldn’t [i]have[] to.
~01~~panel_009~2_npc3=But because I apparently care about you, [small]for whatever reason I can’t remember at the moment…[]
~01~~panel_010~1_npc2=<npc3>, where are you going?
~01~~panel_011~1_action=Come back!
~01~~panel_014~1_darken=I want you to know that just by coming here, I’ve put your land at risk.
~01~~panel_015~1_darken=The Morthagi erupt when they catch wind of any of us.
~01~~panel_015~2_npc=Well then, I won’t waste your time. I’ll just ask directly.
~01~~panel_015~3_npc=Can you make me into one of you?
~01~~panel_016~1_npc=I’ve built most of a body based on my studies of your late friend. But I need your help to finish the job.
~01~~panel_019~1_npc=I’m a skilled metalworker and was a decent fighter in my younger days as well.
~01~~panel_020~1_npc=I know I can be an asset to you and your people.
~01~~panel_021~1_darken=No one has called us “people” in a long time.
~01~~panel_022~1_darken=...Are you certain? It’s not a safeguard against death, you’ve seen that firsthand.
~01~~panel_023~1_npc=I don’t need a safeguard, I just need a way to halt my own [i]decay.[]
~01~~panel_023~2_npc=How old were you when you became Enduring?
~01~~panel_025~1_npc=...As old as me?
~01~~panel_026~1_darken=No.
~01~~panel_026~2_npc=Then you don’t know what it’s like. Nobody does, until they get here.
~01~~panel_027~1_speech=You grow up thinking your elders just [i]like[] complaining about their aches and weariness. You think they [i]like[] sitting in the same chair day after day watching clouds pass.
~01~~panel_027~2_speech=You don’t realize that they do it because anything more has become impossible.
~01~~panel_028~1_npc=I don’t want to reach that point if there’s a better way.
~01~~panel_029~1_darken=...A better way.
~01~~panel_030~1_darken=Then you have understood where others have not.
~01~~panel_030~2_darken=It feels good to have someone understand.
~01~~panel_031~1_darken=Come with me. We’ll make our best effort.
~01~~panel_033~1_narration=A reasonable amount of time later...
~01~~panel_035~1_leader=I’ve been talking with the carpenter from <town>.
~01~~panel_036~1_leader=They’re getting overwhelmed with people driven out of the surrounding regions by the Morthagi.
~01~~panel_037~1_leader=<company> needs to help.
~01~~panel_038~1_coward=I assume you don’t mean helping them build houses.
~01~~panel_039~1_leader=<leader.healer/coward/loner/goofball/snark/hothead/80:\n[face:interested]I wish. Wouldn’t that be nice?/\n[face:interested]I wish. Wouldn’t that be nice?/\n[face:skeptical]I wish. Wouldn’t that be nice?/\n[face:joke]Ha! Nope. Way more violent./\n[face:dubious]Ha! Nope. Way more violent./\n[face:talking]Ha! Nope. Way more violent./\n[face:skeptical]As wholesome as that sounds, no.>
