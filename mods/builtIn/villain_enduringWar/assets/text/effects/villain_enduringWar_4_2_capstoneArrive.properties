~01~~panel_001~1_poet=I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but I am.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=If you knew what you were looking for, the "split boulder" north of <site> wasn't difficult to find.
~01~~panel_004~1_poet=The sunlight.
~01~~panel_005~1_leader=Hm?

~01~~panel_009~1_darken=Psst...
~01~~panel_011~1_darken=Stop! Put your weapons down, it’s me.

~01~~panel_013~1_darken=This will take longer to explain than we can afford.
~01~~panel_013~2_darken=Would you like the short version or the extremely short version?
~01~~panel_014~1_leader=Short's probably—
~01~~panel_015~1_snark=[i]Extremely[] short, please.
~01~~panel_016~1_darken=Well. It turns out that you can put a human soul into a specialized Morthagi body.
~01~~panel_016~2_darken=The combination of mechanism and magic is novel in that—
~01~~panel_017~1_snark=[i]Extremely. Short.[]
~01~~panel_018~1_darken=<npc2> here, <npc2.mf:he's/she's/they've> kept an enclave of these folks ticking for a long time.
~01~~panel_018~2_darken=But due to a… er...
~01~~panel_019~1_darken=Disagreement.
~01~~panel_020~1_darken=...at the beginning of <npc2.mf:his/her/their> endeavor...
~01~~panel_021~1_darken=...the Morthagi you are familiar with have been created with the singular mission of destroying them.
~01~~panel_021~2_darken="Us," now, I suppose.
~01~~panel_022~1_darken=They’ve been relentless in hunting us down, denying us resources.
~01~~panel_023~1_leader=To the point of destroying entire towns?
~01~~panel_025~1_darken=But if we can take back our stronghold here, we can deal them a great blow.
~01~~panel_026~1_darken=Let us lead you to the Heartroom, and I’ll explain further.
~01~~panel_027~1_darken=We are not beings of war ourselves, but if you can cut down Morthagi along the way...
~01~~panel_027~2_actionSmall=[gray]*clanck*
~01~~panel_028~1_darken=I can lock the doors once we get there to buy us some time.
~01~~panel_028~2_actionSmall=[green]*chh-Thunk*
~01~~panel_028~3_actionSmall=[gold]Kzrrrr...
~01~~panel_029~1_darken=We won't be able to clear all of them out at first. Focus on moving forward.
