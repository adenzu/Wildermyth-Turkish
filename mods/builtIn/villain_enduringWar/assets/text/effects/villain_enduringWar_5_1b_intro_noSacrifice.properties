~01~~panel_001~1_none=The Factory was supposed to be our life's work.
~01~~panel_002~1_none=But <npc2> traded that life for something… horrifying.
~01~~panel_003~1_none=[large]And I [b][i]won't[][] let it spread.
~01~~panel_003~2_actionSmall=*click*
~01~~panel_003~3_actionSmall=[green]ff
~01~~panel_003~4_action=[green]ffFFFZ
~01~~panel_003~5_actionLarge=[green]ZHH...
~01~~panel_004~1_none=A Morthagi never misunderstands.
~01~~panel_005~1_none=Never decides it knows better than you.
~01~~panel_006~1_none=Morthagi are the only ones I can trust to carry out this mission...
~01~~panel_006~2_action=[green]ZZZHHHHH...[]
~01~~panel_007~1_none=...long after I'm gone.
~01~~panel_007~2_actionSmall=[green]vvvvmmm...[]
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=The mountain shadowing <site> erupts,
~01~~panel_009~2_narration=bleeding drills and blades,
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=legs that are not entirely legs,
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=And blank, empty rage.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=They seep and spill through the Yondering hills…
~01~~panel_012~1_hothead=<hothead.coward/hothead/greedy/snark/80:[face:scared]/[face:angry]/[face:angry]/[face:angry]/[face:surprised]>[i]What?!
~01~~panel_013~1_hothead=<hothead.coward/hothead/greedy/snark/80:[face:scared]/[face:angry]/[face:angry]/[face:angry]/[face:surprised]>...So then we get news that our efforts didn’t fix this? Maybe made it [i]worse?[]
~01~~panel_013~2_healer=We don’t have a lot of other options at this point. We have to do what we can.
~01~~panel_015~1_hothead=Maybe we do have options, though.
~01~~panel_016~1_hothead=Listen. The Morthagi want these "Enduring" dead, right?
~01~~panel_017~1_speech=Once that’s achieved, they’ll stop disassembling our whole blasted civilization.
~01~~panel_018~1_hothead=They’ll go back into the earth, or wherever they go.
~01~~panel_019~1_hothead=I’m saying, there are a lot fewer of those Enduring, and if we could take [i]them[] out...
~01~~panel_020~1_healer=What? If we can help the Enduring fight the Morthagi, we should. They haven’t hurt anybody!
~01~~panel_021~1_hothead=They haven’t?
~01~~panel_022~1_hothead=What it sounds like to me is that they want immortality.
~01~~panel_023~1_speech=And to maintain it, they don’t care how many towns have to be destroyed or other people be killed.
~01~~panel_024~1_hothead=<healer.healer/bookish/poet/romantic/leader/hothead/80:Sorry if it offends your sensibilities/Sorry if it offends your sensibilities/Sorry if it offends your sensibilities/Sorry if it offends your sensibilities/You think you’re taking the high road here/You think you’re taking the high road here/Maybe it’s not the most pleasant way>, but don’t we owe our homeland the best chance at peace?
