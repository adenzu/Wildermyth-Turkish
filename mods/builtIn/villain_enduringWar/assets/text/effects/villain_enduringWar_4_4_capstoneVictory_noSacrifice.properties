~01~~panel_001~1_darken=The demise of the Morthagi here is a boon to your kind and ours. We appreciate you taking the risks of battle.
~01~~panel_002~1_hero=Like you said, it’s a win for us both.
~01~~panel_003.(deadHero_exists)~1_hero=Even if the price is steep.
~01~~panel_004.(deadHero_exists)~1_hero=We have suffered many losses as well. We mourn with you.
~01~~panel_005~1_hero=Well, the base is yours to do with as you like.
~01~~panel_006~1_hero=...Just don’t go rampaging the countryside, right?
~01~~panel_007~1_darken=We strive only to defend ourselves.
~01~~panel_008~1_poet=And the day may come again when we have to, but with this haven, we’ll be prepared.
~01~~panel_009~1_poet=So <company> said tired goodbyes to <npc> and the other Enduring and returned to the world of warm winds and cricket chirps.
~01~~panel_009~2_hero=...And food. Can’t wait to get back to places where people eat food.
