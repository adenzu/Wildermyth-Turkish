.name=How It Began...
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_mystic=[white]One thousand years earlier...
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_mystic=[brown][actionSmall]<npc>,[]\n\nThe initial limbs were a success, and I am confident the premise is sound.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_mystic=[lightYellow]The thought of that sickness taking you first is too much to bear.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_npc=[lightYellow]We can ride this out together.\n\n               We can [green]endure.[]
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc=<npc2>, you can't be serious.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_actionSmall=*click*
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_action=There were things they told us of.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_warrior=Things [green]without souls[] that walk in forgotten places,
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_warrior=following orders from centuries ago.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_warrior=[green]"Don't linger in caves."
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_warrior=[gray]"Don't delve too deep."
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_warrior="Could be Morthagi down there."
~01~prompt~panel_011.(warrior_is_Bookish)~1_warrior=I sometimes built little figures out of clock pieces and wondered...
~01~prompt~panel_012.(warrior_is_Coward)~1_warrior=Didn’t have to tell me twice.
~01~prompt~panel_013.(warrior_is_Goofball)~1_warrior=I always imagined them as big clocks with legs, and it seemed kind of silly.
~01~prompt~panel_014.(warrior_is_Greedy)~1_warrior=What were they doing down there, I wondered. Who did they answer to?
~01~prompt~panel_015.(warrior_is_Healer)~1_warrior=I sometimes spoke kind words to the millstones and clocks, in case they got any ideas.
~01~prompt~panel_016.(warrior_is_Hothead)~1_warrior=I went looking for them once or twice. Never found any.
~01~prompt~panel_017.(warrior_is_Leader)~1_warrior=A friend of mine went down anyway once. I was furious with <warrior.awm:him,her>.
~01~prompt~panel_018.(warrior_is_Loner)~1_warrior=The warnings worked. Otherwise I might have spent even more time in caves.
~01~prompt~panel_019.(warrior_is_Poet)~1_warrior=Perhaps they were the story that let people channel their fear of eternity, of what would come to pass after their own deaths.
~01~prompt~panel_020.(warrior_is_Romantic)~1_warrior=Other legends, like the Lady of Screams, they were intriguing. Beautiful, even. But something like that...
~01~prompt~panel_021.(warrior_is_Snark)~1_warrior=...Eh, I guess it’s no weirder than any other tale parents come up with.
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_mystic=Huh. "Nightjaw" was always our go-to threat growing up. Now [i]that[] was a monster.
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_action=[white]And things in the dark \n[darkGray]can be left unseen,
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_action=[brown]*crrooaarrk*
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_action=[white]until suddenly...
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_action=[white]they [darkRed]can't.
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_darken=[large]RUN.
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_action=[white]*crash*
~01~prompt~panel_029~2_action=[tan]*thump*
~01~prompt~panel_031.(warrior_is_bookish)~1_warrior=I've never seen anything that moved like that. The gait was almost a combination of-
~01~prompt~panel_032.(warrior_is_coward)~1_warrior="Run?"
~01~prompt~panel_033.(warrior_is_loner)~1_warrior="Run?"
~01~prompt~panel_034.(warrior_is_greedy)~1_warrior=So should we... go after it?
~01~prompt~panel_035.(warrior_is_snark)~1_warrior=Well [i]that[] wasn't ominous at all.
~01~prompt~panel_036.(warrior_is_goofball)~1_warrior=<hunter>, your <hunter.awm:girlfriend,boyfriend> is totally out of control.
~01~prompt~panel_037.(warrior_is_leader)~1_warrior=Don't let it get away!
~01~prompt~panel_038.(warrior_is_hothead)~1_warrior=Don't let it get away!
~01~prompt~panel_039.(warrior_NOT_bookish/coward/loner/greedy/snark/..._(80))~1_warrior=What the... what [i]was[] that?
