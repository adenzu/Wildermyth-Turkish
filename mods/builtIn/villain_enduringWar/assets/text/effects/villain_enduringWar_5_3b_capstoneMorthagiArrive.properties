.longName=Stemming the Tide
.name=Event
~01~~panel_001~1_darken=I had been prepared to pay a price for the form I took. A price of flesh and breath.
~01~~panel_002~1_ship=But it cost more than that. It cost peace.
~01~~panel_003~1_darken=It cost the person I loved most.
~01~~panel_003~2_darken=And though <npc2> and I never spoke again...
~01~~panel_004~1_darken=...Perhaps the rest of this can still be put right.
~01~~panel_005~1_party=In the days when the flood of Morthagi had slowed to a trickle, <hunter> was able to locate openings in the cliffs.
~01~~panel_006~1_hook=I’ve seen a lot of things in my life,
~01~~panel_007~1_speech=...but this is a whole new <hook.bookish/poet/romantic/80:scale/manner/manner/sort> of thing.
~01~~panel_009.(hero_is_Bookish)~1_hero3=Any fun facts about Morthagi to take the edge off of this place?
~01~~panel_010.(hero_is_Bookish)~1_hero=Nothing that wouldn’t creep you out even further.
~01~~panel_011.(hero_is_Coward)~1_hero3=Don’t take this the wrong way, but I half expected you to sit this one out.
~01~~panel_012.(hero_is_Coward)~1_hero=There’s one thing that's worse than Morthagi, and that’d be having to live with myself if I did.
~01~~panel_013.(hero_is_Goofball)~1_hero3=I could use a bit of lighthearted banter right now.
~01~~panel_014.(hero_is_Goofball)~1_hero=I got nothin’. The weight of this place squeezes all the light out of you.
~01~~panel_015.(hero_is_Greedy)~1_hero3=What do you think we’ll find in here?
~01~~panel_016.(hero_is_Greedy)~1_hero=I don’t know, and for once, I don’t particularly care to.
~01~~panel_017.(hero_is_Healer)~1_hero3=Any comforting thoughts?
~01~~panel_018.(hero_is_Healer)~1_hero=I don’t know… the weight of this place squeezes all the comfort out of you.
~01~~panel_019.(hero_is_Hothead)~1_hero3=You feeling ready?
~01~~panel_020.(hero_is_Hothead)~1_hero=Eh. It’s better than staying home and baking in my own anger. But just barely.
~01~~panel_021.(hero_is_Leader)~1_hero3=I’m taking my cues from you, you know that, right?
~01~~panel_022.(hero_is_Leader)~1_hero=I wish I could say that was a wise idea, but...
~01~~panel_023.(hero_is_Loner)~1_hero3=It's not your average mountain... tunnel-fortress sort of place, is it?
~01~~panel_024.(hero_is_Loner)~1_hero=This isn’t just a place. It watches you. One could never be alone here.
~01~~panel_025.(hero_is_Poet)~1_hero3=I could use some perspective right about now, <hero>.
~01~~panel_026.(hero_is_Poet)~1_hero=...I’ve lost my bearings. We’re no longer in a world made for people—this is something else’s turf.
~01~~panel_027.(hero_is_Romantic)~1_hero=Those pipes…
~01~~panel_028.(hero_is_Romantic)~1_hero=...the fact that they’re almost beautiful makes them all the more unnerving.
~01~~panel_029.(hero_is_Snark)~1_hero=Listen. I have something important to get off my chest. In case we don’t make it.
~01~~panel_031.(hero_is_Snark)~1_hero=I'm the one...
~01~~panel_032.(hero_is_Snark)~1_hero=...who’s been stealing your jerky.
~01~~panel_033.(hero_is_Snark)~1_hero3=*sigh*
~01~~panel_034.(hero_is_Snark)~1_hero3=Oh, <hero>.
~01~~panel_034.(hero_is_Snark)~2_hero3=I knew.
~01~~panel_035~1_action=With [aqua]stone[] and [gray]iron[] and [tan]bone[] closing in...
~01~~panel_035~2_actionSmall=[green]*skrrrrkk*
~01~~panel_035~3_actionSmall=[gray]*KZHT*
~01~~panel_036~1_action=it can feel unlucky to be made of [gold]softer things.
~01~~panel_037~1_action=[white]But we have strength \n     of our own...
~01~~panel_038~1_action=...which should not be underestimated.

~01~~panel_038~3_actionSmall=[gray]*ZHRRT*
