~01~~panel_001~1_npc2=<npc3>! You’re back! I was so worried.
~01~~panel_002~1_npc2=When you wrote about that horrible immortal-mechanical nonsense, I was afraid you’d lost your mind.
~01~~panel_003~1_npc3=Nonsense? I’m completely serious.
~01~~panel_005~1_npc3=Why are you making that face?
~01~~panel_006~1_npc3=There’s a plague out there, I’m telling you I’ve found a way for us to [i]bypass death[], and you’re making that face?
~01~~panel_007~1_npc2=You can’t bypass death.
~01~~panel_008~1_npc2=What you’re talking about, that’s something else. Something… unnatural. Abominable.
~01~~panel_011~1_npc3=The Morthagi have always been tools. We’ve used them to achieve countless other things.
~01~~panel_012~1_action=So \n  why\n    not [green]\n      this?..
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=<healer> had visited <npc> a few times.
~01~~panel_014~2_narration=They picked apart Morthagi elbows and <healer.poet/romantic/bookish/greedy/healer/coward/goofball/snark/80:debated the nature of consciousness/made up stories about the ancient Mortificers/debated the nature of consciousness/priced out their various metals/swapped childhood stories/stitched up old insecurities/gossiped about the rest of the company/gossiped about the rest of the company/told tales of old battles> over jugs of wine.
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=They dug into the body of the strange Morthagi as well, but <npc> remained puzzled as to how it worked.
~01~~panel_016~1_narration=So when <healer> received an urgent invitation to the forge, <healer.mf:he/she/they> set off immediately.
~01~~panel_017~1_npc=Thank you. Listen.
~01~~panel_018~1_npc=I have very important, potentially dangerous information.
~01~~panel_019~1_npc=I knew I had to share it with you.
~01~~panel_019~2_healer=Of course.
~01~~panel_020~1_healer=You might even say I’m honored, to be the person that you’d come to…
~01~~panel_021~1_healer=...first.
~01~~panel_021~2_goofball=<goofball.rfln.healer:\n[face:skeptical]Oh. You invited <healer>?/\n[face:talking]Hey, <healer>! ‘Bout time, we’ve been waiting for you./\n[face:talking]Oh good, I was afraid I was going to have to go get you!/\n[face:talking]Hey, <healer>! ‘Bout time, we’ve been waiting for you.>
~01~~panel_023~1_npc=I’d start with pleasantries, but there’s nothing pleasant about this.
~01~~panel_024~1_speech=A wave of Morthagi has been moving across the countryside.
~01~~panel_025~1_speech=A little further out, closer to <town>, but causing just as much destruction. Based on the way they’re spreading, it seems like they originated in <overlandTile>.
~01~~panel_026~1_goofball=I’ve had some amazing cheeses from there.
~01~~panel_027~1_healer=<goofball.rfln.healer:\n[face:dubious]Oh well then, by all means, if the [i]cheese[] is threatened./\nWell, if we weren’t motivated by duty or glory before, now we can add cheese to the list./\n[face:happy]We’ll pick some up for you after we deal with the Morthagi, eh?/\n[face:interested]Well, if we weren’t motivated by duty or glory before, now we can add cheese to the list.>
~01~~panel_028~1_npc=There are almost certainly some of the old Mortificers’ workshops there, and I wouldn’t be surprised if—
~01~~panel_029~1_goofball=Mortificers are still around?
~01~~panel_030~1_npc=No. But their workshops are, and some Morthagi can manufacture more of themselves without a person overseeing the process.
~01~~panel_030~2_healer=<healer.snark/goofball/coward/leader/bookish/80:[face:dubious]Oh, great./[face:skeptical]Swell./[face:interested]Yikes./[face:skeptical]Good to know./Fascinating./>
~01~~panel_031~1_healer=So...<company> sets out again.
~01~~panel_031~2_bookish=<bookish.bookish/greedy/romantic/coward/loner/snark/hothead/goofball/80:\n[face:dubious]Sigh. I was almost all the way through organizing the library, too./\n[face:dubious]Sigh. My candle-making business was just getting off the ground, too./\n[face:dubious]Sigh. This <bookish.awm:gorgeous squash-gardener/brawny baker-type> had [i]just[] moved in next door, too./\n[face:interested]Okay. Though I might need some time to… you know. Switch mindsets here./\n[face:dubious]Sigh. The neighbor with the rooster had [i]just[] moved out. It was finally quiet.../\n[face:dubious]Sigh. The neighbor with the rooster had [i]just[] moved out. It was finally quiet.../\n[face:interested]Wow. I’m actually excited. ...Am I allowed to say that?/\n[face:skeptical]I can leave tomorrow. Just gotta get someone to take the goats…/\n[face:grim]Right. Every day we wait...>
~01~~panel_032~1_npc=I’m finishing up a better weapon, but I’ll try to meet you at <site3>.
~01~~panel_033~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/greedy/romantic/coward/loner/snark/hothead/goofball/80:\n[face:interested]Sorry, botany-shelf. You’ll remain a mess for the time being.../\n[face:skeptical]Maybe the mason would manage it for a cut of the profits.../\n[face:skeptical]Maybe I’ll have some tales to tell <bookish.awm:her,him> later.../\n[face:grim]I didn’t want to have to remember where I packed away that weapon.../\n[face:dubious]I’d slept in for three mornings in a row and it was fantastic.../\n[face:dubious]I’d slept in for three mornings in a row and it was fantastic.../\n[face:joke]Oh man, got those itchy-fists again.../\n[face:happy]I bet the lumber guy’ll take them, he probably doesn’t hate goats too much.../\n[face:grim]I had a feeling this would happen…>
~01~~panel_035~1_healer=Any insights?
~01~~panel_035~2_npc=No.
~01~~panel_036~1_npc=It’s standard in some ways. But then the core of it is bizarre. Something complicated is going on here, but I can’t figure out exactly what.
~01~~panel_037~1_healer=Huh.
~01~~panel_040~1_darken=Excuse me.
~01~~panel_042~1_darken=You have the body of my friend in there.
~01~~panel_043~1_darken=You've kept it in decent condition.
~01~~panel_043~2_npc=I appreciate that.
~01~~panel_045~1_darken=Apologies. This must be strange.
~01~~panel_045~2_npc=Not at all.
~01~~panel_046~1_npc=Er, that is... Yes. It is strange.
~01~~panel_047~1_speech=But I have many questions for you.
