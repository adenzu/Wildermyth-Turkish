~01~~panel_003~4_narration=Daylight lands on <mystic.mf:his/her/their> wrist. \nCool wind soothes <mystic.mf:his/her/their> tired eyes.

~01~~panel_005~2_narration=<mystic.mf:He closes/She closes/They close> the tower door.\nGentle, to make no noise.
~01~~panel_005~3_action=[gray][actionSmall]...clup...
~01~~panel_006~4_mystic=That was the [i]mystic's art,[] that I did. Right, tower? \nWhere'd I get it from. Could it've just... happened?
~01~~panel_007~4_mystic=Is it just one of those things?
~01~~panel_008~5_speech=[small]<mystic>?!
~01~~panel_009~4_mystic=Things a <mystic.mf:man/woman/person>'s born with, that might blossom in <mystic.mf:his/her/their> life when <mystic.mf:he needs/she needs/they need> them? <mystic.personality:That's the illogic of stories, it can't... truly explain anything. I need to get back to the library./Only a story's supposed to work that way, and not for someone like me./[face:happy]People would be so mad at me. But fortune likes a smile, they say./[face:skeptical]Well, I might not deserve it, but you never turn down a turkey. So they say./I suppose, wherever it's from, all I can do is have gratitude. And use it wisely./[face:happy]Well, wherever it came from, no one'll want to mess with me now./Maybe I can't know. But I can already feel the responsibility.[face:grim]/Suddenly I could listen to the bookcase. Talk to the flame. I feel the sweetness in that onionplant./Suddenly I could listen to the bookcase. Talk to the flame. I feel the sweetness in that onionplant./Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.

~01~~panel_010~1_hunter=<mystic>! <hunter.rfln.mystic:You, bunkhead![face:grim]/You alright, there?/[face:surprised]You're okay! You're okay? You look like it.../--->
~01~~panel_011~1_mystic=<mystic.personality2:Are there books on this? Perhaps that's the first order of doing, is to gather a little knowledge.../Although, does this power mean...? Or, do I have to do anything with it?[face:skeptical] Is it better if I [b]don't[]?/I don't suppose I can get folks \nto call me a wizzerd.[face:happy]/Need to figure out what all I can [b]do[] with this power. How to use it well./It'll be useful if I figure it out, of course.\nHopefully I'm not endangering anything./But what does this power mean? Am I a legend like old <npc.fullname>? Do I have to go reconfigure rivers?[face:skeptical]/Of course, this means I've got some new responsibilities, suddenly. First one's maybe to figure out my limits./[face:neutral]I should plumb the depths of this power. But safely, I suppose. And out of sight./Maybe in starlight, I'll understand it deeper.[face:neutral] /[face:happy]I guess one thing this means... is that I'm now a charming enigma. A mysterious <mystic.mf:enchanter/enchantress/enchanter>. Born ordinary, but [b]changed[] by things <mystic.mf:his/her/their> young, captivating eyes have seen.../But... am I a bedtime story, now? Am I going to \nfind a talking animal who gives me a quest?[face:happy]>
