~01~~panel_001~2_action=[white]The mighty Ulstryx finally crumpled before us.\n      His reeking corpse twitched still.
~01~~panel_001~3_action=[white]It was over.
~01~~panel_002~2_action=[white]Some would say we saved the world.
~01~~panel_002~3_volunteer2=<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]/[face:happy]>
~01~~panel_003~2_action=[maroon]And we did save the ember of it.
~01~~panel_003~3_action=[white] We cupped this red coal of life, \nheld it away from the water.\n\nCarried it into the next morning...
~01~~panel_004~1_action=[white]...through wreckage, loss...
~01~~panel_005~2_action=[white]...destruction.
~01~~panel_006~1_action=[white]It would take time...
~01~~panel_006~2_action=[white]...for the water to go down...
~01~~panel_006~3_action=[white]...the memories to lose their bite.
~01~~panel_007~1_action=[actionLarge][tan]To rebuild.
~01~~panel_008~1_action=[maroon][actionLarge]To heal.
~01~~panel_009~1_action=[gol][actionLarge]And maybe to live \n  new lives, someday.
~01~~panel_009~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:sad]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_010~3_action=[gold][actionLarge]But our story \n   was just\none of many.
~01~~panel_011~1_action=[actionSmall]...snrf...
~01~~panel_012~3_action=[header][gold]The End.
