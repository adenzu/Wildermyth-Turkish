~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=The previous night...
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=The tower where <mystic> had arranged to meet <warrior> and <hunter> is a place <mystic.mf:he/she/they> often used to escape to as a <mystic.mf:boy/girl/child> .
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=<mystic.mf:He knows/She knows/They know> its rooms and floors so well...
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_actionSmall=[actionSmall]cough!
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_actionSmall=[actionSmall]cough!
~01~prompt~panel_003~6_narration=...<mystic.mf:he/she/they> could survive being chased through them.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_speech=[small]And now I wait, \nI suppose.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_action=[actionSmall]cough
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_mystic=[actionSmall][light]cough!
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_narration=Dust gets deep as rainpuddles in here.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_mystic=Alive is alive. <mystic.coward/leader/60:Though... better not to be, maybe. If that beast breaks through./Better have a plan if that beast breaks through./Until that beast breaks through.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_mystic=<mystic.personality:You really are a curiosity to me, beast./Beast?[face:interested]/What do you say, beast?/You're a rare beast./Don't you know, beast?/Keep it up, beast.[face:talking]/You don't mean any of this, do you, beast?[face:grim]/You're not so bad, are you, beast?[face:grim]/We stand separated. In space, and in perspective. As the crow and the wolf <mystic.mf:he/she/they> looks down to.[face:neutral]/What do you think, beast?/Well, beast?[face:dubious]>
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_action=[aqua]Snuh-flrk!!!
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_action=[darkAqua]Gwuff!!
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_mystic=<mystic.personality:It's a shame about your attitude./Ah... you're still there...[face:interested]/Even [i]you[][face:skeptical] must be bored./Folks would pay to see you. I'd pay not to.[face:skeptical]/I'm not good eating, anyway./We'll see which of us loses our heads first![face:joy]/You're trapped in whatever sickness... has [i]changed[] you.../At least you're not loud.[face:neutral]/But one of us must kill the other. What can a bird do but caw at you, with <mystic.mf:his/her/their> wings bound?/[face:happy]Will <hunter.rfln.mystic:[i]anyone[] come to my rescue?/my friends swoop in and save me?/<hunter.mf:he/she/they> swoop in and save me?/---> \nOr am I not pretty enough?/[face:skeptical]How are your plans coming along?>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_narration=<random:The tower has outlived generations./The tower is an heirloom of an earlier people. The locals have lost the legend of it./It's a picturesque old tower, perfect for a plot twist.> <random:Weathered and sagging, it defends nothing now. Not even from rain./Maybe the boast of some long-dead despot whose name has sunk in the river./There's an elden dignity in the stones: they stand for standing, though it seems they guard nothing./The emptiness is deep and fragrant, the odor of ten-thousand rains that've soaked into stone./Now it's little more than a strange nest for spiders, owls, and trysting lovers.>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=But as the old will tell you...
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_narration=...precious things go overlooked in a ruin.
~01~prompt~panel_013~3_narration=What lodges amid the bones of failure is often the dream that drove it.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_mystic=That book. Why have I never...?
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_action=[aqua][actionLarge]Gwrf!
~01~prompt~panel_016~3_mystic=[small]Easy there...
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_mystic=I guess you're wondering why I'm talking to myself. Huh, beast?
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_mystic=[small]I'm also wondering...
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_narration=<mystic> bends to pull it loose.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_narration=The book's heavier than its slender spine suggests...
~01~prompt~panel_021~3_mystic=Look at all this...
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_narration=It's full of strange stories.
~01~prompt~panel_022~2_narration=The folklore of folk long forgotten.
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_mystic=<mystic.coward/hothead/leader/loner:The Chained <mystic.mf:Boy/Girl/Child>[face:grim]/The Tyrant's Medicine[face:interested]/Circles of the Ancients/The Candlelight Leaping>...
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_narration=<mystic.coward/hothead/leader/loner:...gives no great insight. It's the uncomfortable story of a <mystic.mf:boy/girl/child> shackled to a rock by <mystic.mf:his/her/their> parents, who sends <mystic.mf:his/her/their> spirit free, moving through the links of the chain that binds <mystic.mf:him/her/them>./...imparts no salient secret. It's only a fairytale about a dying <mystic.mf:emperor/empress/monarch>. <mystic.mf:He swallows/She swallows/They swallow> stars every month to calm <mystic.mf:his/her/their> cancerous anger./...is wild nonsense: how a woodcutter can read the rings inside old trees to find the exact moment a grove began calling itself a forest./...strikes no significant bell. It's the weird story of a child watching candlelight against the ceiling, and wishing <mystic.mf:himself/herself/themself> through it to a far realm without grown-ups.>
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_mystic=<hunter.bookish/goofball/greedy/poet/romantic/loner:Gift of the Enscriptor[face:interested]/The Jester and the Jailer[face:neutral]/[face:talking]The Coinclaw Bear and the Benstrum Fox/Chant of the Soil/The Tears of Oak <mystic.mf:Woman/Man/Person>/[face:neutral]Do You Hear Hidden Fish>...?
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_narration=<hunter.bookish/goofball/greedy/poet/romantic/loner:...proposes an unlikely legend. That one spiderlimbed <mystic.mf:woman/man/person> crafted all written language. <mystic.mf:She/He/They> trapped ants between vellum, and pressed them so long and relentlessly that they became letters./...is the farcical tale of a condemned court jester. <mystic.mf:She convinces/He convinces/They convince> <mystic.mf:her/his/their> guard that the world inside the cell is freedom, and so the dutiful <mystic.mf:guardsman/guardswoman/guard> removes <mystic.mf:her/him/them>./...is mostly a conversation between a miserly bear, and a traveling fox. In the final sentence, the fox stamps the bear's soul into a coin, and sends <mystic.mf:him/her/them> around the world on the current of exchange./…lacks any satisfying action. It's told through the mind of a blind, deaf tea-grower. <mystic.mf:His/Her/Their> nose is so sharp, <mystic.mf:he learns/she learns/they learn> the song of the scented earth, and so <mystic.mf:avoids/avoids/avoid> slaying worms with <mystic.mf:his/her/their> shovel./…is a weird rootless tragedy, of a <mystic.mf:woman/man/person> made of oak who stands on a seacliff and is eaten by termites as <mystic.mf:she waits/he waits/they wait> for <mystic.mf:her/his/their> driftwood love to wash ashore. The flotsam beauty floats forever past the edge of the incoming tide./…has nothing to do with fish. It's the tale of a <mystic.mf:girl/boy/child> burned to glass by lightning and buried. <mystic.mf:She wakes/He wakes/They wake> in the darkness, a fresh young worm, and <mystic.mf:begins her/begins his/begin their> eternal swim through the earth.>

~01~prompt~panel_028~1_narration=<warrior.healer/hothead/leader/poet/snark:...tells of a blight-skinned <mystic.mf:woman/man/person> who drew things so feelingly that they began to come true. And <mystic.mf:she/he/they> drew circles in circles in a book, and eventually fell through./…spins the yarn of a <mystic.mf:mother/father/parent> who drank so much and laughed so freely that <mystic.mf:she/he/they> grew a beautiful spiral horn. <mystic.mf:Her/His/Their> children were very proud./…tells of an assembly of very old people who, instead of dying, take up quilting. They live together, speaking rarely, making magnificent quilts./…claims there once danced a <mystic.mf:woman/man/person> in so many spinning circles that <mystic.mf:she/he/they> stopped moving, and everything else began to turn instead./...says a magician was born who banged solid rings together so stubbornly that they joined. And by this method, <mystic.mf:she/he/they> connected all the stories ever told.>

~01~prompt~panel_030~2_narration=A few blank pages are left.
~01~prompt~panel_031~1_narration=Something in <mystic.mf:him/her/<mystic>> feels like it's coming loose. But <mystic.mf:he/she/they> can't tell exactly [b]what.[]
~01~prompt~panel_032~1_mystic=This book...
~01~prompt~panel_033~1_action=[default][light]I'm stuck here.
~01~prompt~panel_034~1_speech=[light]It's cold.
~01~prompt~panel_035~1_mystic=There's room in it for another story.
~01~prompt~panel_036~4_mystic=<mystic.personality:Very well, then. This must qualify as the beginning./Right, then. I guess... this must be the beginning./Alright. Then I should at least start it serious.../But alright. This is how I'd start it./Right. Then this is the beginning./Yeah, fine. So this is the beginning./This is a warning. But where do I begin?/That'll make this the beginning./Good. Then let this be the beginning./Yes. Then this would be the beginning./Alright, then. So this is how I'll start it.>
~01~prompt~panel_037~1_mystic=Here... in <mystic.loner.60:my/our> Yondering Country...
~01~prompt~panel_037~2_narration=<mystic> writes. Words are ready.
~01~prompt~panel_037~3_narration=Omens have formed in the fabric of everything, and <mystic.mf:he's/she's/they're> beginning to recognize them now.
~01~prompt~panel_038~1_narration=Some are just misgivings. They've crept through <mystic.mf:his/her/their> body like the sourceless aches one wakes with.
~01~prompt~panel_039~1_narration=Others are more substantial.
~01~prompt~panel_039~2_narration=Now they seem lightning-plain. A promise of thunder.
~01~prompt~panel_040~1_action=For in the wild black\n     woods where birds\n        once belled...
~01~prompt~panel_041~1_action=[actionSmall]...a hateful silence...
~01~prompt~panel_042~1_action=[darkAqua][action]...churns.
~01~prompt~panel_043~2_narration=Pain lights <mystic>'s head.
~01~prompt~panel_044~2_narration=Subsides.
~01~prompt~panel_044~4_mystic=I made it to morning?
~01~prompt~panel_045~2_narration=<mystic.mf:He lowers his/She lowers her/They lower their> bleary eyes.
~01~prompt~panel_046~1_narration=<mystic.mf:His/Her/Their> story lies before <mystic.mf:him/her/them> in luminous script. \nEmpty pages have sprouted behind it.
~01~prompt~panel_047~1_mystic=Why do I feel...?
~01~prompt~panel_048~1_actionLarge=[forest]Powerful.

~03~choice_two~panel_001~3_narration=<mystic.mf:He slides/She slides/They slide> a branch from the rubble. \nIt's sturdy. It has a palm-loving twist.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~nameTag_0=Staff
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_mystic=Open wide, beast. I'm getting out of here.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_mystic=Well, beast, it's time. I'm getting out of here.
