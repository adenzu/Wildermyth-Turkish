~01~prompt~panel_001~1_warrior=<warrior.personality:Tactically, is there any information that might be pertinent?[face:skeptical]/We have a plan, right? What's the plan? I just want to know the plan, first./Will you guys get mad if I knock?[face:happy][hunter.face:dubious][mystic.face:dubious] I'm [i]very[] polite./We'll bring back some trophies maybe. Get a little more recognition?[face:skeptical]/Alright, let's talk about how \nwe get through this.[face:grim]/I'm sick of talking. I'm going in. Don't follow me if you're scared.[face:grim]/We fight as a group, we lean a little on our ability to strike at range, maybe. Sound good?[face:talking]/[face:neutral]I'm not the one with the plans./There're many ways to cook an egg. But let's unify our approach, as much as possible./I feel like I do [i]belong[] in the front.

~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=A perfect understanding isn't likely to emerge.
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_narration=What these beasts are, where they came from, what drove them to attack the town of <town>.
~01~prompt~panel_002~4_narration=But letting them nest here feels like the wrong idea.
~01~prompt~panel_002~5_action=[darkAqua][actionSmall]clatter!
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_warrior=<warrior.personality:[face:skeptical]Do we fan out? Get aggressive? Or maximize our defense, stay tight?/[face:interested]That's not a confident face./[face:interested]Wait, were we supposed to be thinking of a [i]plan?[] That's embarrassing./Or do you not think we can win? \nDo we need some brilliant plan?[talking]/[face:interested]Survival's the priority. But is it actually [i]safer[] to be aggressive?/[face:skeptical]Unless you really [i]are[] scared. \nLet's just pick a plan and go with it./[face:neutral]Input's absolutely welcome. It's necessary for us all to feel good about this./[face:neutral]Just do what comes natural?/Who feels confident in their bones? Got a good easy plan?[face:talking]/[face:happy][i]What?[] I'm not wrong, am I?/[face:dubious]We don't have a plan, do we?>
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_mystic=<warrior.romantic.80:Anyway, a plan. Do we have one?/Sure, well...>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hunter=Back at my house, it was pretty simple. \nKill the beast before it kills you.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=+Courage
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=+Stoicism
~03~choice_two~panel_001~3_mystic=I just came out of there. If we're methodical, patient, we can fend them off, at least.
