.blurb=An emissary came to us, in from the elements.
.longName=From Darkness, From Rain
.name=Chapter Kickoff
~01~~panel_001~1_action=Some storms batter compromise\n   into combative neighbors.\n \nGrudges are no shelter \n  in bitter weather.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The rains had been falling for a full week, with brief interludes of tense massing clouds and dripping branches.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Mountain snows melted and water roared from the heights.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=The seas whirled and wrung at the shores, flung waves ever-further.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=Rivers conquered their banks and marched wider.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=Lowland woods and the dams of dry times were swept away...
~01~~panel_005~3_narration=Valleys turned to huge brackish lakes.
~01~~panel_005~4_narration=...as creatures of all shapes and kinds sought escape from churning floods.
~01~~panel_006~1_healer=You think our Ulstryx poisoned the weather? After all this time? Why? How? With what?
~01~~panel_007~1_hook=<hook.bookish/goofball/poet/80:There's no rational explanation for this confluence of catastrophes.../[face:dubious]If the world gets any wetter, it'll dissolve like a whacked meatloaf. You have a theory?/It's beyond nature's whim. Something demands this. A gorgon will.../I'm telling you, it's... well who else could have done this?>
~01~~panel_009~1_hook=<hook.whm:<hook.poet.60:I believe all things are more connected than \nwe th... oh./Nothing's ever made sense about this, \nbut... oh.>/I've seen things in the wild, stuff you can't explain, \nand... oh./I can commune with water. If he can do the same, then perhaps there's... oh.> Someone at the door.
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=They appear to be on edge, here in a \ncommon dwelling... and also very soggy.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=The strange party of visitors begs a fire.
~01~~panel_012~1_healer=Arnon. <healer.hothead/loner/60:You know we're dangerous, right? Why are you here?/You fanatics aren't welcome here. Why'd you come?/You say we're natural allies... Care to explain?>
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=The haggard man behind the horns, calling himself Arnon, takes a long breath, and turns to address <healer> and the rest.
~01~~panel_013~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_014~1_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Ask my wife.
~01~~panel_014~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_016~1_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Ask my wife. She sent me.
~01~~panel_016~2_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Can you believe THAT? At my advanced age?
~01~~panel_016~3_speech=[brown][actionSmall]I grew up here in <town>, you know? It looks different.
~01~~panel_016~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_017~1_narration=His two underlings shift and resettle their garments as they dry out.
~01~~panel_017~2_healer=Must be about the flooding.
~01~~panel_017~3_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Nguh?
~01~~panel_018~1_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Know? Everyone knows! It's those tentaclasts, the Gorgons! They bring ruin on us all!
~01~~panel_018~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_019~1_hook=You know why the--?
~01~~panel_020~2_hook=[i]Which[] Gorgons?
~01~~panel_020~3_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Um, they're blue.
~01~~panel_021~1_healer=That checks out.
~01~~panel_021~2_hook=But I mean, who's their...
~01~~panel_022~1_speech=[brown][actionSmall]The Gorgons are flooding the world! They've set it in motion and it can't be stopped! Almost.
~01~~panel_022~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_023~1_speech=[brown][actionSmall]You're right, it shouldn't be! The great balance should be unassailable...
~01~~panel_023~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_024~1_healer=How? None of this should be possible. I mean, the rain, the melt, the sea...
~01~~panel_025~1_action=[brown]...but somehow they've thrown it over.
~01~~panel_026~1_speech=[brown][actionSmall]So the torrents fall, the seas thrash, \nthe soil seeps black down our warrens...
~01~~panel_027~2_hook=It [i]is[] Ulstryx. I knew it would be...
~01~~panel_027~3_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Ulstritch...? No, it's the Gorgons, I'm saying.
~01~~panel_027~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_028~1_speech=[brown][actionSmall]The beasts have our warren hemmed in. My wife's inside. Dry. And warm. You need to talk to her.
~01~~panel_029~2_hook=Hemmed in, but you slipped by them...?
~01~~panel_029~3_speech=[brown][actionSmall]It's why it had to be me. I'm a master at looping the light. I tend to be missed.
~01~~panel_030~1_speech=[brown][actionSmall]<healer.coward/greedy/healer/hothead/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:I'm here, aren't I? I put myself in your power./Um... I've got some mushtbread? You don't want my dewcheese.../Is it the horns? Trust me, you don't want me to take them off./Huh? Why? I'm Arnon, I'm nice./Your reputation reaches deep. [maroon]YOU[] are the Gorgons' foe./My whiskers might be sly, but my lips are honest. I'm Arnon!/It's not a long or difficult story, is it?/See? Knuckle-face gets it./Why not? I'm Arnon. I'm nice.>
~01~~panel_030~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_031~1_healer=<healer.coward/greedy/healer/hothead/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:Do we have proof you're not going to betray us?/And you have some kind of good faith offering? Or...?/I think we'd like to believe you. But.../You must think we're idiots. Is that it?/My question is... Why come to us?/You speak at a slant, through lying whiskers.../You do sound [i]extremely[] married. I wish there was more of your story I believed./I agree. We [i]should[] follow a fungus-head as the world drowns./And you think we'll trust you?>
~01~~panel_032~1_hook=He... certainly gives us an option. A strange one, but this weather, these floods... what else can we go on?
~01~~panel_033~1_speech=[brown][actionSmall]If you want to watch the world sink beneath a rising sea, watch all landthings perish... then you're exactly where you need to be.
~01~~panel_033~2_speech=[brown][actionSmall] But if you see sense...
~01~~panel_034~1_narration=Arnon thuds a lump of soaked fabric on the table.
~01~~panel_034~2_action=[blue]thlmp!
~01~~panel_035~1_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Here's a, oh. It's [darkBlue]wet[brown].
~01~~panel_035~2_speech=[brown][actionSmall]I mean, it's a map.
~01~~panel_035~3_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Sorry. It'll dry all crinkly.
~01~~panel_036~2_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Follow the map! Come to our warren! There, learn for yourselves how you can deflect this drowning doom, and these lands all-save!
