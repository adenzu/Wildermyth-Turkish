~01~~panel_002~1_action=We knew\nsomething lived\n   inside them.
~01~~panel_003~1_action=Blue burning hate\n [actionSmall]  that frenzied them.\n  Then left them still.
~01~~panel_004~1_action=A stone sentence...\n                 ...worse and more deadly than any venom.

~01~~panel_006~1_leader=Well, <site> \nlooks mostly intact.
~01~~panel_007.(leader_is_loner_>_60)~1_leader=Maybe the rumors aren't true?
~01~~panel_008.(leader_NOT_loner)~1_leader=But we should still stay ready. <coward>? Anything?

I get a bad feeling, though./[face:grim]Too far to really judge, isn't it? Stay ready./[face:grim]The dead from a distance might appear to sleep./[face:dubious]And maybe my name is <coward.greedy/hothead/romantic:Mo Gravyboot/<coward.mf:Bo/Jo> Samson/Randy Wallace>.>>/<coward.rfln.leader:<coward.coward.80:If it were up to me, we wouldn't be coming here.

Lead on./I don't know. <coward.hothead/leader/60:Who knows what to expect anymore?[face:skeptical]/You're right, though.

No risks, right?/<coward.romantic/snark/60:Anything? Uhh... Sorry, my eyes just... when you're walking all leaderly and confident.../Me? Uhh. What do I know about <site>? They've always been very dull people./I'm with you, <leader>.
