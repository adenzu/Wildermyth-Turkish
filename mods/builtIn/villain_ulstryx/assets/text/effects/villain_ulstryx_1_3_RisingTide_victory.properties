~01~~panel_004~1_narration=The hulking carcass steams from its many wounds. Hideous convulsions course along its appendages, to the extremities of its body. Then...

~01~~panel_009~1_narration=The thing's tremendous tail flicks across the barn. It plucks up <hothead> like <hothead.mf:he's/she's/they're> a straw doll, <hothead.mf:his/her/their> weapons falling uselessly from <hothead.mf:his/her/their> hands as it pulls <hothead.mf:him/her/them> in...

~01~~panel_011~2_narration=A voice leaks from <hothead>'s mouth. It's a wrong voice, weird and discordant. Like someone fretting and plucking a fiddle, who's never picked one up.

~01~~panel_017~2_narration=The voice dissolves into a sound like rain, or distant waves. Wriggling grips tighten. A tentacle invades <hothead>'s ear.
~01~~panel_018~1_coward=Stop, I said!
~01~~panel_018~2_narration=<coward> leaps forward, <coward.whm:lifting a nearby pitchfork and hurling it with thunderous force./<coward.weaponType.bow:<coward.mf:his/her/their> bow drawn back, an arrow nocked. <coward.mf:He looses./She looses./They loose.>/lifting a nearby pitchfork and hurling it.> /and in an instant a rusty saw leaps off its iron hooks, metal ribboning and rippling loudly.>

~01~~panel_033~2_hothead=[actionSmall]...mwugh...
~01~~panel_033~3_narration=A strange stony affliction spreads from <hothead>'s ear...
~01~~panel_034~1_coward=<hothead>?
~01~~panel_036~1_hothead=This isn't over!
~01~~panel_037~1_leader=This stone was in its claws.
~01~~panel_037~2_hothead=I saw its mind...
~01~~panel_038~1_hothead=[i]Epicryst[].
~01~~panel_038~2_narration=<hothead> takes the stone from <leader>'s palm turning it in front of <hothead.mf:his/her/their> eyes, catching slender sunbeams that slice the barn wall. The strange polyhedral stone is slick with Gorgon blood.
~01~~panel_039~1_narration=Each face is graven with an intricate image.
~01~~panel_039~2_speech=The word in the Gorgon's head. Was [i]Epicryst[].
~01~~panel_040~1_hothead=This town, <Site>.

Meaningless./I don't know what they all mean.>
~01~~panel_041~1_narration=The epicryst glistens, sticky and blue.
~01~~panel_041~2_coward=The Gorgons have a master. Ulstryx, it's called. It's looking for something, some myth or secret. I think the riddle is in this stone...
~01~~panel_042~1_leader=And make sure he doesn't get it?
~01~~panel_042~2_hothead=I think we have to find out... what Ulstryx wants.
