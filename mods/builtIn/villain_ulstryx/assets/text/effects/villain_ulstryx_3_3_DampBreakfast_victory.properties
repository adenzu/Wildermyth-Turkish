~01~~panel_002.(hook_is_missing)~1_healer=<deadHero.exists:And now I only hope the price we paid was worth it./Well, I'm here, and I'm covered in Gorgon blood.>
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=The old Deepist leads <hook.exists:them/<healer>> into the dark.
~01~~panel_004~1_speech=[actionSmall][brown]So you made it.
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=Arnon emerges rather suddenly from a damp shadow, standing before a root-framed tunnel.
~01~~panel_004~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_005~1_healer=<healer.snark.60:[face:skeptical]So [i]you[] made it./[face:grim]You doubted <hook.exists:we/I> would?>
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=The earth walls are slimy and black. Streams of water slosh on either side of a hastily heaped gravel path. Clods plop from the ceiling. Support beams have clearly been rushed into place.
~01~~panel_007~1_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Don't take any offward tunnel. They've been falling in...
~01~~panel_007~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=Deeper in, earth walls give way to granite.
~01~~panel_009~2_speech=[actionSmall][brown]The warren rots.
~01~~panel_010~1_healer=<hook.exists:/When will you abandon this place?>
~01~~panel_010~2_hook=<hook.exists:When will you abandon this place?/>
~01~~panel_010~3_narration=The flowing water follows carven channels away from the main tunnel to some dark end.
~01~~panel_011~1_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Hm? Oh, no. We can't. Do you want breakfast?
~01~~panel_012~1_healer=It's mid-afternoon.
~01~~panel_013~1_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Ah, but we're not chained to the suncycle. We have breakfast whenever!
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=Arnon shows the way inside a marked passage.
~01~~panel_016~1_narration=...to the other side.
~01~~panel_017~1_narration=A weird smell beckons them through...
~01~~panel_018~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]Bleh. Well did you offer <hook.exists:them grum?/<healer.mf:him/her/them> grum?>
~01~~panel_018~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_019~2_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Here <hook.exists:they are/<healer.mf:he is/she is/they are>>, dear. The <healer.whm:badger/serpent/mole><hook.exists: and the <hook.whm:brute/ranger/mystic><volunteer.exists:, and more to follow./.>/<deadHero.exists: lost <healer.mf:his/her/their> <deadHero.mf:brother/sister/sibling> up above./ came alone.>>
~01~~panel_019~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_020~1_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Sure I did. No one wants lukewarm chewy old grum, I keep saying...
~01~~panel_020~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_021~1_hook=<hook.exists:<hook.rfln.healer:Smells like damp socks. Or is that you?/<hook.bookish/goofball/loner/romantic/60:It's an interesting world down here, isn't it?/Why don't [i]we[] have a warren?/I'll admit, it doesn't seem too bad down here./I wonder what their lives are like./What's that smell?

~01~~panel_021~2_healer=<hook.exists:<hook.rfln.healer:I just smell your neck-grease./<hook.bookish/goofball/loner/romantic/60:As long as it doesn't collapse...?/Lot of digging, really./Imagine it crowded./Neat house, I guess./Damp feet is my guess.

~01~~panel_022~1_speech=[darkGreen][actionSmall]Yes, I'm Velda.
~01~~panel_022~2_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Ho-ai, adventurers. This is some drunk I know.
~01~~panel_022~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_023~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]It's said I was born in the basin of a dried caldera, to spirits of the salt and rock.
~01~~panel_023~nameTag_0=Velda
~01~~panel_023~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_024~1_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Does get said a lot.\nBut not actually true.
~01~~panel_024~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_025~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]Right, technically it's false.
~01~~panel_025~nameTag_0=Zelda
~01~~panel_025~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_026~1_healer=You two are married to each other?
~01~~panel_027~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]In times of strife, it's nice.
~01~~panel_027~2_speech=[actionSmall][brown]We're mostly married.
~01~~panel_027~nameTag_0=Zelda
~01~~panel_027~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_028~1_hook=<hook.exists:[small]<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/greedy/hothead/leader/poet:All this is fascinating of course... but it's not what we're here to learn.[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]This is insanity. Our world is up to its neck in water, and we're talking about.../[face:skeptical]I'd love to crack wise, but even I know we're up against the calendar. <healer>?/[face:neutral]And that's all great. But it's time to get serious./[face:skeptical]Did we just rake their yard for them? Or can they actually help us?/Can we stop pretending we're at a picnic?/[face:neutral]Let's stay on course. The reason we're here, <healer>. Can they help us?/[face:grim]Do we babble like birds? Are we not pressed for time?>/>
~01~~panel_028~2_healer=<hook.exists:[face:interested]/<deadHero.exists:I'm here because I survived. Tell me it was worth it.[face:grim]/Please say this isn't all I came here for.[face:dubious]>>

~01~~panel_029~3_hook=<hook.exists:We were told you knew how./>
~01~~panel_029~4_healer=<hook.exists:/We were told you knew how.>
~01~~panel_029~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_030~1_speech=[darkGreen][actionSmall]I know what the Gorgons did. Their leader... I learned of him: Ulstryx.
~01~~panel_030~nameTag_0=Velda
~01~~panel_030~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_031~1_narration=Arnon tucks in to a bowl of beige mush. Looks like shroomy gruel, with some kind of greengold dressing.
~01~~panel_031~2_action=[tan][actionSmall]*Mmf*
~01~~panel_031~3_speech=[brown][actionSmall]Ulstritch?
~01~~panel_031~4_action=[actionSmall]*chew*
~01~~panel_031~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_032~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]Yes, Ulstryx. Raised a great number of his brethren...
~01~~panel_032~nameTag_0=Velda
~01~~panel_032~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_033~2_action=[tan]*Squlch*
~01~~panel_033~3_hook=<hook.exists:We know that name, well enough./>
~01~~panel_033~4_healer=<hook.exists:/I certainly know the name.>
~01~~panel_033~5_action=[actionSmall][pink]*Mnch*
~01~~panel_033~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_034~1_action=[darkGreen][actionSmall]...and they went to the valley of godbeast Mo-Atona.
~01~~panel_035~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]And of that \ngreat godbeast...
~01~~panel_035~nameTag_0=Velda
~01~~panel_035~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_036~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]...they made pewter.
~01~~panel_036~nameTag_2=The Great Mo-Atona
~01~~panel_037~5_action=[tan]*glp-ugh*
~01~~panel_037~6_narration=Velda gazes on <hook.exists:<volunteer.exists:<volunteer2.exists:all attending/her audience of three>>> from beneath the massive horns adorning her face. A scowl twists her already crooked features. Arnon finishes his meal, pulls at his beard and wipes it on his cowl.
~01~~panel_037~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_038~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]Mo-Atona is an ancient one, a keeper of balance.
~01~~panel_038~2_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Mo-Atona.
~01~~panel_038~nameTag_0=Zelda
~01~~panel_038~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_039~1_healer=Who?
~01~~panel_040~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]The unassailable balance of Mo-Atona keeps all opposing forces of this world in harmony.
~01~~panel_041~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]And the seas, and the peaks.
~01~~panel_041~nameTag_0=Zelda
~01~~panel_041~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_042~2_healer=And because Mo-Atona's dead... that throws off the weather?
~01~~panel_043~1_action=[darkGreen]All will turn into a\n  big blue gorgon soup.
~01~~panel_044~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]And you the onions.
~01~~panel_044~2_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Us the carrots and beans.
~01~~panel_044~nameTag_0=Zelda
~01~~panel_044~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_045~1_hook=<hook.exists:<company.villainUlstryx_gorgonSpear:Well what was the point of that spear we bled over?/And the spear...>/>
~01~~panel_045~2_healer=So that's why Ulstryx needed his army... to slay a god. <hook.exists:/<company.villainUlstryx_gorgonSpear:But what about the spear?/And the spear...>>
~01~~panel_046~1_action=<company.villainUlstryx_gorgonSpear:[actionSmall]Wasn't that supposed to be the symbol he needed? To unite whatever Gorgons \nbehind his crusade?/What role has that played in his Gorgon crusade?>
~01~~panel_047~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]What matters is this: Mo-Atona cannot die. She's petrified. The reason I called you here is that I've been hoarding a certain restorative spirit, distilled from the roots of the extinct Bullflax Flower. I call it...
~01~~panel_047~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_048~1_speech=[action][darkGreen]Rootbeer.
~01~~panel_048~nameTag_0=Velda
~01~~panel_048~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_049~nameTag_0=Arnon
~01~~panel_050~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]My Rootbeer should be able to restore the great Mo-Atona, if you can get it to her...
~01~~panel_050~2_speech=[actionSmall][brown]My brewing goddess, Velda.
~01~~panel_050~nameTag_0=Zelda
~01~~panel_050~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_051~1_healer=A medicine?
~01~~panel_052~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]The deepdown sum of it is... we're afraid. So our people are made frail.
~01~~panel_052~2_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Water's the worst doom.
~01~~panel_052~nameTag_0=Zelda
~01~~panel_052~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_053~1_healer=<hook.exists:/Well, assuming all that's true... why did you need us? <company>. Why come to us?>
~01~~panel_053~2_hook=<hook.exists:Well, assuming all that's true... why us? Don't you have your own lackeys?/>
~01~~panel_054~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]The Gorgon leader is strong, and fearless. So too are his hordes.
~01~~panel_054~2_speech=[actionSmall][brown]We are too old. Slow. I'm scared to die.
~01~~panel_054~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_055~3_hook=<hook.exists:The Gorgons aren't going to let us do this thing, are they?/>
~01~~panel_055~4_healer=<hook.exists:/The Gorgons aren't going to let us do this thing, are they?>
~01~~panel_055~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_056~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]The <healer.whm:badger/serpent/mole> grows quite asky. But I'll answer all your questions...
~01~~panel_056~nameTag_0=Zelda
~01~~panel_056~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_057~1_healer=And do we know where to go? And are we sure reviving this godbeast will fix everything?
~01~~panel_058~1_speech=[actionSmall][darkGreen]It's saltywarm!
~01~~panel_058~2_speech=[actionSmall][brown]Over breakfast! I'm still hungry.
~01~~panel_058~nameTag_0=Zelda
~01~~panel_058~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_060~6_narration=Velda is true to her word, and as Arnon serves up <hook.exists:bowls/a bowl> of grum, she draws a serviceable map upon the wall in pale chalk.
~01~~panel_060~nameTag_1=Arnon
~01~~panel_061~1_healer=<hook.exists:/[face:grim]I mean, it's not terrible.>
~01~~panel_061~3_narration=The food is surprisingly good!
~01~~panel_062~3_narration=Lastly, Velda hands over her healing ale, a single, sealed, earthenware bottle.
~01~~panel_062~nameTag_0=Zelda
~01~~panel_063~4_narration=Soon <hook.exists:they're on their/<healer>'s on <healer.mf:his/her/their>> way again.
~01~~panel_063~5_narration=<hook.exists:They carry/<healer.mf:He carries/She carries/They carry>> the hope of all the land and its creatures.
~01~~panel_063~6_narration=In one fragile bottle.
~02~~panel_001~nameTag_1=Arnon
