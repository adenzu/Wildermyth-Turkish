~01~~panel_001~2_narration=<bookish.exists:/><leader> rushes to make sure the Gorgon is truly dead.
~01~~panel_002.(bookish_exists)~1_narration=<leader.mf:He notices/She notices/They notice> it's grasping onto something.
~01~~panel_003.(bookish_exists)~1_leader=Make sure this Gorgon thing doesn't shift.
~01~~panel_003.(bookish_exists)~2_bookish=<bookish.coward/greedy/hothead/snark/60:You think it might?[face:interested]/Why, does it have some kind of treasure?/[face:grim]Want me to <bookish.whm:take a few more swings, first/feed it a few more arrows, first/give it a good parboiling, first>?/How exactly do you want me to make sure?/[face:grim]I'll be ready for it, if it does.>
~01~~panel_004.(bookish_exists)~1_leader=<leader> kneels by the carcass to unlatch its dead claws from a strange blue stone.

~01~~panel_006.(bookish_is_missing)~1_leader=<leader.mf:He kneels/She kneels/They kneel> by the carcass to unlatch its dead claws from a strange blue stone.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=But as <leader.mf:he rises/she rises/they rise> ..
~01~~panel_009.(bookish_exists)~1_bookish=<leader>! No, the...!!
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=The thing's tremendous tail wraps around <leader.mf:him/her/them>, reeling <leader.mf:him/her/them> back to face its still-living eyes.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=Tendrils from its tail invade <leader>'s ear. Its voice in <leader.mf:his/her/their> mind is perfect and calm... and fading.
~01~~panel_012~1_thought=[aqua]You don't understand. How noisy you are. But Ulstryx, my master has promised us silence.
~01~~panel_012~2_thought=[action][aqua]Silence.
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=Already its strength slackens, and <leader> is able to break free.
~01~~panel_014.(bookish_exists)~1_leader=It spoke to me. Shared... I don't know. Understanding? I saw things.

~01~~panel_015.(bookish_is_missing)~2_narration=The coils fall to <leader.mf:his/her/their> feet as the Gorgon's eyes go dead.
~01~~panel_016~1_leader=[i]Epicryst[]. That's what this is called.
~01~~panel_016~2_narration=<leader.mf:His/Her/Their> gaze falls to the stone in <leader.mf:his/her/their> palm. For some reason, <leader.mf:he seems/she seems/they seem> to know what it's for. And who's seeking it.
~01~~panel_017~1_narration=Each face is graven with an intricate image.
~01~~panel_017~2_speech=The word in the Gorgon's head. Was [i]Epicryst[].

~01~~panel_019~1_narration=The epicryst glistens, sticky and blue.
~01~~panel_020.(bookish_exists)~1_leader=There's a riddle in this stone. A map, or a myth. The Gorgon master... Ulstryx? Ulstryx. Seeks whatever this stone may lead to.
