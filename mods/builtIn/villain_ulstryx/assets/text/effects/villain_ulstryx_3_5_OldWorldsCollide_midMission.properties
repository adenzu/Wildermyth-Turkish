~01~~panel_014~1_action=[actionSmall][white]<hook.personality:I studied and loved the stories of old, the myths that made us. \n   Never realized I was in one, until the end./You don't like to admit how scared you are.\n      I was never more terrified than then, in the sudden end./I never lost the laughter. I lived for it.\n      I could've grinned at him, old Uncle Ulstryx./It doesn't make me proud... but I only thought of surviving.\n     Everything was ending, but I didn't want to go with it./I was the wandering wounded. Vengeful, hateful, hurt. \n       We all were, by that point./I would've fought and clawed, kicked and bit. \n        Down to my last breath, and past it if I could./I always felt certain. Really, through most of it, I did.\n      But as the end approached, I began to doubt.../So many of those tulmutuous years, I floundered for a reason. \n         But ultimately, I knew why I was there./Souls and time flow in a great circle, a great golden loop.\n    I knew that others like Ulstryx, had been, and would come. \n        /In the end, a hero isn't made in the eyes of others.\n       I suppose I came to know that./I never expected to be the one standing\n        bravely between us and oblivion.>

~01~~panel_017~1_hook=[actionSmall][white]<hook.personality:But Ulstryx knew. This tale was of his telling./I sometimes think a strange thought... that Ulstryx forced me to find courage./Pride is a snare we set for ourselves. And he was caught, sure as any I've seen./Ulstryx... he wasn't much different from me. That crossed my mind./Still, I was sad to end it in blood. Ulstryx never would've given us peace./Ulstryx and I were both that way, maybe./...and it was fear that struck me. I stood my ground. Ulstryx came on./Ulstryx forced us to become who we became. It was his dream, his design./But others like us would always answer. We were inheritors, wardens of the good world./A hero is what <hook.mf:he does/she does/they do> when no one will know the difference./But here I was, and I wasn't going to screw it up.>
~01~~panel_018~1_action=[white]When the first land was raised from the folds \nof the sea, two worlds were born out of one. \n \n               To Ulstryx, a mighty and arrogant Gorgon \n                         hero, this was creation's mistake.\n                              And he dreamed he'd mend it.
~01~~panel_019~1_action=[white]Very little has ever been known\nof the things that scrum and scoil \nbeneath <hook.bookish/hothead/poet:the tides/black waves/roiling waters>. [actionSmall]\n\n[action]We know the Gorgons are old. [aqua]Old. [darkAqua]OLD.[actionSmall]\n\n[action][white]So maybe they aren't easily moved.
~01~~panel_020~1_action=[maroon][action]My vanity hopes we\n      threw him some surprises.

~01~~panel_022.(company_is_villainUlstryx_gorgonSpear)~1_action=[white]We unpuzzled the stone and chased \nthat spear of petriglass.\n\nWe struck a blow, \nI think, in taking it.
~01~~panel_023.(company_is_villainUlstryx_gorgonSpear)~1_action=[white]But our grubbing plunder of a Gorgon heirloom gave him a story to tell... \n\n  [aqua]...our species cast as\nthe scrabbling villains.
~01~~panel_024.(company_NOT_villainUlstryx_gorgonSpear)~1_action=[white]We failed to reach\nthe spear of the\nsea-hero. \n\nIt became his\nemblem, and his\nvoice.
~01~~panel_024.(company_NOT_villainUlstryx_gorgonSpear)~2_action=[white]  This Gorgon heirloom,   long lost to the land:    Ulstryx reclaimed it.\n\n  [aqua]It was a sign. The time had come for the sea to swallow us again.
~01~~panel_025~1_action=[white][action]<company.villainUlstryx_gorgonSpear:Incited/Inspired>, his Gorgon brethren together rose behind him to \nempewter this gentle god.
~01~~panel_026~1_action=[light][action]And the ocean rose while the rain fell and the ice of the world turned to melt.
~01~~panel_027~1_narration=The rain stops.
~01~~panel_027~2_action=[white]For a while, I'm sure, he believed his dream would replace reality.
~01~~panel_028~1_action=[white]But it won't.
