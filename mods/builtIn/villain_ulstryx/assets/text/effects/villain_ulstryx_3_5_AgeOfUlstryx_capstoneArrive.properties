Of all people? So I'm curious.../try and be real with me for a second.> What's our odds of pulling this out?/[hook.face:interested]<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/leader/80:I think of human history, art, life, balancing on this one day... and I can't comprehend it. Can you?/Say something good, <hook>. Something strong. Today, of all days, I'm fading.../It'll be almost funny if it ends this way. After everything? If it all turns into one big cocktail.../We stand a chance, <hook>. Don't get down about it, yeah?/<hook>, we have a chance, don't we? Not just winning, but surviving?>/[hook.face:happy]<hook2.coward/greedy/healer/leader/loner/poet/80:Listen, <hook>, if we don't make it through this... Or, if we do... I need you to know. Anyway, thank you. I'm scared, but you give me courage./Sounds selfish, but even now... The survival of the world, the children of the future and all that stuff. That's not why I'm here. I'm here for you, <hook>. Only you./<hook>, I don't know how today ends. As long as I'm alive, I will shelter you. If I don't make it.../It had to be us, didn't it, <hook>? Everything we've come through. Thank you for being steady, even here beside me now./<hook>. Remember when we first met? Thanks for... crossing the distance. To me. Do you think we can really pull this out?/You hear how love is stronger than a river, than a rain. More boundless than an ocean. I've believed in the truth of that. But today.../<hook>... I don't keep odds in my head. But I think you and I have already beat them. Here together. Whatever happens.>/[hook.face:interested]<hook>, we have a chance, don't we? Not just winning, but surviving?>

~01~~panel_006~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook.personality:The odds of our even being here are beyond figuring. Today, history hinges on the deeds of a few ordinary folks who took a tortured road and wound up in the way of destiny.  We've already won./Outlook's pretty grim. I'm holding it together. The thing I want most is just... that we do our people proud. Everyone who's believed in us. Right?/Personally, I'd give us a lamb's chance in a den of Drauven. But who knows? This world is full of delightful nonsense. Maybe we all survive? Or at least me. I probably live./I don't know. I do wish we had more time, if this is our final day. But maybe it's our hunger... for more of this life... Maybe that's what gets us through?/The truth is, we're a talented, experienced group. We've been through bad fights, faced steep odds. If today's the hardest day for us, it is for them too./A desperate flame, that's us. Do I feel... a little joyful? I don't know. The cinder in me says that, today, I might burn out. But all my foes will also blow to ash./We can't go into this expecting to lose. Let's each of us try to survive. Help each other survive, for our world, our families, the labors of our lifetimes. Let's fight for our friends. Let's live!/I'm thinking about everything now. The world and how I take it in. My senses, thoughts. My feelings. Today, more than any day I can recall, I feel so [i]alive[]./A leaf on a branch makes no choice. Grow, cling, dry, drop, and go to dust. We're not leaves. It'll take more than bad weather and passing seasons to bury us, I'll say that./Oh, I don't know. We still have a lot to live for, don't we? I regret being selfish in love, and how different things might have been... Ah well./Who knows what's coming? At least today really [i]matters[]. We matter. That feels good. I'm ready.>\n/\n<hook2.bookish/coward/goofball/leader/80:<hook.bookish/romantic/poet/60:Existence resists sudden alteration. But there are those pinnacle moments, in story and song, the feats of heroes that change everything. This one may be ours./There are those moments in story and song, the feats of heroes, that change everything. Today, we're cast in that role, and we need to play our part./It's all beyond reason, certainly. It's beyond what we know and expect. Today, I think we need to shelve our rational minds, and fight like trapped beasts. That's how we'll win./I don't know. All it is... just think of it as one more fight. <hook.coward.60:Be anxious, yes, I am too. But that's how we survive, isn't it?/That sounds like something we can get through, doesn't it?>>/<hook.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/snark:I don't know if I have that in me. All I know is I'm not letting myself run away now, when everything's on the line./Really? I'm actually kind of excited. Maybe we finally get to meet old Uncle Ulstryx, and give him his due attention. End all the awkwardness, right?/What do you mean? Get your head right, <hook2>. We're all here to fight and win and die if we have to./Then I'll say courage doesn't belong to the fearless. Courage is for people like us. We're full of fear and doubt, but we go forward anyway./Oh. Well I wrote this in my journal once, years ago, before one of our early fights... If I die today, I won't have to live in the world wrought by my defeat. Is that helpful?/Imagine relying on me for your encouragement! Oh, <hook2>, it's alright. If it gets rough out there, don't risk your head for nothing. Surviving always gives you a chance...>/<hook.healer/hothead/snark:Everyone has to deal with it their own way, I suppose.../If I catch you laughing mid-fight again.../Even if no one else likes you <hook2>. I appreciate your ill-timed disdain for silence.>/<hook.coward/healer/hothead/leader/loner:Thanks, <hook2>. I believe that. I do. I do./Good old <hook2>. Thanks. All of us will need each other./Oh, I'm just concentrating on one thing. I want my chance at the old slithery devil./Good old <hook2>. You too. Let's keep our courage as long as we can./I'm not worried about myself. I'll fight.>/<hook.coward/healer/leader/romantic/snark/60:We've endured so much horror, and there were so many times I was sure it was over. But we're still here. That's what I take comfort in./The thing to remember is that life itself is meaningful. Lose a battle, keep a life, and there's always tomorrow. Even today, I'll say that./I say we don't leave it up to chance, <hook2>. We're plenty capable of lasting. Whatever they throw at us, we're ready for it./A chance? I don't know, I guess I believe in happy endings. I can't really imagine us losing.../Oh, sure. We have a chance. Can't really say how good a chance it is, but then again... when did we ever see good odds?/Well, we ate good, we got our rest. Nothing we've faced so far could stand up to us, right?>>\n/\n<hook.personality:The odds of our even being here are beyond figuring.

You've been the reason I've held it together. The thing I want most is just... that we do our people proud. And each other, and those we've lost./Personally, I'd give us a lamb's chance in a den of Drauven. But who knows? This world is full of delightful nonsense. Maybe we all survive?

We'll go out together./A leaf on a branch makes no choice. Grow, cling, dry, drop, and go to dust. We're not leaves. It'll take more than bad weather and passing seasons to bury us, I'll say that./All I want, <hook2>... I wish we'd found more chance to go together to sunny fields. Wildflowers. Sunsets. The fragrant woods! The seaside! I regret... well.  I [i]hope[] we get that chance again./Who knows what's coming? Honestly, today, I feel strangely light. Free.
