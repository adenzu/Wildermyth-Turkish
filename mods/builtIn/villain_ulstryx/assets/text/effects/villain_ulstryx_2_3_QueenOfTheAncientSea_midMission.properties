~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The air in the chamber is clear and almost sweet. The corpse of the great guardian shrivels inside its carapace.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=<hook> approaches the edifice. The spear is glasslike, grand. It radiates legacy and power.
~01~~panel_004.(bookish_exists)~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/poet/80:The poem is an oral heirloom. My guess is that the Hero Queen who wielded this lance in antiquity.../I have ideas. For instance, this hero queen who saved worlds with an ocean-born lance.../Thought about that. So, what if our myth of a Hero Queen with a spear to save the seas...>
~01~~panel_005.(bookish_exists)~1_hook=It's just strange. What can this thing really mean to them?
~01~~panel_006.(bookish_exists)~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/poet/80:...was actually a Gorgon./...maybe she [i]was[] a Gorgon. And our stories only cast her human./...isn't really our myth at all? What if it's theirs?>
~01~~panel_007.(bookish_exists)~1_hook=<hook.rfln.bookish:<hook.hothead.60:Of course you've got a theory! Well, but.../That's a cute explanation, <bookish>.>/<hook.poet.60:Interesting. Most stories are spun to suit the teller./>/<hook.poet.60:Love, doesn't that open up a lot of possibilities? I suppose we can't worry about it, but.../That's... fascinating, I guess. But...>/<hook.poet.60:Interesting. Most stories are spun to suit the teller./>> So it's a kind of emblem to them, maybe... Of a past hero.
~01~~panel_008.(bookish_is_missing)~1_hook=What does this weapon... really mean to them? One of my friends might've been able to tell me.
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=As <hook> grips the spear, a noise begins to grow in the outer tunnels. It's the noise of feet and hooves, of tortured lungs shoveling air, and the slickering squelch of creeping things...
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=By the sound of it, a horde of Gorgon beasts is pouring towards the chamber...
~01~~panel_011~1_hook=<bookish.exists:We need to hope they don't cut off our escape! \n<hook.coward/hothead/60:There's no way[face:interested]/Even I don't believe[face:grim]/I don't think[face:grim]> we'll survive if we stay here./Well, this is it for me isn't it? Unless I can find a way out...[face:grim]>
