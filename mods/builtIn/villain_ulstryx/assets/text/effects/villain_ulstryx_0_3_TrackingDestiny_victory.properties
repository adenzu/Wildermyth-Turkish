What could've wrought such a... change...[face:interested]/Um... We got it, right? It's dead? Can you check?[face:interested]/<hunter.rfln.warrior:You're kind of dull, but at least you're strong,/And that's why we're friends,/I always guessed you were strong, but,/> <warrior>... wow.[face:happy]/I... just shot a monster. I hit it, didn't I? Did I hit it? Lie to me if you have to.[face:skeptical]/Whew, did it get you? I have some bandages inside. Wow, you can really fight, <warrior>./Well that was easier than I thought. Bring on the next one, right?/You're a natural, <warrior>. You and I<warrior.rfln.hunter:... we work surprisingly well together/ work well together/ could... We make a good team is all/-->.[face:grim]/[face:grim]Well. <warrior.rfln.hunter:That's over with./Aren't you glad you came to town today?/<warrior>, you...

~01~prompt~panel_001~3_narration=The creature's death is quiet. It seems to slip from life in a few stunned, hazy blinks.
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_narration=They'll spend a piece of the day getting the flames under control. The damage isn't as bad as it could've been.
~01~prompt~panel_002~4_narration=Townsfolk emerge from hiding to fight fires and clear debris. \nSome full of curiosity, others visibly haunted by what they've seen.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_warrior=<warrior.rfln.hunter:<mystic> must already be waiting for us. <warrior.coward/healer/leader/loner:We'll be safer if...[face:interested] Or.

I mean, I'm not sure who's safer, suddenly.[face:interested]/Sorry, I know you're tired. Me too. But now I worry [i]<mystic.mf:he/she/they>[] might've... [i]met[] something.[face:interested]/It's quite possible <mystic.mf:he needs/she needs/they need> our help./Which isn't necessarily worrying, but just... anyway, a promise is a promise.>/<mystic> could be in trouble. <warrior.coward/healer/leader/loner:And won't we be safer together?[face:interested]/Sorry, the timing's bad, but...[face:interested]/Are you with me?/Clearly nowhere's safe.> Come on, let's keep our word./--->
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_hunter=<mystic>?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hunter=<mystic.mf:He's/She's/They're> at that ruined tower by now. <hunter.bookish/loner/goofball/greedy/hothead/snark/60:\nKind of an outsized hike, given our late start.//[face:talking]Probably talking to spiders, or a ghost, or something./Anyway, what about my house...?/[face:grim]I'm [i]thirsty.[] And this place's in rough shape./Probably talking to spiders, or a ghost, or something./It's a long way. Can we leave the town a mess?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_warrior=<hunter.bookish/loner/goofball/greedy/hothead/snark/60:\nMaybe. But a [i]later[] start won't help. /Right. The town'll be okay. /Or another deer-monster. /No one's going to steal your stuff. /Others can take care of it. But /Or another deer-monster. /Others'll take care of it. But ><mystic>'ll be waiting for [i]us[]. What happened today could be happening everywhere, couldn't it?
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_warrior=Something about that tower... is just... stuck in my mind. \nIt's like when you get appleskin in your teeth.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_warrior=Huh? Yeah.
~01~prompt~panel_007~4_hunter=<hunter.bookish/goofball/poet/snark/60:I know the sensation you describe./In your mind-teeth./Mm, I can [i]feel[] that analogy. \nIt's unpleasant.[face:grim]/In your mind-teeth./[face:skeptical]Is it really?>
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_warrior=Anyway, I just think... we said we'd meet <mystic.mf:him/her/them>, we should. \nThe tower in the hills. You've been there?
~01~prompt~panel_008~4_hunter=Yeah, once. Actually, looking at the tracks. \nThey come, [i]and[] they go... that direction.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_narration=<warrior> and <hunter> follow the pounded path of monstrous feet. \nHoping for the best, and dreading every other possibility.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hunter=Just be breathing, okay? So we can all yell and go home.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=[large][orange]+Rivalry
~02~choice_one~panel_001~nameTag_0=Rivalry
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hunter=Let <mystic.mf:him/her/them> be alive. \nAlive and unhurt.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=[large][green]+Friendship
~03~choice_two~panel_001~nameTag_0=Rivalry
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_hunter=<mystic>? You said you'd be fine. Don't make me call you a liar...

~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~2_narration=A wordless while passes between them.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~3_narration=But the quiet only heightens their worry.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~3_warrior=I know you don't exactly get along with <mystic>, these days.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~4_hunter=[small]Hm?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~4_hunter=Maybe not, no.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_hunter=You know what it is? It's like today. While we clean up... what I'm going to [i]assume[] was <mystic.mf:his/her/their> mess... I bet that <mystic.personality:book-mole is/wind-dodger is/grinning moron is/coin-chaser's/sugar-sweeper is/blunderhead's/busybody's/glum weirdo's/plum-kisser's/malt-hearted dork is/snakey smirker is> up there now...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_action=[dark][actionSmall]...without a care in the world.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_narration=A wordless while passes between them.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~3_narration=But the quiet only heightens their worry.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~3_warrior=You've known <mystic> longer than I have. <mystic.mf:He's/She's/They're> pretty capable, I feel like?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~4_hunter=[small]Oh.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~4_hunter=[face:skeptical]Yeah... <mystic>'s <mystic.personality:lost in <mystic.mf:his/her/their> own thoughts sometimes,/sheepish sometimes,/a little unserious sometimes,/a little pushy at times,/too polite sometimes,/temperamental, or <mystic.mf:he/she/they> [i]can[] be.../maybe [i]too[] focused sometimes,/a little [i]broody[] sometimes,/a little difficult to fathom, at times,/a little too wide-eyed and trusting, maybe,/a little difficult, a little snide, some say. I mean,> but <mystic.mf:he doesn't/she doesn't/they don't> often disappoint me. You know?
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_hunter=Weird things do tend to happen around <mystic.mf:him/her/them>. \nBut I'd say <mystic.mf:he's/she's/they're> probably up there now...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_action=[dark][actionSmall]...figuring things out.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~2_narration=A wordless while passes between them.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~3_narration=But the quiet only heightens their worry.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~3_warrior=You've always been a little fond of <mystic.mf:him/her/them>, I thought. Of <mystic>.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~4_hunter=[small]You mean [i]I[] have? Oh.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~4_hunter=Is that true? <mystic.personality:Well <mystic.mf:he's/she's/they've> got this amazing way of connecting things, disparate things. With knowledge, language, ideas. I just like listening to <mystic.mf:him/her/them>./You know, <mystic.mf:he's/she's/they've> always been shy. Afraid of silly things. But it's just due to that imagination of <mystic.mf:his/hers/theirs>. And when it counts, <mystic.mf:he's/she's/they're> brave./[face:happy]No one does make me laugh like <mystic.mf:he does/she does/they do>. There's more to <mystic.mf:him/her/them> than that. But... anyway./[face:happy]I do find <mystic.mf:he's/she's/they've> grown on me. Always kind of looking for an angle, a way to get ahead. <mystic.mf:He's/She's/They're> not [i]mean,[] there's just kind of this unapologetic [i]self-interest,[] with <mystic.mf:him/her/them>... that makes me laugh./I've never met someone so willing to put others first, and [i]mean it,[] you know? It's not a play for anyone's affection, or favors. Just a good person./[face:happy]<mystic.mf:He's/She's/They're> a funny <mystic.mf:man/woman/person>. Of course, everyone calls <mystic.mf:him/her/them> temperamental. But I think people don't realize... <mystic.mf:he just really [i]cares.[]/she just really [i]cares.[]/they just really [i]care.[]>/I feel bad because... I was angry at <mystic.mf:him/her/them>, last time we spoke. <mystic.mf:He's/She's/They've> got big plans, you know? I admire <mystic.mf:him/her/them>. I like the way <mystic.mf:he never talks/she never talks/they never talk> down to me. Maybe it's why other people follow <mystic.mf:him/her/them>, but the best thing is <mystic.mf:he/she/they> doesn't [i]ask[] to be followed./[face:neutral]Doesn't seem like something others would pick up on. <mystic.mf:He/She/They> can sure be stoic. Doesn't give a lot away. But I like that I'm the one <mystic.mf:he reaches/she reaches/they reach> out to./Well, but... I love what <mystic.mf:he thinks/she thinks/they think> about. I love that <mystic.mf:he looks at things... and really [i]sees[] the thing. He pays attention./she looks at things... and really [i]sees[] the thing. She pays attention./they look at things... and really [i]see[] the thing. They pay attention.> There's reverence in <mystic.mf:his/her/their> gaze./[face:happy]I think it's hard not to be fond of <mystic.mf:him/her/them>, isn't it? And it's like <mystic.mf:he knows/she knows/they know> it, too, and that just makes me feel all the more... twisty. Inside. Um... but. Sorry I also just think <mystic.mf:he's/she's/they're> pretty?/[face:happy]It's pretty impossible not to fall in love with <mystic.mf:him/her/them>, in [i]some[] way. That sour look? That sleepy way <mystic.mf:he smiles/she smiles/they smile> when you catch <mystic.mf:him/her/them> with <mystic.mf:his/her/their> guard down, and <mystic.mf:he's/she's/they're> just [i]happy[]? Yeah. Um. Sorry.>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_hunter=And plus, it seems like... no matter where <mystic.mf:he goes/she goes/they go>...
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_action=[dark][actionSmall]...we tend to have adventures.
