.blurb=The meanings of the epicryst are revealed.
.longName=Unpuzzling the Stone
.name=Chapter Kickoff
~01~~panel_001~1_bookish=If this's true...
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=<bookish> <bookish.bookish.60:volunteered <bookish.mf:his/her/their> free days \nto deciphering/fell into the work of \ndeciphering> the epicryst.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=It hasn't always gone smoothly, and progress has mostly dripped along.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=The meanings of the weird stone have remained inscrutable for years.
~01~~panel_003~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish.80:There's [i]history[] here.../<bookish.coward/greedy/leader/loner/poet/romantic/60:I really hope it's not too late./It's not about the value, \nbut the perception of.../A symbol?/[face:neutral]I suppose to sway \nan ancient people.../[face:neutral]Legend begets legend.../It's always about heroes, isn't it?/Could it mean...?>>
~01~~panel_003~2_narration=But today, something in <bookish.mf:his/her/their> research slides into place...
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=...and <bookish.mf:he/she/they> can now guess where their enemies might be.
~01~~panel_005~2_volunteer=Raise an army?
~01~~panel_006~1_bookish=It explains why we've had a few years of relative peace. <hook.rfln.bookish:No, you're not getting it. Let me put it more simply.[face:grim]/Do you see what I mean? Here./It's not what we thought, <hook>. Love, listen./I know we don't know each other too well, sorry, but...[face:skeptical]> Imagine you're trying to raise an army. What's the first thing you do?
~01~~panel_007~1_hook=I suppose I'd <hook.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark:do what other leaders in history have done. Which is... I'd have to study that./make them fear me in some way. Is that the right answer?/cook a magic feast. I mean a [i]big[] feast, right? But instead of turkey, there'd be some kind of... mind-control... poultry?/offer some kind of reward? Coin, or food, or land...?/only do it if it were for a good purpose, so... But I don't know./give them a reason. Something to get their blood going. Wouldn't be too hard.../find the ones I trust, first, and be organized about it. Purposeful. You'd want the [i]right[] people commanding.../look for an enemy, first. People love to have someone to hate./have to come up with the right words. A speech. Words have incredible, sometimes awful power./start with a grand idea. A way for them to become, you know. What everyone wants to be. Heroes./study morthificery. Or wait, what do you mean by [i]raise?[]>
~01~~panel_007~2_bookish=Right, an army. Out of just normal folks.
~01~~panel_009~1_bookish=A [i]symbol[]. You'd want a symbol to rally support, wouldn't you? Especially if your people are ancients, and set in their ways.
~01~~panel_010~1_hook=So you're saying our Ulstryx, our master of Gorgons, needs this thing? What is it, some kind of divine spear? As a symbol to help convince the other Gorgons to follow it?
~01~~panel_010~2_bookish=Yes, that's what I believe.
~01~~panel_011~1_volunteer=And why does it need to do that? Why does it need the spear, or why does it need the support of others like it? What [i]is[] Ulstryx?
~01~~panel_012~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:All interesting questions. What I know is what I learned from the stone and our meager archive./Those are things I don't quite know. But the answers will haunt us, I'm sure./Ask it yourself! All I had to go on was a rock./You want to go ask the epicryst? It's a rock./All pertinent questions. Sorry. We'll figure those parts out./Why do herd animals move together? Power, I suppose. I don't know about the rest./I know. It's like spotting the ocean from a mountaintop, and all the land between is mist. We'll navigate as we go./Perhaps there's something, an old evil, that the Gorgon is fighting? But I'm worried it's just us./You do realize I was working off a rock, don't you?/I wish I knew.>
~01~~panel_013~1_npc=I [i]was[] able to find other records of epicrysts. Rubbings. That was my first clue. An epicryst is like an ancient storytelling device. A way for telling a time-honored myth, but maybe in a different order or fashion. That's what I think. And, but... anyway, sorry. I'm getting swept up.
~01~~panel_014~1_bookish=I checked the story elements here against some of our older legends. You know that tall tale? Kind of a poem, or a song in some places? 'Queen of the Seas?'
~01~~panel_015~2_bookish=Our stone tells almost the same story. [i]Almost.[] And according to our version, the spear was laid to rest in a named cavern. It's on one of our maps!
~01~~panel_015~3_volunteer=<volunteer.bookish/poet/60:[face:neutral]I'm familiar with it, yes./[face:interested]I know it well, actually./No. But get to the point.>
~01~~panel_016~1_hook=So that gives us an advantage, right? We know where it is?
~01~~panel_017~1_volunteer=But they've got a pretty big head start, so...
~01~~panel_018.(volunteer2_exists)~2_volunteer2=I don't know if it has anything to do with this, but Gorgon sightings are picking up again. Now seems like a good time for us to get started.
~01~~panel_019.(volunteer2_is_missing)~1_bookish=Plus, and I don't know if it has anything to do with this, but there's more Gorgon sightings the past month. Now seems like a good time for us to get started.
~01~~panel_020.(hook_is_hothead)~1_hook=We've all changed. Remember? All the havoc those things caused, and we couldn't stop them...
~01~~panel_021.(hook_is_leader)~1_hook=We've all changed. Remember? All the havoc those things caused, and we couldn't stop them...
~01~~panel_022.(hook_NOT_hothead/leader_(60))~1_hook=We've all changed. Remember? All the havoc those things caused, and we couldn't stop them...
~01~~panel_023~1_hook=[light][actionSmall]But we're ready this time, aren't we?
~01~~panel_024~1_bookish=[light]<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark:Knowledge is a knife to cut \n    through destiny's net.\n       \n          We go well-armed./We've learned to live with fear. Let's teach them what we know./Whether we win or not... \n   We're proud. We're together. \n        \n           And we're free./It's time we pay back our debts./Our scars are grown-in wisdom. They guide us forward./Vengeance roars in my blood. I plan on feeding it./As long as we stand together, \n we're a wall no storm or season            can topple./We stand alone, in many ways. \n\n       But we still stand./We've been fed to the flames, true. But it's made us become \n            the fire./We'll fight for all free life.   We'll fight wild and doubtless. \n         \n          Clear-hearted./Ready doesn't save the weak, sure. But I'm not weak anymore.>
