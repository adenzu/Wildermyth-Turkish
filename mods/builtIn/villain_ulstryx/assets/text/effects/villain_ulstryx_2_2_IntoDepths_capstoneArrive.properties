~01~~panel_001~1_bookish=I wasn't imagining <bookish.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark:it would be quite so... picturesque.[face:interested]/it would be so... unguarded?[face:skeptical]/such a pretty place. You'd expect, I don't know. A scary temple. Skulls carved on things. Guardian of the Spear sort of stuff.[face:happy]/this. My treasure-senses all are jangling, folks. We're definitely in the right place.[face:talking]/such a peaceful place. Sad, really. The reason we've come here.[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]we'd get here unchallenged. To be honest, I'm itching for some action./this. It's restful, yeah, so let's all make an effort to stay alert.[face:talking]/this. A sanctuary. I'd like to spend my own time here.../or even hoping for a place like this. A wild chapel. [face:grim]Our steps here are a desecration./<subPlot.exists:it happening soon./having a child anytime soon.> But this would be the place to see your <bookish.mf:boy/girl/child> get married.[face:talking]/waterfalls and pollywogs. Shouldn't we just build a cabin and retire? Let the world solve its own problems...?>
~01~~panel_001~2_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:<volunteer.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/snark:Looking at history, undisturbed. The rocks, falls, the vegetation./Something horrible's definitely sleeping here./That looks like a waterslide... Anyone game? Quick break?[face:joy]/Have we decided who gets the spear yet?[face:skeptical]/So many rare herbs here. Wish there was time to collect them./Seriously. When do we get to show Uncle Ulstryx our weapons?[face:skeptical]/[face:neutral]Easy to be lulled by green and water. Sharp eyes stay alive./[face:neutral]I wouldn't mind staying here./[face:talking]Where water sings, spirits are wont to dance./[face:happy]<volunteer.rfln.bookish:<volunteer.rfln.hook:Impossibly beautiful./Beautiful, huh, <hook>?/In sweeter times, huh, <hook>?/Impossibly beautiful.>/<volunteer.rfln.hook:Impossibly beautiful./Beautiful, huh, <hook>?/In sweeter times, huh, <hook>?/Impossibly beautiful.>/In sweeter times, huh, <bookish>./<volunteer.rfln.hook:Impossibly beautiful./Beautiful, huh, <hook>?/In sweeter times, huh, <hook>?/Impossibly beautiful.>>/[face:skeptical]How about I stand guard out here?>/>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The Cavern of the Seaspear lies at the heart of a magnificent canyon. Sides of the canyon are smooth and sheer, marbled blue and pink, molded and mushed by the hands of titans when the world was clay. Now the stone is hard and sharp, and glows.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=But the canyon's deep places are strung with fragrant clear waterfalls and ruffled greenery.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=The mouth of the cave is hidden...
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=...in damp shadow and fern-feathered shade...
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=...but <hook> spots it...
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=...and leads the way inside.
~01~~panel_009~1_hook=Smell that? <hook.rfln.bookish:You probably don't know what that is./Doesn't it remind you of somewhere?/Someday, I want to go with you to the... Or I don't know./What do you reckon that smells like?>
~01~~panel_009~2_bookish=[small]Smells like the ocean.
~01~~panel_011~1_bookish=<bookish.rfln.hook:Watch your feet. There's a few holes./Careful, there's holes. Don't know how deep they go./Go slow, love. Lot of holes and ridges./Careful, there's holes. Don't know how deep they go.>
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=The air is pickled and still.
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=No eye has scraped these walls in centuries.
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=<hook> follows <hook.mf:his/her/their> own echoes into the dripping depths.
~01~~panel_015~1_hook=It's smoother down here. But look at the ceiling. It seems to go up and up. <hook.bookish/greedy/hothead/snark/60:There's distant glimmers, almost like high windows. Glass, maybe? Quartz?[face:neutral]/What's shining up there, you think? Minerals? Gold?[face:skeptical]/Something's glinting, too. Slime or something. Hopefully not alive.[face:happy]/Something shining up there, reflecting our lantern. Probably a diamond-eyed grabdragon. Better prepare to be grab-got.[face:talking]/Could be other tunnels. Something's glinting in the darkness, you see it?[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_016~1_bookish=<volunteer.exists:/This place must be connected to the sea, somehow. <bookish.bookish/goofball/greedy/healer/loner/80:Those aren't carvings in the wall. They're fossils./Or else, like, there's a forgotten race of people who worshipped starfish. Squirdaloos, that would be their name./I can't stop thinking about all the gems and things that could be down here./I've had friends who talked about finding seashells on mountaintops. Makes you wonder./Has an oceanlike appeal. Quiet. Lonely. Dark./Who made those carvings on the wall? Or what are those?>>

~01~~panel_017~1_hook=<hook.rfln.bookish:Hey.../<bookish>.../<bookish>.../Guys...?>
~01~~panel_018~1_hook=This looks like the end of the tunnel.
~01~~panel_018~2_bookish=Hm?
~01~~panel_019~1_bookish=[small]<bookish.bookish/coward/goofball/snark:[face:interested]Carved and firm and ancient./Oh. Um. Already?[face:interested]/[small][face:interested]Alright. Well... who wants \nto poke their head in?/[face:neutral]I can see why you think so.>
