~01~~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.personality:All our lives, we've been preparing for this eventuality. We're Gorgonslayers! History brought us here, because our people's history [i]must[] continue!/Fear rattles in my heart, yes. But tonight, tomorrow... fear is a friend, it'll keep us breathing. We're Gorgonslayers! [i]We[] don't die, [i]they[] do!/[face:happy]Hey, all you Gorgonslayers... this could be the end. But if the world turns to soup, well, they're going to choke on these bones, right!?/I'm not dying tomorrow. I'm not ready. We're Gorgonslayers! Death hangs on [i]our[] discretion!/I'm proud to stand with you, Gorgonslayers! I'm proud to defy the end, here among my friends, the greatest heroes I know./Nothing stands against us long! We're Gorgonslayers! Only the night keeps us from their throats!/Tomorrow we prove ourselves, Gorgonslayers! The sum of the journeys, the battles I've seen us come through. I've never been [i]this[] confident./I always thought I'd die alone. But I'm proud I'll die among [i]you[], Gorgonslayers!/Look for the truth that spins inside your heart: tomorrow we face death. But we're Gorgonslayers. Do you really think death can stop us?/[face:happy]Our tale isn't fully written. We're Gorgonslayers now. But tomorrow, and ever after, we'll be heroes: our names echoed in hills, in halls, in songs!/I admit, we stand little chance. But we're Gorgonslayers. We've all chosen this long-odds profession, and you know what? We're pretty [i]good[] at it.> Be sure of your gear. This is the last sleep.
