~01~~panel_002~1_narration=This journey feels interminable. Tunnels curve in long natural arcs, the rolling of buried hills. The cart of rations and equipment they bring is the loudest thing down here.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Ambush is a constant threat.
~01~~panel_004~1_ship=<leader> got out \nthe cold bacon.
~01~~panel_004~2_bookish=At least the fungus burns.
~01~~panel_004~3_narration=Their camps, their sleep, their meals: all are muted and misaligned, soon with no sense of time or proper place.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=Long into their trip, they begin to doubt they'll ever see stars again. Infinite caverns enclose them.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=Frigid winds gust from the depths, set all the stone throats of the earth singing.
~01~~panel_005~3_narration=A choir of hollow voices.

~01~~panel_006~2_narration=And eventually arrive at their destination having made excellent time.
~01~~panel_006~3_leader=[gray]Douse the light, come forward quietly. Pass the word back.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=The outskirts of the Deepist fortress seem mostly still.
~01~~panel_008~3_bookish=Then shouldn't we get ready ourselves?
~01~~panel_009~2_ship=I think we have to assume they're ready for us.
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=They backtrack to a defensible alcove that had acted as their last camp.
~01~~panel_011~2_leader=Last chance to fix up our gear with what we brought. Empty that cart and make the most of it.
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=They set about making final preparations.
