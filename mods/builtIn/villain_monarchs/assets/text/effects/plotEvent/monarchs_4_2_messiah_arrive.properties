~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=The ruin of <site> lies in a natural depression. Fog heaps and flows, coats their faces in damp chill and the odor of undisturbed mold.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=<hunter.exists:But <hunter>'s directions lead them to the marked tunnel./But they find the marked tunnel with little trouble.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_loner=<loner.bookish/coward/greedy/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:You wonder how long ago, and to what people such a place first mattered./[face:sad]Miserable place to die.../What are they hiding? All the way\nout here...?//[face:interested]Old world... what have you seen? \nThings we can only guess./[face:talking]It's where a dragon would live.../[face:dubious]They must be trying to charm us./Still can't believe we're doing this.>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_loner=[gray]<loner.bookish/coward/greedy/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:Perhaps that itself is a clue. About our enemy's origin? You have to wonder.../[face:interested]My feet are numb. Shouldn't we go back up? We're being too hasty.../[face:skeptical]I do think they must have [i]something[] worth owning, down their darkest shafts... right?/[face:grim]The only sound is us./[face:interested]Existing in such a place for long would certainly change a person./[face:grim]It's the kind of cave heroes enter. And only one comes out.../[face:interested]At least you all [i]look[] better, down here.../[face:skeptical]If you thought this was a trap... I think you're feeling good about your bet.>
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_narration=<loner> speaks in a whisper. Chorusing echoes hiss from the shadows.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_narration=Vague light slips in from somewhere, daubs the underground with faint hues.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_narration=Through a prism of grays it twists and stretches: a snaking, splitting cavern, cold and bone quiet.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=Somewhere deep, the makeup of the tunnel changes.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=Earthwelded walls meet halls of handcarved stone.
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_leader=[gray]There's a glow up ahead. Firelight. \nLet everyone know to tighten up.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_narration=Grouping towards the blue light, they pause.
~01~prompt~panel_007~4_leader=[gray]Whatever happens. Be smart. Take initiative.
~01~prompt~panel_007~5_loner=[gray]It's just <snark.exists:<goofball.exists:five/four>/three> of us. Let's remember that.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_narration=Their enemies gaze without feeling as they enter.
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_speech=[tan]And welcome. Our patience is not everlasting.
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_leader=Here we are.
~01~prompt~panel_010~4_loner=<loner.bookish/coward/hothead/loner/60:Recognize that this parley comes at your behest. /[face:interested]/[face:angry][i]Your[] patience!? All this is [i]your[] doing! /Don't talk small, then. /And yet you were content to wait for us. >What is it we're here to resolve?
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_speech=[tan]I'll put it plainly. I'd like to make you an offer.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_speech=[tan]They call me the Prophet, my disciples.\nTo others, I am Deepking. To you, I have been an adversary, but that need not remain true.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_speech=[tan]I am the authority in my order, yes.
~01~prompt~panel_013~4_greedy=You speak for everyone? The Deepists? [i]You're[] it?
~01~prompt~panel_014~5_leader=[gray]So if we want to cut off the head of the snake...
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_speech=[tan]Beside me stands the Shadow Messiah. A being older than legend. Almost as old as myself...
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_narration=The enormous figure at the Deep King's side narrows its eyes. The air it breathes is furnace-like and smells of woodsmoke...
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_speech=[tan]The offer is immortality.
~01~prompt~panel_017~3_leader=And what's the--?
~01~prompt~panel_019~4_loner=Immortality. You mean like... in songs?
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_speech=[tan]I mean immortality. Your lifetime made endless.\nThat is the secret we found. And we offer it.
~01~prompt~panel_021~2_speech=[tan]Should one of you be wise enough to grasp it, you will not be refused.
~01~prompt~panel_021~4_greedy=This offer is for us <snark.exists:<goofball.exists:five/four>/three>? Us together, and no one else?
~01~prompt~panel_022~5_leader=What's the exchange?
~01~prompt~panel_023~2_speech=[tan]All you must do is come with us now. The stars don't love you. Below, there is warmth, knowledge, eternity waiting. You will not be above me, inferior, but beside me. Higher than only my queen.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_narration=One of them steps forward to accept the offer.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_narration=They all refuse.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_001~3_leader=<leader.rfln.loner:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:happy]/[face:grim]>
~04~player_chose_two~panel_001~6_loner=<loner.personality:[face:talking]I'll admit, I'm beyond intrigued. But every myth about immortality emphasizes the [i]price[]. Meanwhile.../[face:sad]I wanted to think we could come to an understanding. Not have to fight each other. But.../[face:joke]So, [i]immortality[]? If we can pass a spear through you thirteen times and you're still standing afterwards... Sign me up. Otherwise.../[face:skeptical]Disappointing, honestly. Wondered if you had [i]anything[] worthwhile to offer, but.../[face:talking]We still want peace. We'll work for it. But we're not going to [i]join[] you. Anyway.../You're a coward and a [i]murderer[]. We'd never join you./[face:happy]We threaten you, don't we? Poor old fellow.../[face:grim]There's few I trust walking under the sun. But none I trust who hide from it./You're a prophet of lies. A king of deception and death./[face:happy]Heroes aren't heroes if they're not willing to die./[face:skeptical]Of course we trust you, king of all holes. Lord of Mold. But let's be honest...> All you want is to get us out of the way so you can do what you please with the world above. Isn't that right?
~04~player_chose_two~panel_002~2_speech=[tan]Hm. I wouldn't limit my ambitions [i]quite[] so much.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_speech=[tan]But removing you is obviously \nthe next step.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_004~3_leader=<leader.snark.60:At least we tried./[face:dubious]Well, this was productive.>
~04~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_speech=[tan] Should any of you escape this cavern, \nyou can consider our truce at an end.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_006~7_speech=[white]Aug, Auloch.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_narration=The Deepking moves away into the shadows, and his attendants move forward.
~04~player_chose_two~panel_008~7_greedy=Forget chopping off snake heads. <greedy.coward/greedy/healer/leader/loner/60:[face:interested]Isn't this the time we run?/[face:skeptical]I want to get out of here with my own./[face:sad]What happens to everyone above us if we die down here...?/We doom our world if we die here today.../This is our grave if we don't run./We can't do any good if we're dead.>
~04~player_chose_two~panel_008~8_leader=<greedy.coward/greedy/healer/leader/loner/60:I think so./Agreed./Fair point./Good point./[face:grim]Let's go./Well said.\nTime to run.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~3_leader=<leader.rfln.loner:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:happy]/[face:grim]>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~6_loner=<loner.personality:[face:talking]/[face:sad]/[face:joke]/[face:skeptical]/[face:talking]//[face:happy]/[face:grim]//[face:happy]/[face:skeptical]>
