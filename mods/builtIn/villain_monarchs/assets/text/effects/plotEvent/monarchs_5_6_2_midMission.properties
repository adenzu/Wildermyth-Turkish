~01~~panel_050.(leader_exists)~2_speech=[tan]Such is the nature of gods. From a thousand small hearts, enormity.
~01~~panel_050.(leader_exists)~3_leader=That's what all of this was, then? Every poor soul \nwho took an oath... fed your immortality?
~01~~panel_051.(leader_exists)~1_speech=[light]That lesser lives expire in order to extend the lives of the exceptional. Isn't it better?
~01~~panel_052.(leader_exists).(participant_exists)~3_participant=What I did to survive among you... I'll carry that shame, and carry it longer. That's my burden. But there will be [i]no more[].
~01~~panel_053.(leader_exists).(participant_exists)~1_speech=[light]And lest you overlook it... your <participant> partook of our elixir... we took [i]nothing[] from <participant.mf:him/her/them>. <participant.mf:He/She/They> only benefits, as you can tell, from the sacrifices of those less worthy hearts.
~01~~panel_054.(leader_exists)~2_leader=I don't think we have much else to talk about. Do we?

~01~~panel_056.(leader_exists)~3_speech=[light]Together, we can mold the [i]next[] thousand years, and the next!
~01~~panel_056.(leader_exists)~5_speech=[tan]We'll [i]let[] you in! There's no reason for <bookish.exists:any of us/<participant.exists:any of us/you>> to die. You've [i]earned[] this, and you'll sacrifice nothing. Gain everything, [i]forever[].

~01~~panel_059.(leader_exists)~3_narration=The last look that goes between the Monarchs is brief.
~01~~panel_059.(leader_exists)~4_narration=Hard to imagine what they're thinking, or what they might want to tell each other, after so long a time.
~01~~panel_060.(leader_exists)~8_narration=In the end, they say nothing.
~01~~panel_061.(leader_is_missing)~1_speech=[light]Just so.
~01~~panel_061.(leader_is_missing)~2_speech=[tan]Mm.
