~01~~panel_002~2_hook=<hook.villainMonarchs_townHero:I was told there was a cave down in that valley./>
~01~~panel_003~1_leader=<hook.villainMonarchs_townHero:Looks like they're on the move./Looks like they're on the move.>
~01~~panel_004~2_hook=<hook.villainMonarchs_townHero:[face:sad]People I grew up with.../You think it's the folks from <town>?>
~01~~panel_004~4_leader=<hook.villainMonarchs_townHero:We may be forced to fight them. <leader.personality:It might overwhelm you, if you can't rationalize it. Stay here./[face:interested]Are you going to be alright? I mean, actually, just stay here maybe?/[face:skeptical]Pretty grim, right? That's our work. You should get out now, honestly./You can help us out. Or you can choose to stay back. Make your own bargains with whatever's in your heart./[face:sad]But you don't have to. Stay here, keep your hands clean./If you're not up to that, then stay clear./We could use you. But please don't do anything you think you can't live with./People pick sides, belong to this group or that one. All fools in the end. Still want to come with us?/You have to question whether it's worth it to you. What you lose, and what you gain. You don't have to come./There's no glory to be had down there. Stay here. Let the stain lay upon us, who already bear it./I get it. Look, this life's not for everyone. In fact, if you want to be happy? Try something else.>/<leader.bookish/hothead/healer/leader/60:It's a creditable assumption. We should question, however, whether it's really [i]them[]. Anymore.../[face:angry]If they've woken from their oaths... \nit's not them anymore./[face:sad]I'm afraid so. We can only hope we've misunderstood, somehow.../Yes, and we have little choice but to get \nin their way. Could be a grim encounter./[face:sad]It's likely. And regardless, I think \nwe'll have to stop them.>>
~01~~panel_009~5_hook=<hook.villainMonarchs_townHero:<hook.coward/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/romantic/60:[face:sad]I'll have to live with it, I suppose. Doing nothing, watching what happens... that scares me more./[face:sad]It's a brutal truth. But to turn my face from it is to leave more innocents unprotected.../[face:angry]It's not [i]our[] fault. When someone aligns with killers, they have to be judged alongside them. Right?/[face:grim]I can stand it. If I don't, others will have to take my place. Better it's me./[face:grim]It's not like I was ever going home again.../[face:sad]When others make bad choices, you've got to choose against them. Whether or not it hurts.../[face:grim]I don't know if it's brave or heartless of me... but I've come this far. And I won't back down./[face:skeptical]What's the point in backing out now? I don't see a clean-handed option...>/<hook.villainMonarchs_theKid:[face:grim]Could've been me, down there... all those years ago.../<hook.coward/goofball/greedy/romantic/snark/60:[face:skeptical]So shouldn't we make more of a plan? Or we just going to...?/[face:skeptical]Maybe they're just having a farmer's market? What day is it?/There's certain things you don't sell. Like your soul. You'll never get a fair price./[face:sad]Wish I felt more like a hero, right now./[face:skeptical]What if [i]we[] joined [i]them?[] Might be the winning side.../[face:grim]Sometimes I worry... that we're only as human as they are.>>>
