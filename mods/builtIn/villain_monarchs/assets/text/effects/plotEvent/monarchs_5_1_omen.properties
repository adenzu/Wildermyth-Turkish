~01~~panel_001~2_romantic=Legends rest in places like this.
~01~~panel_001~3_bookish=Ancient places?
~01~~panel_001~4_volunteer=Forgotten places.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=<bookish> located this tomb after a rare, seemingly inconsequential find.
~01~~panel_003~1_romantic=<romantic.bookish/goofball/greedy/60:The stonework is unfamiliar. I mean the style. See the broad bases around each archway?/Tell me if you see anything. Unless it's bones./I don't expect there's much worth finding in an old crypt like this./Shout if something stands out to you.> What're we looking for, <bookish>?
~01~~panel_003~3_bookish=Also not sure.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=A segment of a long-lost epic had turned up one night, as <bookish.mf:he was/she was/they were> cleaning <bookish.mf:his/her/their> chambers. The feats of the story's main figures felt familiar, once <bookish.mf:he/she/they> studied them.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=Digging through old books, <bookish.mf:he/she/they> deduced where the heroes of the verse were interred.
~01~~panel_006~4_bookish=<bookish.bookish.60:There are these fragments we can connect./Call it a hunch, maybe.> They fought monsters under mountains. Bull-men, diminutive horned things out of the darkness, and beasts made of living fungus. They saved their world. So... could be a lesson buried here. Don't you think?
~01~~panel_006~5_romantic=Watch your step.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=The lantern illuminates webs and wrought stone. Shadows shrink, hardening into cracks and hollows around the walls.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=Heroes were buried here.
~01~~panel_009~2_action=[orange][actionSmall]spark!
~01~~panel_009~4_romantic=Surprised those things still light...
~01~~panel_009~5_volunteer=I've got the touch of fire.
~01~~panel_010~3_volunteer=Don't I usually?
~01~~panel_011~2_romantic=You ever think about where you'll be buried?\nI doubt any of us gets a crypt.
~01~~panel_011~3_volunteer=<volunteer.personality:Oh, in the vague, wondering kind of way. I fail to see the significance./[face:sad]I don't want to think about it. I guess just... the ground. Somewhere warm./Stuff me and put a tray of drinks in my hands. Prop me up in a tavern./I take that as a challenge. How big's a crypt have to be? We could all go in on it together. That'd be the smart thing./Somewhere green and sunny. I can feed the flowers./What's it matter?/Be nice to have a grave beside my friends./[face:grim]Probably wherever I fell./I do wonder... whether it's better to burn under the stars or be blanketed in the earth. If it ultimately matters./I want to be buried with<volunteer.rfln.bookish:<volunteer.rfln.romantic: my true love./ my true love./ you, <romantic>./ my true love.>/<volunteer.rfln.romantic: my true love./ my true love./ you, <romantic>./ my true love.>/ you, <bookish>./<volunteer.rfln.romantic: my true love./ my true love./ you, <romantic>./ my true love.>> Anywhere we're together./[face:joke]I think about where I'll bury [i]you[], sometimes.>
~01~~panel_012~3_bookish=<bookish.bookish/greedy/loner/60:There's significance in it. In life, our houses take on our mentalities, our character, don't they? Where our bodies go, I think the same thing kind of happens. Maybe just to the history of the place, or.../Bury me with jewels, my <bookish.weaponType:blade, and all my works of art, my treasures./axe, and shroud my body in rare lace./weapon, and a feast I would've loved./spear, and all my coins and things./bow, and a fresh pair of fine boots./crossbow, and my best chair./dagger, my cups./staff, my blankets./wand and rings./garments, my finest things.> I'll need them if the next life's like this one./Somewhere private. Where I won't have to hear footsteps drumming through my skull for all eternity./What about being cast into the sea? I can imagine sinking down and becoming something else... A whale.>
~01~~panel_013~1_romantic=This's interesting.
~01~~panel_014~1_romantic=[i]'Here evermore lie Eylas and Lestrond.\nTheir love, which protected so many,\nshall cradle their eternal sleep.'
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=The statue of the two lovers wears a satin layer of dust. Aside from that, it's pristine.
~01~~panel_016~1_romantic=<volunteer.personality:[face:interested]Yeah.../[face:interested]Somewhere? Maybe./[face:dubious]Oh, come [i]on[].../<romantic.goofball/greedy/hothead/snark/60:[face:joke]I'll carve you a statue. I'll even fix your.../[face:interested]Yeah.../[face:grim]That better [i]not[] be why.../[face:dubious]We know that's why [i]you[] do it./[face:grim]Is that really why?>/[face:dubious]Right. I'm sure they would've hated being immortalized./[face:interested]/[face:interested]But still buried. Practically forgotten./<romantic.rfln.volunteer:[face:dubious]You're the worst./<romantic.loner/poet/60:[face:interested]Was thinking the same thing./[face:grim]Hm. In death?/[face:joy]Oh, <volunteer>...>/[face:dubious]I suppose they'll have to deal with it, love./[face:interested]That's... I don't know. They're dead.>/[face:interested]Hmm./[face:skeptical]Well.../[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_016~3_volunteer=<volunteer.personality:These must've taken years. I wonder what that era looked like. There's almost nothing left./They look brave. Like heroes. But they've been dead so long. Do you think there's something left of them? Spirits?/[face:joking]Look at those smiles. How do you think they're spending eternity?/Imagine being immortalized so magnificently. I suppose that's why we do this.../What would they have thought of this? I bet they'd be embarrassed. I bet they would've preferred the stone be used for homes, or.../[face:happy]That's the hope isn't it? To die in glory. Victorious, lionized, immortal.../They must've been the leaders. You have to admire their accomplishments, to leave a world so adoring as to craft a crypt, statues, everything./What if they get sick of each other? Sleeping together for all eternity?/Love is a vessel by which we sail through time. Not just through life, but through death. Through pain, and proud moments, and grief./[face:happy]This was worth seeing. No matter what else we find./[face:dubious]A little bit boastful, isn't it? We get it, you guys were real into each other.>
~01~~panel_017~1_narration=<bookish> moves to another tomb, set apart, against the far wall.\nIt looks like the others, but something about it seems...
~01~~panel_017~2_narration=...off.
~01~~panel_018~1_narration=As <bookish.mf:he lays/she lays/they lay> a hand upon it, <bookish.mf:he knows/she knows/they know>.
~01~~panel_019~3_bookish=Hey, this one's been touched.
~01~~panel_020~4_romantic=Touched?
~01~~panel_021~5_bookish=The dust is disturbed.
