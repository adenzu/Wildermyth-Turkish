~01~~panel_001~3_hunter=<hunter.bookish/goofball/healer/poet/60:Frost jays will pass through <town> before the next moon. <hunter.rfln.ship:I wonder if I'll miss them./<ship>'s going to be counting them like an idiot...[face:joy]/<ship> will tell me all about them.[face:happy]/I wonder if I'll miss them.>/[face:interested]I suppose there's plenty of day left. If I don't feel like lazing around here by the water .../[face:interested]Lot of daylight left. Either try my luck up those cliffs or head back. Plenty of uncommon herbs lower down./[face:interested]What a magical place. When sunlight slants in like that.../It's a pretty place, I'll say that.>
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=<hunter> dips <hunter.mf:his/her/their> jug to fill in the rocky spring.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=And senses <hunter.mf:he's/she's/they're> not alone.
~01~~panel_004~4_hunter=Oh! You're quiet.
~01~~panel_004~5_npc=Please... this way.
~01~~panel_007~2_hunter=<hunter.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/loner/romantic/60:[face:dubious]Hill-people.  So eloquent./[face:skeptical]Can't they ever just [i]say[] what's up?/[face:happy]Must have a pan on the fire./[face:skeptical]I guess <npc.mf:he/she/they> might really need my help./What if I just turn around? /[face:skeptical]Coy for a <npc.mf:hillman/hillwoman/hillperson>, isn't <npc.mf:he/she/they>?/Classic bait-behavior... and here I am, about to bite.>
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=The hill<npc.mf:man/woman/person> follows a fern-dressed footpath that climbs the cliffside, up to a humming forest overhead.
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=<hunter> traces <npc.mf:his/her/their> steps...
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=...wary and wondering what's waiting at the top.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=What <hunter.mf:he finds/she finds/they find> is not what <hunter.mf:he/she/they> imagined.
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=Many weeks later...
~01~~panel_014~2_bookish=<bookish.rfln.hunter:You're lucky you're alive.[face:skeptical]/We're lucky you made it back to us./Oh, <hunter>, [face:sad]I can't help but think what might've.../Seems you're pretty fortunate to make it back.>
~01~~panel_014~3_hunter=<bookish.rfln.hunter:I'm not sure [i]lucky's[] the right word.../I'm not sure [i]lucky's[] the right word.../It's fine, <bookish>. I'm alive./Fortunate? Maybe...>
~01~~panel_015~2_speech=I thought I was careful. At least I kept my composure...
~01~~panel_016~3_hunter=Oh...
~01~~panel_017~4_speech=[aqua]Don't be alarmed, sun-lover. \nDon't raise your weapon.
~01~~panel_018~4_leader=It's a forceful way to deliver an invitation...
~01~~panel_018~5_bookish=Exactly. <bookish.goofball/healer/60:What ever happened to notes stuck on your door with a crooked dagger?/Could've just written a note./Hard to begin negotiations under threat.>
~01~~panel_019~3_hunter=An invitation to where?
~01~~panel_019~4_speech=[aqua]A parley, in a neutral\nplace of our choosing.
~01~~panel_020~5_bookish=Don't suppose we can arrange our own alternative?
~01~~panel_021~5_hunter=We don't even know how to ask.
~01~~panel_022~4_leader=And what exactly do we [i]get[] out of this? Know what I mean? What terms are we even discussing here?
~01~~panel_022~5_hunter=What she said to me...
~01~~panel_023~4_speech=[aqua]We've held back. Given you time. But the peace you are so desperate to keep... it does not benefit us.
~01~~panel_024~5_speech=[aqua]We[i] will[] shatter it. Spurn us and our ranks will rise to swallow every rain-softened township that's ever sheltered you.
~01~~panel_025~6_bookish=[face:skeptical]Sounds like a bluff...
~01~~panel_026~5_hunter=<hunter.greedy/loner/60:But how long can we keep fighting? We might lose, someday./Could be. Not sure, myself./[face:grim]It's innocent lives in the balance, though.>
~01~~panel_027~4_speech=[aqua]We will await your arrival. Just know that the peace will not last if you fail to honor our request.
~01~~panel_028~4_leader=What peace? Sure, the Deepists have been quiet, but there's always word of new things creeping around out there. The wilds [i]aren't[] safe.
~01~~panel_029~5_hunter=I'll just say it... I don't think we have much choice.
~01~~panel_029~6_bookish=Not if we care what happens to the people who're relying on us.
~01~~panel_030~5_npc=Please...
~01~~panel_031~5_npc=My father didn't survive the last upheaval. I know I have no right to ask you, but... Please don't let it happen again.
~01~~panel_032~4_leader=Well, let's keep our eyes open. Focus on the immediate stuff. Build. Defend. [i]Then[] we talk. When we're ready.<leader.coward.60:[face:interested]/[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_033~7_hunter=<hunter.coward/greedy/poet/60:[face:interested]My apple tree's still growing. \nI'd like to eat its fruit, someday./And when the trap closes... Who in this world will save [i]us[]? That's what I'd like to know. /Face too fully the dragon at your door and wolves will leap in through the window./I wonder what they'll offer us, and... \nI wonder if we'll live to give an answer.>
