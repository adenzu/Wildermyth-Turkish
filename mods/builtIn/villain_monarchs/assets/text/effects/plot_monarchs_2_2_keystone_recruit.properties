~01~prompt~panel_001~2_leader=That's the last family. Everyone says the same thing, seems like.
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_ship=<ship.rfln.leader:<leader.personality:You're acting too high-minded./You're too tentative with them./They don't like your attitude./They don't trust you./You're being too careful./You're too aggressive./You're asking too much./You're just bad with people./They probably think you're weird./Not everyone thinks you're worth talking to./Oh, does it seem that way? I didn't notice.>/<ship.personality:It's one of the more curious situations I've been in.../[face:interested]You think they'll get violent if we keep pressing?/[face:interested]Maybe if we make sock-puppets.../They think we've got an angle. That's my guess./They've been hurt by this. Whatever it is./[face:angry]They're wasting our time while we're risking our lives./We must be stepping wrong with them, somewhere.../People. Stubborn fools./I sense a sorrow here.../[face:skeptical]You'd think they'd want help.../I've noticed. Think they're hiding something on purpose?>/It's not your fault, love. Just haven't found the right person./That's what I noticed.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=Household to household, accounts abound of folks young and old abandoning their families to follow some splendid, eloquent priest.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=But questions of any depth prove fruitless.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_leader=Or they're too frightened to say.
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_ship=It's either that they don't know where the people are going...
~01~prompt~panel_004~4_action=[pink]mbeh...
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_volunteer=<volunteer.healer.60:Sorry to interrupt, but... \nthis about the cultists?/[face:talking]You're the ones asking about \nthe cultists, aren't you?>
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_leader=<volunteer.healer.60:Oh. Who're you?/Have we spoken to [i]<volunteer.mf:him/her/them>[] yet?>
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_volunteer=I'm <volunteer.fullname>, I'm [i]from[] here. You want to know why folks won't give you all the facts?
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_volunteer=<volunteer.personality:Figured that was implied./[face:interested]Will I? I guess I will./[face:happy]I'll tell anyone anything. But.../Oh. Well, yeah, I might./[face:interested]If it'll be useful to you, sure./[face:grim]Depends. You're not cowards, are you?/[face:talking]I'll tell you what they won't./Hm. Well./[face:talking]It's like with all people, I think./[face:happy]You look like heroes off the page./[face:dubious]Uhh, didn't I just say so?> You plan on doing something about the trouble?
~01~prompt~panel_009~4_ship=I suppose you'll tell us?
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_volunteer=Alright. Well...
~01~prompt~panel_010~4_ship=That's why we're here.
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_volunteer=The thing with this town... there was always a lot of pride. Our kind of folk are strong, wise, caked in good earth and rich in laughter.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_volunteer=That's the <town> I grew up in. <volunteer.loner.60:I just loved watching it all.../I was a kid, and knew it would last forever.> Bonfires in autumn, spring dances, feasts at wintertide and midsummer...
~01~prompt~panel_013~3_volunteer=And... anyway...
~01~prompt~panel_013~4_action=[pink]mbeh...
~01~prompt~panel_014~3_volunteer=Times got tougher. About six or seven years ago. Animals started disappearing. Homesteads on the outskirts burned. People got sick for no reason. And food died in the fields. Distrust. Deceit.
~01~prompt~panel_015~4_ship=For six years?
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_volunteer=That's what I remember. \nSo when this preaching \nwoman comes through...
~01~prompt~panel_017~4_leader=She seems to have all the answers. Knows every ailment, and how to treat it. She's a savior.
~01~prompt~panel_017~5_ship=And folks, especially young folks, \nthey want to follow her.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_volunteer=<volunteer.hothead.60:/[face:sad]>And we're all too proud to say anything. Do anything. We see what's happened, but we don't admit to ourselves that we've been taken for fools.
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_leader=So how do we find them? \nSet things right?
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_volunteer=I've got a good idea where they went. <volunteer.personality:[face:skeptical]I'm a quick study. All I ask is that you let me accompany you, and see for myself... whatever's happened to them./[face:interested]And I can't believe I'm going to ask this, but... can I go with you? This town needs you, and I'd... I'd like to be able to help./[face:talking]So here's the plan: I show you the way, you show me how to be better than a farmer for the rest of my life. How's that?/[face:skeptical]But let's make a deal. I show you the way, I get some training, some gear. And if I'm good, you let me stay on with you. Yeah?/[face:grim]And my plan is basically, I show you the way, and we take care of this problem together. I can be useful./Take me with you and I'll show you the way. I'll be good in a fight, I know I will. Teach me, and I'll outpace you!/[face:grim]I'll guide you there, but let me come along and fight. Teach me what you can. I want to be able to defend my people.../[face:grim]I'll show you. And in the meantime, teach me something. I'd like to go off on my own, one day. Far from here./[face:grim]Let me be the hound, and I'll sniff them out. You'll have to teach me some tricks, of course... But I want to learn. Grow./[face:happy]Let me go with you, show you the way. I always knew I'd get out of here. Believe me, I'm more than worth the risk.../[face:skeptical]And... I don't really see why I shouldn't come along. Right? I could be good with a... you know. A fighting-tool of some sort.>
~01~prompt~panel_021~6_leader=<leader.rfln.ship:[face:dubious]You're in favor, I suppose?/What do [i]you[] think?/Your call, love./Your call.>
~01~prompt~panel_021~7_ship=<ship.coward/goofball/greedy/leader/loner/romantic/60:One more set of hands can't hurt, right?/[face:happy]I'm already thinking up nicknames. Hold on.../<volunteer.mf:He stops/She stops/They stop> a blade at the [i]very[] least./There's little to lose in trusting <volunteer.mf:him/her/them>./I don't really care./[face:happy]Everyone deserves a chance./No one's ever suffered for [i]more[] help, have they?>
