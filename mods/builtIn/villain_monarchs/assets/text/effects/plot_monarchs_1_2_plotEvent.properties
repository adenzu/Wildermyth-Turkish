~01~~panel_003~1_narration=The windmill smells like sackcloth. It's cool, dusty, decaying. Slow-twirling blades groan overhead as a splintered center shaft twists uselessly in the ceiling.

~01~~panel_006.(loner_exists)~2_loner=<hook.villainMonarchs_theKid:<loner.villainMonarchs_Legacy2:We all do the best we can./>/> The Old Jasper Mill. I remember hearing of this place. Built a couple generations back, kept running all that time. Until recently, it looks like, two or three years. People do the best they can. But the seasons are relentlessly changing.
~01~~panel_007.(loner_exists)~1_leader=[face:neutral]True enough.

But brave friends are a good thing to settle for./[face:happy]To change with them... that's about all we can do, isn't it?/[face:grim]It's a tough life we've signed up for. But there are no easy paths./[face:grim]It's just a thing we do. We all have to change with the seasons, or be buried with them./[face:grim]It's a hard thing. We just do what we can./[face:interested]To change with them takes courage. Friends are where that courage comes from./[face:happy]It's our joy and our sorrow. We can only hope to live well, and not die alone./[face:skeptical]We all have to die, someday. We do what we do so it won't have been a waste.>

~01~~panel_010.(loner_is_missing)~3_hook=Such an empty night. Why aren't there more stars?
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=The road they've reclaimed will see new traffic soon. \nIt will open the way for travelers, trade, and peace.
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=But shadows collect in the places shadows do.
~01~~panel_012~2_narration=By the rocks and the ruins.
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=Deep under roots of mountains.
