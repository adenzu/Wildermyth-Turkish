~01~~panel_002~1_healer=<bookish.exists:<healer.rfln.loner:[face:grim]It was a mistake sending <loner>. Now we're left wondering, while <loner.mf:he's/she's/they're> probably bones somewhere underneath us./[face:grim]<loner>'s competent enough. Still, it's a long time for anyone to be gone. Especially down there.../[face:sad]It's a long time, now. Without <loner>, not knowing where <loner.mf:he is/she is/they are>. If <loner.mf:he needs/she needs/they need> help. Or what if...?/I don't claim to know what might be down there, or what <loner.fullname>'s capable of. But <loner.mf:he's/she's/they've> been gone a year now...[face:skeptical]>/>
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=<bookish.exists:/<loner>'s been gone for a year now. Strained and alone, <healer> can only wait. <loner.rfln.healer:Despite their mutual distaste for one another, it's clear to <healer> that things are worse without <loner.mf:him/her/them>.//The two have never been apart for this long./>>

~01~~panel_003~3_narration=<bookish.exists:/As <healer.mf:he's/she's/they're> about to give up, <healer> sees a glimmer that causes <healer.mf:him/her/them> to douse <healer.mf:his/her/their> lantern.>
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=Out of the black fathoms, a red \nstar swims towards <bookish.exists:them/<healer.mf:him/her/them>>.
~01~~panel_005~3_bookish=<bookish.exists:[gray]Is it <loner.mf:him/her/them>?/>
~01~~panel_005~6_healer=<bookish.exists:[gray]It's [i]someone[]./[gray]Come on... please...>
~01~~panel_006~2_narration=Later...
~01~~panel_006~3_healer=<healer.rfln.loner:[face:skeptical]//[face:happy]/>Sun must feel good.
~01~~panel_007~3_loner=<loner.personality:I learned so much down there... about the mind, about darkness, and our desire for contact. And it wasn't worth knowing./How did I make it through? After a while, it was terror that drove me. Fear I'd never feel the sun, or see my friends again.../Oh, I'm sure it does. Trees probably feel good too, don't they? It's alright, World. <loner>'s back./I would give up everything I own just to remain up here. In the sun, wind, trees./The sun's so warm. Did you know how warm and beautiful it is? And <bookish.exists:both of />you. You're <bookish.exists:both />beautiful./Good? It feels like... I mean I just never thought I'd be this affected by the sight of trees, leaves, the sun. Birds./There were times I was sure I'd never see it again. Thinking of your <bookish.exists:faces/face> helped me push through./I didn't know how much I'd miss it. Or even miss... anyway./Ask the parched field how rain feels. Ask the chained wolf about the joy of running free./<bookish.rfln.loner:<healer.rfln.loner:I thought I'd die without seeing <loner.awm:her/him> again. But the birds...!/I thought I'd die without seeing <loner.awm:her/him> again. But the birds...!/Daylight... yes.

~01~~panel_008~5_loner=One thing I'll say... Our enemy called himself a king, and from what I saw, he wasn't exaggerating.
~01~~panel_008~6_healer=What [i]did[] you see?
~01~~panel_009~2_bookish=<bookish.exists:How deep down did you go? Were you ever spotted?/>
~01~~panel_009~3_loner=The tunnels go forever, and they branch and meet dead ends, they loop and tangle. Who knows how many entrances there are, hidden around...
~01~~panel_010~1_loner=At the end of all that darkness, I did come upon... what was it, a kind of castle? Within a huge cavern, a thing of spires and stone, a whole civilization, almost. And the Deepking. I saw him.
~01~~panel_012~3_loner=<participant.exists:I didn't see <participant>. Didn't stay long, though./Their home. Their fortress, really.>
~01~~panel_012~4_healer=<participant.exists:But... dare I ask...?/Their home?>
~01~~panel_013~2_bookish=<bookish.exists:<bookish.rfln.loner:[face:skeptical]//[gray]I should've gone with you, love. \nI'm sorry.[face:sad]/>/>
~01~~panel_013~3_loner=I'll tell you, it seems almost unreal, now. A nightmare world. A land of lostlings, windless and cold.
~01~~panel_013~4_healer=<healer.rfln.loner:[face:skeptical]/[face:grim]/[face:sad]/[face:neutral]>
~01~~panel_014~3_loner=And much as I'm not anxious to leave the surface again...
~01~~panel_015~3_loner=If we're looking for a way to stop them, to quench the Deepist leaders and collapse their order... I think we've found it.
~01~~panel_016~5_healer=So we fight the beast in its den?
~01~~panel_017~4_loner=One way or another, this war has to end. \nI think this may be our best chance.
