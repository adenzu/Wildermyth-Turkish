~01~~panel_001~2_ship=<romantic.exists:/Another wrecked home...>
~01~~panel_001~3_romantic=<romantic.exists:There's more like this, further we go./>
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Only the crows are pleased, singing to the smell of burnt homes, burnt flesh.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=Elsewhere in the woods...
~01~~panel_004~2_leader=Here it is.
~01~~panel_005~1_npc=Pretty secluded place.
~01~~panel_006~2_leader=Fixed this old cottage up <loner.mf:himself/herself/themself>. <loner.villainMonarchs_theKid:<loner.mf:He's/She's/They've> had the experience your child did. Went further, though./<loner.mf:He's/She's/They're> definitely capable, <leader.rfln.loner:despite maybe how <loner.mf:he looks/she looks/they look> /someone I've depended on./and <loner.mf:he looks/she looks/they look> the part, too./or so I've been told.>> And <town>'s just the other side of that hill back there.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=The door swings open before <leader> can knock.
~01~~panel_007~2_loner=Who's shouting out here? Is that...?
~01~~panel_008~2_loner=<loner.rfln.leader:[face:skeptical]Oh. That's who I thought it was./[face:joy]<leader>! How long has it been?/[face:happy]<leader>! It's really you! It's so good to see you again.../<leader>? What brings you here?>
~01~~panel_008~3_leader=<leader.rfln.loner:[face:dubious]/[face:joke]/[face:happy]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_009~4_leader=It's almost a year since I left for <site>. Feels like longer.
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=The woodland cottage is small but not cramped. Singed spice and the odor of old cooking oil tangle cozily in the air.
~01~~panel_011~4_leader=<leader.rfln.loner:Figures I'd find you here, all comfortable./<leader.bookish/greedy/loner/60:Glad to see you've got some books on hand./You've made this place pretty comfortable./This place is nicely tucked way./How've you been?>/I'll admit, it wasn't easy. I mean... I thought about you./We never talked much. Sorry to just show up.>
~01~~panel_011~5_loner=Who's this?
~01~~panel_012~1_leader=<npc.mf:His/Her/Their> <npc.awm:wife/husband> and kids are with <npc.mf:his/her/their> cousin on a nearby farm. I brought <npc.mf:him/her/them> to you because...
~01~~panel_013~2_npc=<npc.fullname>. I'm from <site>...
~01~~panel_014~5_loner=It's those cultists again, isn't it? <loner.villainMonarchs_theKid:The ones I would've sworn to...?/Crawled out of their holes...?>
~01~~panel_014~6_npc=They were meeting with my <npc2.mf:son/daughter/child>.
~01~~panel_015~1_leader=The kid's okay. <npc> here had to move <npc.mf:his/her/their> whole family, though.
~01~~panel_016~2_npc=The neighbor's <npc2.mf:boy/girl/kid> put on one of their masks, and went with them. And I knew it was nothing I could fight.
~01~~panel_017~3_leader=It's quite a ways. <town.directionTo.site:Up the north/Up the northeast/Along the east/Down the southeast/Down the south/Down the southwest/Along the west/Up the northwest/Up the> road through territory that's gone wild. But I think...
~01~~panel_018~5_loner=That we should lend a hand? <loner.personality:I question the wisdom of that, somewhat. Or to put it candidly.../Honestly... How far are we talking? And what can we expect to face?/[face:skeptical]Yeah, except it's kind of strange isn't it?/[face:skeptical]I'm not so sure. Is there anything in it for us, aside from gratitude?/I agree. But also, it strikes me... are we being realistic?/[face:skeptical]We're always the ones to throw ourselves out there, aren't we?/Yes, I believe you're right. I believe it, I feel it. My misgiving is that.../[face:skeptical]I don't know./It's not going to be simple, is it? And perhaps we don't have much choice, after all./Of course we should. It's what we do, it's why we're known. I just wonder.../Yeah, why wouldn't we? We're big enough suckers.>
~01~~panel_019~3_speech=When the act of helping one puts you into the hopes of all who need helping.
~01~~panel_020~1_loner=I've heard it called the weight of wellmeaning.
~01~~panel_021~2_leader=<leader.personality:[face:skeptical]It's the logic of mutual service, <loner>. The able are called on to help. And when they're not able, others rise to help them in turn./[face:interested]Doing nothing, though... that just invites the danger to grow, doesn't it?/Look at you, making a mess of things in your mind again./[face:angry]There's rewards to what we do. Look at this house. Your shelves.../I know what you're saying. And I know we're all a little bit rusty, too. But people need us./[face:angry]Look at this house you've got. Tell me you'll sit here warming your toes while the world burns./Those that can defend the meek ought to. It's really that simple. /[face:interested]Imagine [i]me[] convincing [i]you[] to think of everyone else./If you want to talk weights, then weigh your potential obligation against the guilt of staying safely put./[face:happy]I won't pretend it's not a dangerous line we walk. But admit it... that's part of why we walk it./I see how it is. You're comfy now. You ever think all you've gotten might be due to the help [i]you've[] been given?>
~01~~panel_021~3_loner=<loner.bookish/coward/greedy/hothead/loner/poet/60:Let's be cognizant of our own limits./[face:interested]Isn't there anyone else? Closer to it?/It's about investing our efforts shrewdly.../We can't solve [i]every[] problem./Can't save [i]everyone[]./Let's just be wary of overpromising./I wish we could save [i]everyone[], <leader>. But...>
~01~~panel_023~2_npc=I understand it's not your fight. <site> is far away, after all. We left it far behind.
~01~~panel_024~1_narration=<npc> opens the door and...
~01~~panel_025~2_action=[tan][actionLarge]Thump!
~01~~panel_026~3_leader=Yeah.
~01~~panel_026~4_loner=I was only saying...
~01~~panel_027~1_narration=The door opens back up.
~01~~panel_027~2_action=[tan][action]Creeaaak...
~01~~panel_027~4_ship=<loner><ship.rfln.loner:, you old hermit//, love/>, are you aware there's a...
~01~~panel_028~4_ship=Oh.
~01~~panel_028~5_romantic=<romantic.exists:<romantic.romantic.60:Whose attractive <npc.mf:dad/mom/parent> was that?/You know there's a <npc.mf:dad/mom/parent> crying outside?>/>
~01~~panel_029~4_ship=<romantic.exists:/The thing is...>
~01~~panel_029~5_romantic=<romantic.exists:Oh./>
~01~~panel_030~6_loner=I'll go grab <loner.weaponType:the old sword./my old axe./my old travelsack./the old spear./the old bow./my old shooter./my dagger and things./the old walkingstick./my old wand./my old travelsack.>
~01~~panel_031~6_loner=<loner.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/healer/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Honestly, I'm just as curious as any of you. There's a mystery here./[face:interested]Just... let's not die, alright? I want to make it home again./[face:joke]I never [i]did[] want to die in my home!/But remember... our own lives come first. No martyrs./[face:talking]Let's gather food, water. Any sewing kits and bandages./But I'm not dying for a bunch of strangers somewhere.../But if this is how I die, I'll be so mad.../But once we commit, we're all committed. Got it?>
