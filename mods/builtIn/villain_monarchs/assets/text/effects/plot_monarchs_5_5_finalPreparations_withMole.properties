~01~~panel_002~1_narration=This journey feels interminable. Tunnels curve in long natural arcs, the rolling of buried hills. The cart of rations and equipment they bring is the loudest thing down here.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Ambush is a constant threat.
~01~~panel_004~1_ship=<leader> got out \nthe cold bacon.
~01~~panel_004~2_bookish=At least the fungus burns.
~01~~panel_004~3_narration=Their camps, their sleep, their meals: all are muted and misaligned, soon with no sense of time or proper place.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=Long into their trip, they begin to doubt they'll ever see stars again. Infinite caverns enclose them.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=Frigid winds gust from the depths, set all the stone throats of the earth singing.
~01~~panel_005~3_narration=A choir of hollow voices.
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=They find and follow the marks they're looking for.
~01~~panel_006~2_narration=And eventually arrive at their destination having made excellent time.
~01~~panel_006~3_leader=[gray]Douse the light, come forward quietly. Pass the word back.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=The outskirts of the Deepist fortress seem mostly still.
~01~~panel_008~2_ship=[gray]Is it abandoned? Did they know we were coming, and leave this place empty?
~01~~panel_009~1_participant=Not abandoned. [i]Prepared[].
~01~~panel_009~nameTag_6=???
~01~~panel_010~1_narration=A candle flares...
~01~~panel_011~2_ship=<ship.pcfn.participant:<participant>, my <participant.mf:boy/girl/child>![face:happy]/<participant.mf:Dad/Mom/Baba>! You're alive![face:happy]/<participant>?! Is that really you?[face:skeptical]/<ship.rfln.participant:[face:dubious]That really you, <participant>? I thought you'd be dead.../[face:happy]<participant>!? That really you?/[face:happy]<participant>! Oh, love, I [i]knew[] you were alive!/Uh... who're you?>>
~01~~panel_012~1_participant=<participant.themePiece_deepistMole_head:Sorry, I know I must look so strange./[face:grim]I've hoped for this day... and I've dreaded it.>
~01~~panel_013~2_leader=Careful, <ship>. We can't be sure of <participant.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~~panel_013~3_participant=<participant.pcfn.leader:<leader>, you ungrateful little...!/Are you serious, <leader.mf:dad/mom/baba>?/Good to see you too, <leader>./<participant.rfln.leader:.../Good to see you too, <leader>./<leader>? [i]You[] doubt me?/<participant.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/poet/snark/60:You're wise to be wary, stranger, but we don't have an excess of time to spend talking about trust./After all this time sweating in the den of my enemies, will it be my allies who kill me?/You can be sure I'll bust you up if I've been waiting all this time for nothing./Look, I understand you have to be wary. But now's not the time for mistrust./Got something to say, stranger, or should we fight it out right here?/I guess you're cautious. That's good. Who're you, though?/I don't remember you. Do you talk a lot?/If you're searching for obvious truths, you've come to the wrong cavern./I don't even know you, but you annoy me already./I see we've relaxed our entry requirements while I was gone...>>>
~01~~panel_014~3_participant=To be honest, you're late. Later than I'd hoped. I've been down here... how long now?
~01~~panel_015~1_ship=<ship.pcfn.participant:[face:sad]I thought I'd lost you.../[face:sad]I wasn't sure I'd ever.../[face:sad]Too long./<ship.rfln.participant:[face:joke]I wasn't counting./[face:skeptical]You've really been [i]here[] all these years?/[face:sad]Losing you tore me apart./No idea.>>
~01~~panel_016~1_participant=<ship.pcfn.participant:[face:sad]I'm sorry, <ship.mf:dad/mom/baba>./[face:grim]I'm still here, <ship>./[face:grim]I know./<ship.rfln.participant:[face:happy]Yeah, yeah./[face:grim]I really have./[face:sad]I'm sorry./Right. Well, it's been years and years.>> I'll talk about it all, if we survive this.
~01~~panel_017~1_participant=<ship.pcfn.participant:You were always my example of courage. And thinking of you... helped me./[face:dubious]Maybe now you'll respect your <participant.mf:father when he tells/mother when she tells/parent when they tell> you to be patient./You were always my example of courage. And thinking of you... helped me./<ship.rfln.participant:I've been stuck in this dark place for so long, your sunned skin looks strange to me./Surviving one more day... that's something I've gotten pretty good at, I suppose./If I'd known how long I might be stuck in this place... Well, anyway, it's over now./Suffice it to say, I've had to live in this hole with leeches, drink at their table and grin through the taste of blood.>>
~01~~panel_018~1_narration=<participant> guides them to a charred-smelling chamber beneath one of the many stone causeways that lead to the main keep. All are brought in together.
~01~~panel_018~2_participant=I've collected what I could over the years. This forge will still light, and there's tools. Make whatever repairs or modifications you need.
~01~~panel_019~2_participant=I don't know how long we can hide out here, but when the fighting starts, it probably won't stop.
~01~~panel_020~1_narration=They hurry to retrieve what they brought and set to work.
~01~~panel_020~3_leader=Right. Well, everyone? Anything from the cart, I suggest you get it now.

You know, to me...> You look pretty... [i]converted[]./[face:sad]I'm impressed, <participant>. We all are. And we're sorry that we.../[face:happy]I'm so glad you're [i]alive[]! And I'm proud, and I'm... I'm sorry I.../You really sacrificed a lot, didn't you?>>
~01~~panel_023~1_participant=<ship.pcfn.participant:[face:sad]Yes, I... still have a lot I need to tell you./[face:sad]I know. There's a lot still to tell.../[face:grim]Yes, I... It's been a difficult path./<ship.rfln.participant:[face:dubious]You'd be the first person to know, <ship>. Because I'd kill you first./[face:talking]It's alright, don't apologize. It was always my decision. To come. To stay./[face:happy]It's alright. It's alright, you're here, I'm here. I look younger, don't I?/[face:skeptical]If I had it to do over again, I'm not sure I'd have the courage to make the same choice.>>
~01~~panel_024~1_ship=<ship.pcfn.participant:[face:happy]It can wait, my dear <participant.mf:boy/girl/child>. I'm just glad I got to see you again./[face:happy]It's alright. We'll have time./[face:sad]I'm sorry. I hope you're alright./<ship.rfln.participant:[face:joke]Just don't cry when we bring this place down!/[face:sad][face:grim]But we won't forget your courage. It's... I mean, how do we...?/[face:interested]Younger? You, yeah, I guess you do. Can I ask... how have you... changed, down here?/Then I hope I'd be the one to take your place.>>
~01~~panel_024~2_participant=<ship.pcfn.participant:[face:happy]Me too. Me too, <ship.mf:Dad/Mom/Baba>./[face:happy]Yes. I hope we will./[face:happy]I'm okay. Glad we get to finish this together./<ship.rfln.participant:[face:skeptical]Just don't bring it down on [i]our[] heads, if you can help it./[face:grim]Let's just finish this together./[face:joy]Why don't you kiss me and find out?/[face:interested]>>
