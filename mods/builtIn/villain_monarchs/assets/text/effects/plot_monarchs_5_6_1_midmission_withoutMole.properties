~01~~panel_002~7_ship=If she exists... I imagine we'll have to\ndeal with both of them.
~01~~panel_002~8_volunteer2=<volunteer2.exists:Two Deep Monarchs.../>
~01~~panel_003~9_bookish=A Queen, a King. A castle under the ground.\nA kingdom of believers, barbarians, and fools.
~01~~panel_004~5_leader=Keep's this way, <bookish>.
~01~~panel_005~5_bookish=Everything they've scraped out, everything they've built. It's pretty incredible.
~01~~panel_006~6_ship=<ship.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/poet/romantic/snark/60:Stimulating when you distance yourself from all the suffering that supports it.../Gives me the creeps, personally.

Slave-work, I imagine./Too many celebrated achievements are founded on someone's misery./I have to say, it's not really my style.

That's all I'm saying./[face:interested]It's just... staggering to [i]take in[].../Macabre, yes. But also impressive. Not unlike the crypt from before, actually.../[face:skeptical]Not saying I want to live here./[face:grim]True. When you think of the dead...>
~01~~panel_008~2_leader=<leader.rfln.bookish:[face:dubious]Maybe you can take some extra time down here, once we're done./[face:skeptical]If we survive this, maybe we can do something with the property, huh?/[face:talking]It's a bad neighborhood, love. Even if we get rid of the cultists, bet there's spiders and roaches and worse.../[face:skeptical]I see movement. Careful now...>
