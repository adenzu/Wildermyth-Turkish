Look at us! /[face:grim]The squirrel who waits for winter to forage can't be surprised when she starves./[face:skeptical]Not much of a surprise is it? We sit and wait, eventually our seat gets kicked over.../[face:interested]Could be we've had the wrong approach from the start.>/[face:sad]We waited, watched... and so we got to see it all burn.
