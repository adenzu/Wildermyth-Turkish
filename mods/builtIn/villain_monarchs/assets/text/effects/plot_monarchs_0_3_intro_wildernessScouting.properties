~01~~panel_001~2_bookish=Here's something you won't see underground.
~01~~panel_002~1_bookish=Not many do.
~01~~panel_003~1_hook=Never knew about this place.
~01~~panel_005~1_bookish=[navy]<bookish.personality:I know it's just rocks and rainfall. The formations sculpted by time. But there's peace here. The sound, the smell. Watching the water run by./Helps to come here. All we do, the horrors we see... It's like putting a piece of yourself away, safe, untouchable by whatever you have to face elsewhere./Just makes you want to dance in the water, doesn't it? Do whatever a newt does. All day, and never come out again./It's not only worldly things that make us rich. I guess that's a lesson that took me a while to learn. I come here when I can./Just let it soak into you. The sound. The colors and play of the light. Fragrant mist against your face./You might've noticed I'm a bit hot-tempered. Have you? It's fine, you can say it. But places like this... they cool the blood, don't they? Yeah.../Sometimes when your spirit feels dirty, it helps to have a place you can wash it clean again. Gives you cause to... you know. Keep going./I don't show it to many people. I like the sound of the water./They say a drop of water never touches the same stone twice. We're lucky. We can go back to where we've been./[face:happy]I got my first kiss here. It was as magical as you'd expect. Something about your first love never leaves you. It complicates you, doesn't it?/[face:happy]Disgusting, isn't it? All full of slimy tussling greenthings.>
~01~~panel_007~3_bookish=Can I ask you a serious question?
~01~~panel_009~3_bookish=The cult. The Deepists? You don't look like one of them. In fact they don't look like [i]anyone[] I've ever seen. Can you explain that?
~01~~panel_010~4_hook=Oh.
~01~~panel_011~2_narration=Falling streams rush, splash, and sing.
~01~~panel_011~3_narration=Tadpoles floot aimlessly round in the clear water. Older frogs are scarce and furtive.
~01~~panel_012~1_hook=I saw it happen.
~01~~panel_013~1_hook=By that time, I'd been down there for... two days? You lose track. There was someone else, <npc>. <npc> was his name. Earlier arrival, he was all ready for the ceremony. Took his oaths.
~01~~panel_014~3_hook=The oaths I took... I can't remember them. I ate a mushroom of some kind. Fell asleep. Your oaths are completed when you awaken from them.
~01~~panel_015~1_hook=<npc> went before me.
~01~~panel_016~1_hook=He consumed what they gave him, and he went into the chamber of dreams to sleep. He was in there a day or so, and then a pair of priests went in, and I could hear... I'm not sure.
~01~~panel_017~1_hook=The man who came out... had <npc>'s body, face, but different. Warped, pulled, whittled at. Could barely speak... skin gone strange, pigments leeched and blued and weirded... Did as he was bidden, ate when he was bidden...
~01~~panel_018~1_hook=My choices were gone, by that point. The only hope was through.
~01~~panel_019~3_bookish=You saw all that? But you were going to let them do it to [i]you[]?
~01~~panel_020~4_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:And by through, you mean...?/>
~01~~panel_020~5_bookish=<volunteer.exists:/And by through, you mean...?>
~01~~panel_021~1_hook=The deepening is a process, is how it was explained to me. While <npc> took a step back, to his blank and more primitive state, it was only in order to prepare him for his descent. And as he lowered himself...
~01~~panel_022~1_hook=...his mind would be reborn. Better, deeper, more powerful. Blessed by the prophet. And he would be embraced. Valued. Loved by his brethren all...
~01~~panel_023~3_hook=It's like graduating. From one stage to another.
~01~~panel_024~3_hook=Growing up. Or down, I suppose.
~01~~panel_025~2_narration=The noise of these delicate falls isn't loud enough.
~01~~panel_025~3_narration=Their dampened skins and clothes feel cold.
~01~~panel_025~4_narration=Fingers numb, blue.
~01~~panel_026~4_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:Time to go?/>
~01~~panel_026~5_bookish=<volunteer.exists:Mm, right. Yes./Well... day's not done. Still a ways to go.>
~01~~panel_027~3_bookish=Come on, <hook>. <bookish.goofball/healer/leader/poet/romantic/60:[face:happy]There're so many wonders left to see. Things to learn, and study, and be confounded by.../[face:talking]I apologize. Bringing up the hard, terrible things you've seen. Help me gather leeks and I'll make some leek pancakes. You'll feel better./[face:talking]Miles to make before the sun falls. Let's not be idle./[face:sad]A healthy mind is like clear water. I'm sorry I stirred up silt.../[face:happy]This world is warm. And love, after all, ripens sweetest in starlight./Let's not get caught daydreaming.[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_028~2_hook=Coming.
