What I remember is...>/<ship.rfln.bookish:The point is, [i]they[] believe it. Not the head-guy we talked to, but I mean the underlings. [i]That's[] something we can think about.../It's a clue. They wouldn't offer a prize they don't believe is valuable. Or that hasn't worked for them before./[face:talking]I believe, perhaps, they've achieved [i]longevity[]. I also think the underlings in that order absolutely buy into the concept. But. Um, where's the bowl?/[face:skeptical]Well, think about it.

~01~~panel_007~4_bookish=<ship.exists:/<participant.exists:What I remember is a little colored by shock. Fogged over with the fight that followed. But.../[grim]There's obviously more to it. Either they've got dreams of conquest, or there's some kind of mechanism we can't quite see...>>
