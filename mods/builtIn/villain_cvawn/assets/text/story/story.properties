plot_villain_cvawn_farmhand=<firstName> was born to country people, during the lengthy peace that followed the twenty-year Drauven conflict. <mf:He/She/They> had a quiet and practical upbringing. <mf:He was/She was/They were> aware <mf:he was/she was/they were> an ugly <mf:boy/girl/child>, <mf:his/her/their> limbs and features ever failing to age in concert. <mf:He/She/They> would always <personality:possess a certain awkwardness, preferring contemplation and books to the lengthy exposure of idle conversation./cling to corners of rooms, cast eyes down, and hang <mf:his/her/their> hair in front of whatever mumbles <mf:he/she/they> managed to emit./make a big joke of it, but there was certainly a fragment of <mf:him/her/them> that would forever be insecure./get a little brusque and demanding with people who could help <mf:him/her/them>, and feel guilty afterwards./put others above <mf:himself/herself/themself>, hoping maybe that they wouldn’t mind <mf:his/her/their> company if <mf:he was/she was/they were> helpful./take unexplained laughter to be directed at <mf:him/her/them>, and was moved by <mf:his/her/their> self-blistering temper to start more than one fight with innocent passersby./take mockery in stride, meeting people’s eyes with a calm that cowed them. Inside, it absolutely did hurt <mf:him/her/them>, though, and <mf:he/she/they> took this for a failing./possess a certain awkwardness with people, preferring trees and animals, even bugs, even just windy grass./reflect on why it hurt to never be looked at, delving into books of poetry and thought, focused on finding a cure for <mf:his/her/their> feeling. Maturing, this self-absorption would become the thing that truly shamed <mf:him/her/them>./try different cuts to <mf:his/her/their> hair clothes, different strategies to disguise <mf:his/her/their> awkwardness. The thing <mf:he/she/they> wanted was love and romance, like in stories. And <mf:he/she/they> grew up convinced <mf:he was/she was/they were> too ugly for it./mock <mf:his/her/their> own looks, even to strangers. The point was to do it before anyone else could. And rather than make <mf:him/her/them> feel better, it made <mf:him/her/their> ashamed of <mf:his/her/their> vanity, <mf:his/her/their> cowardice.> Sturdy in <mf:his/her/their> teenage years, <mf:he/she/they> began a long and fairly aimless career as a farmhand, working first for a garrulous divorced old rancher, before migrating around the territory, accumulating friends and experiences. It seemed life would pass and end this way for <mf:him/her/them>. But when Drauven raided <mf:his/her/their> homeland, <mf:his/her/their> family was burned, <mf:his/her/their> former employers killed or put out of their homes, and many friends, too. <firstName> discovered stubborn fire in <mf:himself/herself/themself>, and a decision to do something ripening in <mf:his/her/their> heart. So <mf:he/she/they> rose to fight, and challenged all the sum of fate to correct <mf:him/her/them>.
