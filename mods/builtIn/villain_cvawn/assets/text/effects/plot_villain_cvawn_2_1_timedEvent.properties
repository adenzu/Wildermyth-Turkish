~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=On the horizon's other side...
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_speech=[darkGray]Warlord. Wingcen Pyarc \nhas returned.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_speech=[darkGray]She stands fierce at your fire.
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_speech=[darkGray]Crc. Good. Pyarc is faster than others.
~01~prompt~panel_005~3_speech=[gray]You're strong and proud. I see that. But know that the warlord and I are tied at the tail. Don't expect to reach across my jaws, unbitten.
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_speech=[light]My news is for the Warlord, Deeven. \nI am [i]his[] wing and spear.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_speech=[light]I only do what has been asked of me.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_speech=[gray]Then you are the Drauv others describe you to be.
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_action=[tan][actionSmall]strawc.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_speech=[light]Warlord.
~01~prompt~panel_008~4_speech=[darkGray]The moon's shell is not whole again, but already you are return here.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_speech=[light]My missio--
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_speech=[gray]Pyarc is the swiftest flyer, Warlord. \nYoung, for Wingcen, but dutiful.
~01~prompt~panel_009~4_speech=[darkGray]I wish I do use wings. The way Pyarc is do.
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_speech=[gray]All beings envy the Wingknights their skill and stature. But, Warlord, [i]you[] must never say so in front of others. Pyarc herself, I believe you may trust with your candor, but she seems to be of a rare kind.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_speech=[light]Warlord, [i]your[] flight is in battle. In the skies of war, you are a mighty crag eagle; I am an ill-seasoned dewleaf. I can be blown far and fast, but it is unproven whether I would be split, falling upon the blade.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=Forest birds clack and whistle. The chime of pickstruck rocks filters from the dig.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_speech=[gray][small]Does he [i]look[] like he understands idle poetry? Fool knight.\n[]Warlord. Put her at ease. Have her report.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_speech=[light]I... Did you understand me, Warlord?
~01~prompt~panel_015~4_speech=[darkGray]It's right. Pyarc, stand here easily. \nDo report to me and Vrsawl.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_speech=[light]Yes, Warlord. My flight was <site.directionTo.hero:north/north and east/east/south and east/south/south and west/western/north and west>, \nto the old borderlands.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_speech=[light]As is now renowned, Warlord. I progressed quickly, was supplied well. Our fortifications all stood intact, and cannily managed.
~01~prompt~panel_017~4_speech=[darkGray]Far in that direction, I am travel from. Before. In my history.
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_speech=[gray]She says our battle camps are strong and good.
~01~prompt~panel_018~3_action=[actionSmall][blue]streec.
~01~prompt~panel_018~4_speech=[darkGray]Crc. Good.
~01~prompt~panel_019~3_speech=[darkGray]Then we are in good, crc. Good situation. I am glad.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_speech=[light]But, Warlord, I think the limitations of our... I think our perimet... Warlord, it is time to send Drauven [i]past[] the borderlands.
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_speech=[gray]No.
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_speech=[darkGray]What meaning is? Attack? Raid the <site.directionTo.hero:north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest>? \nGet slaves there?
~01~prompt~panel_021~2_speech=[gray]Warlord, I think this is wrong talk.
~01~prompt~panel_021~3_speech=[light]Not more slaves, no. But. Attack is better than wait? Waiting. Raiding is better than waiting, Warlord.
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_speech=[light]The efforts of [i]slaves,[] you mean. \nWhose labor only [i]you[] see purpose in.
~01~prompt~panel_022~2_speech=[gray]The <site.directionTo.hero:north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest> isn't important. It holds no ancestral value to us. Raiding them will only stir the humans up. What use is that to our efforts?
~01~prompt~panel_022~4_speech=[darkGray]An-ces-tral. [i]My[] ancestral. Is there. \nIn the <site.directionTo.hero:north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest>. My fatherland.
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_speech=[gray]Thuvayn, st--!
~01~prompt~panel_023~2_speech=[light]Do you presume to [i]command him?[]
~01~prompt~panel_023~5_narration=In two heavy strides, Thuvayn is heading up the hill.
~01~prompt~panel_024~3_action=[tan]Strawc!
~01~prompt~panel_025~2_speech=[gray]You're right. Wingcen Pyarc.\n[i]I commend you,[] for correcting me.
~01~prompt~panel_026~4_narration=The softlit land is quiet. Breezes muss the hair of valley oaks. Afternoon slowly rusts.
~01~prompt~panel_027~2_speech=[gray]Remember our long travel? Both of us walking, chased by softskull hunters? [i]That[] time, I wished for wings also. Wings for you.
~01~prompt~panel_028~3_speech=[darkGray]I was weak, that time. Now time, strong. I make human ones flinch. Softskulls. I put cages on them. Around them?
~01~prompt~panel_029~2_speech=[gray]Around, yes. Warlord, if we [i]do[] raid the roaded lands, let's first strengthen the places we--truly [i]you[]--have made Drauven.
~01~prompt~panel_029~3_speech=[darkGray]Like the armor on my chest.
~01~prompt~panel_030~1_speech=[light]Drauven are born raiders, Warlord. Out of the egg \nand into the thorns, as the saying goes. We don't \nneed walls. We need only skies and our courage.
~01~prompt~panel_031~2_speech=[gray][small]Wonderful. She's got you clumsying your own analogies now...[]\nYes, Warlord Thuvayn. We'll armor our\nhills, thicken our camps with spears...
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_darken=[aqua]Raid: Immediate Incursion
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_speech=[darkGray]Thuvayn is Drauven-born!\nA raid! Is need!
~02~choice_one~panel_001~4_action=[actionSmall][tan]strawc!?
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_darken=[pink]Fortify: All Drauven Sites +1 Card
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_speech=[darkGray]I trust to Vrsawl. He has a head. It's a good-thinking head.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~3_speech=[gray][small][i]Wise,[] is the word.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~4_action=[actionSmall][darkBlue]streec.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~2_speech=[gray]I... see.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~2_speech=[gray]If it's a raid you truly want, a raid there shall be. \nOf course, Warlord. Whatever is your will.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_speech=[light]I agree with Vrsawl on this point, Warlord. The first raid always belongs to the scar-wanting. And [i]I[] am yet unt--
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_speech=[gray]But let me [i]advise you[], humbly. [i]You[] will not go in this raid. \nYour might is needed here. Your teeth, your [i]sword.[]
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_speech=[light]I would [i]never[] try to sway my Warlord in order to slake my own glorythirst!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~2_speech=[gray]And [i]neither![] Neither should you send Pyarc. Wingcen Pyarc should stay by your side. If, earnestly, she believes in her words, she will let glory go to others.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~3_speech=[darkGray]My understand is elbow-level. But I think too. \nPyarc to stay. That is I want. If I am also do.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_speech=[light]I... then, Warlord, I am honored to be a guardian in your sky.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~3_speech=[darkGray]It is not honor to you. It is honor to me.\nSkies are good for watching, in <season>.\nNot just to guarding.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~4_narration=Thuvayn turns abruptly, again, like a man who now \nremembers a pot on the fire. He speeds downhill.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~2_speech=[gray]You are not [i]exactly[] the Drauv others describe you to be.\nBut... I hope you understand. Your staying is best for [i]him.[]
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_speech=[light]I do not fully understand the Deeven Vrsawl's reasoning, Warlord. And even moreso, I question whether ensl--
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_speech=[gray]The Warlord has [i]made[] his decision, Wingcen Pyarc.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~3_speech=[darkGray]Crc. Right. My decision. I has made.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_speech=[light]I... Yes, Warlord. I am honored to be an arrow in your sky.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~3_speech=[darkGray]Vrsawl's sky also. He did give to me sky.\nIn place of cage and bars.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_speech=[light]But the Wingknights' battleway has ever been to fly far and f--
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_speech=[gray]Warlord, I must also advise, humbly, that Wingcen Pyarc be kept close. An arrow quivered and ready. To guard [i]your[] sky. Though you generously call it ours, I will not.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~3_speech=[darkGray]My understand is elbow-level. But I think Vrsawl is understand his needing. I do a... agreement? I don't know.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~4_narration=After a brief silence, Thuvayn grunts, turns, and heads back down the hill.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_speech=[light]His devotion to you... I simply do not like it. It gnarls \nmy soul, seeing such a thing in him.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~2_speech=[gray]You pay him little respect, thinking it ill-founded. Have patience with me, Wingcen Pyarc. \nI was born small. But I carry tall hopes, as old as the mightiest of our ancestors.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~2_speech=[gray]Have [i]patience[] with me!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~5_action=[darkGold]Strawc!\n  [darkBlue]Streec!
~05~player_chose_two~panel_009~2_thought=[gray]Or am I just the waddler you told me I wasn't?
