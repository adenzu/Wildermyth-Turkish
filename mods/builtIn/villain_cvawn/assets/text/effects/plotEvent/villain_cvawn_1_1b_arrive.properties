~01~~panel_001~2_narration=Sun's lowering. The canopy tosses a gentle aroma over them, like pepper and sage.
~01~~panel_002~1_hunter=Definitely a camp here. Cookfire. Can see where a kettle-stand dug its foot in.
~01~~panel_002~3_hero2=<hero2.cvawn_hunterRomanceTarget:<hunter>? Been a hard march today. <hero2.coward/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Is it... is there something wrong?/Tell me we're done for the day, and come rub my deserving shoulders.[face:happy]/[face:joke]If you want to stop, I'll make them stop./If you want to stop, I'll make them stop./[face:skeptical]Or are you waiting for me to notice your lovely neck-back? It's a nice neck-back, I'll give you that./Sit down for a bit, yeah?>/<hero2.goofball/healer/greedy/60:What're you looking at so hard? Beetle or assfruit?[face:happy]/It's okay if you're stumped.

Or me./[face:talking]Maybe believing we're off their tails?/Did they suddenly get less careful?>
~01~~panel_003~3_hero2=[small]<hero2.bookish/goofball/loner/60:Like us, they likely weigh and balance multiple concerns./[face:happy]Every living creature faces a choice. These Drauven obviously chose to dance./It's impossible to guess why anyone does anything.[face:neutral] Maybe they just got cocky?/Maybe they thought they lost us with the streamwalking trick?>
~01~~panel_004~1_hunter=Then there's birdspat on the rocks, and it looks like someone was testing a blade on that trunk.
~01~~panel_005~4_mystic=Which trunk?
~01~~panel_006~3_hunter=That one by the... oh.
~01~~panel_007~1_hunter=The one by that Drauv, actually.
