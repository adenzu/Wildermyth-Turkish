~01~prompt~panel_001~2_speech=[gray]We must risk moving in daylight. Gain distance.  \nBe ready to march in a feathersbredth!
~01~prompt~panel_001~3_action=Yec.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=A band of human trackers, bringing numbers unknown, burns at their heels. \nIt has the Drauven both surprised... and a little fearful.
~01~prompt~panel_002~4_speech=[darkGray][actionSmall]Vrsawl.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_speech=[gray]Oh, have you calmed down?\n[small]Imagine being flinchy at [i]that[] size.
~01~prompt~panel_003~4_speech=[darkGray][actionSmall]A question. Why my free? You gave.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_speech=[gray]You lack the language to understand, even were I to explain every intricacy. Just trust me, Drevsnac didn't pull this troop together for no reason. Past their prime tailchewers, maybe. But raiding is their life, their history, and the aim of their everlives.
~01~prompt~panel_005~4_speech=[darkGray][actionSmall]What meaning is? Drevsnac? What is?
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_speech=[gray]You really like that sword, don't you?\n[small]That'll either be a problem, or it'll make him popular.
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_action=[actionSmall]hop.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_speech=[gray]Drevsnac is a name you must learn. He was my elder. My teacher. One of the last Great Deevens of our lore. I am merely his shadow.
~01~prompt~panel_007~5_speech=[darkGray]We move in Drevsnac's honor.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_narration=In moments, they'll be underway again.
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_speech=[gray]Yes. You owe your freedom not to me, but to his wisdom, and the respect he commanded.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_narration=Meanwhile...
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_hunter=That's smoke.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_narration=The days have been grueling. Always the Drauven are ahead, leaving spare sign behind them of having lit a leaf, much less slept.
~01~prompt~panel_012~3_mystic=If it's plainly visible, that means we need to avoid approaching it directly. Come at an angle, or we'll be giving them both our flanks.
~01~prompt~panel_013~4_hero2=You're really that versed in war?
~01~prompt~panel_013~5_hero3=Don't be impressed. Doesn't want to tell you, but <mystic.mf:he/she/them> and \nthat fairmaster, <npc.fullname>? Student and teacher.<hero3.coward/goofball/greedy/healer/60:[face:interested]/[face:talking]/[face:skeptical]/[face:neutral]/>
~01~prompt~panel_013~6_mystic=In fighting Drauven.
~01~prompt~panel_014~5_hero3=<hero3.coward/goofball/greedy/healer/60:/[face:dubious]//[face:interested]/>
~01~prompt~panel_014~6_mystic=<mystic.coward/goofball/loner/poet/60:[face:interested]Heh, yeah, well, that's not wholly accurate. <npc> didn't much like me. I joined near the end of the last conflict./[face:skeptical]I was going to get to it. But I mean, anyway, not my teacher. More like captain. I joined <npc>'s band. Years ago. Silly reasons, I'm sure./You're not even close on that one. <npc> was my senior, but I learned nothing from <npc.mf:him/her/them>, and <npc.mf:he/she/they> certainly never tried to teach me./[face:neutral]That's only true in the vaguest, most eventual way, as it's true with everyone. We learn from and teach [i]every[] person we encounter. <npc> [i]was[] my senior. I knew <npc.mf:him/her/them>./That's not completely it. <npc> was my senior, yes. \nI joined the fight towards the end of the last conflict.>
~01~prompt~panel_015~6_mystic=I was there when <npc.mf:he/she/they> slew the Drauvenlord, and took the son. I argued <mystic.bookish/goofball/healer/poet/romantic/60:for a more exploratory approach to this creature's captivity. To see how deeply we could build understanding, if given the chance from early youth./to let the little guy go, you know?/we should let the child go./that all beings deserved to grow in liberty, to be what they might be./that if anyone were to raise the Drauv, it should be with compassion, as we would a human orphan of war./for... a different course of action.> But I was just a greenhorn, then.
~01~prompt~panel_015~7_npc2=<mystic.personality:[face:talking]/[face:surprised]/[face:talking]/[face:skeptical]/[face:sad]/[face:rage]/[face:talking]/[face:grim]/[face:talking]/[face:talking]/[face:dubious]>
~01~prompt~panel_016~6_mystic=We need to make our decision early, probably. Split and sneak up, \nor tight and together? Speed, I'll say, is necessary either way.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_hunter=You know what my preference is.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~3_darken=[aqua]+Stealth
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hero3=Yeah. That's fine with me.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_hero2=<hero3> and I can handle the front.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~3_darken=[green]+Stoicism
