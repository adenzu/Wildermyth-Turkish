~01~~panel_031~4_speech=[gray]My back was bent, my future bowed, even as I tumbled from the egg! You could never comprehend my life, Wingcen, if you could live it all in cybic poem!
~01~~panel_032~1_speech=[light]What I think you mean is... he is dead. Thuvayn was [i]meant[] to die at the Weldwall. Do I not understand you rightly?
~01~~panel_032~4_speech=[gray]Only my blood was fit. It is [i]Dragon Blood.[] Thuvayn may as well be an ox, and let him be slaughtered as one! [i]Our people[] are here! Their king, the Summerking, is here.

~01~~panel_044~6_speech=[orange]My listening is swordsharp. Be warned, and be quiet. For now, I shall think. And I shall eat. Ox would be good. And sheep. And onions.
~01~~panel_045~6_speech=[orange]My gathering thoughts see a picture of the world undragonned. I do not know what has passed in those years, but I am sure it all wants meaning. That is what I shall give it, I suppose.
~01~~panel_046~2_narration=The night will age and gray. It will be buried in orange light.
~01~~panel_046~3_narration=The first night of Cvawn's relife is musically quiet.
