~01~~panel_001~1_narration=Sunset, and no alert stirs Cvawn's Canyon.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=<hero> and the others have chosen to come up the neighboring valley.
~01~~panel_002~2_hero=[face:skeptical]Much lighter traffic here. \nDoesn't look patrolled.
~01~~panel_002~3_hero3=We're lucky then. Sound spot to spend the night.
~01~~panel_002~4_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:[small]<volunteer.bookish/goofball/hothead/healer/leader/poet/romantic/60:Remembering what I read of this part of the world... Further <hero.directionTo.town:south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast/east/southeast/on>, you find all the land ribboned with these gorges and gouges. Quite beautiful, but nearly uninhabitable./[face:happy]Tree-climbing contest? Or fishing challenge? \nWho's taking me on?/[face:joke]Tree-climbing contest? Or fishing challenge? \nWho's taking me on?/It's a decent place to fall back to. [face:neutral]Let's make sure we know the way./It's a decent place to fall back to. [face:neutral]Let's make sure we know the way./Such a deep, rich, [i]pleasant[] smell. \nCan make a heart sad./[face:talking]It's a beautiful aroma. Music. The clear water, the wind \nand trees. A place for kissing, not killing./There's no guarantess they're not up above us. [i]Watching.[][face:neutral]>/>
~01~~panel_003~5_hero2=<hero2.personality:[face:neutral]After observing their position... I feel suddenly certain. Camping tonight would be a mistake./[face:interested]Don't you think...? I mean maybe this's <hero2.cvawn_farmhand:my inexperience. I'm just an old farmhand, really./dumb, so tell me.> But don't you think we shouldn't [i]wait?[] I mean, if we [i]are[] going to... go [i]in.[]/[face:skeptical]Am I the only one who's thinking... maybe this's the perfect time to go [i]in?[]/[face:skeptical]Hey, hear me out on this. <hero2.cvawn_farmhand:I'm a gambler, right? Any old farmhand is, far as I know./You all know I'm someone who likes a [i]safe[] gamble.> I'm thinking about odds, now, and... why would we waste tonight? When it's probably our best chance to hit our target?/[face:talking]I want to say this, because... well, I think it's our best chance. \nOf surviving. We skip making camp, we go in tonight./We're not camping here. We're going right in. \nYou [i]have[] to trust me, I just have a feeling.../[face:talking]I'll tell you my mind. <hero2.cvawn_farmhand:And yeah, I know I'm just some old farmhand, really./And yeah, feel free to counter with yours.> \nBut here it is: We skip camp. We attack tonight./I'm not camping here. I'm feeling wolfish. I'll go for the throat.\nTonight. You all should come, too, but I obviously can't make you./Have you ever looked at a brilliant fish, holding its place in the water... and thought that by waiting, you would get a better spearcast? And if you [i]did[] hesitate... how often did that work out?/[face:happy]<hero2.cvawn_farmhand:I'm happy I came all this way. I'm grateful and proud I could stand beside you./We've managed a lot more than ever we were supposed to. Startled even ourselves. And that's the way we'll win here: by doing the unexpected.> I'm going in [i]tonight.[] Will you join me? No one has to./[face:neutral]Yeah, sure. Set up a tent. Start a cookfire, let's sing songs. [i]Or...[] What if we just go do what we came for? Then we can all go home.>
~01~~panel_003~6_hero=<hero2.cvawn_farmhand:[small]<hero2>...[face:grim]/Hm?<hero2.pcfn.hero:<hero2.mf: Dad?/ Mom?/ Renny?>/ Say again, kid./ <hero2>?/> [face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=That's why <hero2>'s argument eventually wins the others over.
~01~~panel_005~1_narration=With Drauven visibly fortifying the entire length of the canyon, a methodical assault would be nearly certain to fail. And the longer they tarry, the likelier it is that they'll be discovered.
~01~~panel_006~5_hero2=I think... when the sun's all the way gone, and before we can be sniffed out...
~01~~panel_006~6_hero=<hero.personality:[face:skeptical]Ah. Interesting./[face:interested]Oh.../[face:joy][small]Sniffed out? I mean we [i]do[] have <hero.pcfn.hero3:my <hero3.mf:son/daughter/kid>/my <hero3.mf:dad/mom/renny>/<hero3>/<hero3>>'s old skunk-defense.../[face:skeptical]Well.../[face:sad]Uff. Tonight?/[face:happy]Yes!/[face:grim]//[face:grim]/[face:grim]/[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_006~7_hero3=<hero3.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/loner/poet/romantic/snark/80:Essentially an assassination. How realistic.[face:skeptical]/An assassination...! Wow. Can we... pull that off, though?[face:interested]/[face:interested][i]You're[] trying to jump straight to the climax.\nWould save us time. Probably a little blood, too./[face:grim]An assasination. It's... it's maybe safer for us, isn't it? Unless we get caught./[face:skeptical]Straight into the eye of the boar, huh? Well, it's brave. In a way./An assassination. I actually like it./[face:grim]We thrust bladewise into their very heart./[face:grim]We'll be death's dancers. Assassins. Swift, \nsmooth-swaying, and se--deadly./[face:dubious]Just don't say, [i]"Cut off the head of the snake."[] \nPlease? It makes sense, so let's just get to it./We're assassins, you're saying.>
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=They duck moonshafts and fit their frames to shadows, clinging close to the rockwall when they can, stilling when their feet want to slip on gravel. Rebalancing. Moving with all possible carefulness.
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=They have theories as to what they'll find. Who their target is.
~01~~panel_007~3_narration=None of these is near the mark.
~01~~panel_008~1_speech=[orange]Yldalee. The Dragon of Winter.
~01~~panel_009~2_speech=[orange]Whose scales and demeanor are ever shades of blue.
~01~~panel_009~3_speech=[orange]Wisdom is as easy for her as finding wind under her wings--[i]six[] wings, and they shift color to match the clouds and sky. But her wrath is so terrible, even I fear it.
~01~~panel_010~2_speech=[orange]Pyarc reminds me much of [i]her[]. \nFrom the moment I hatched, I felt that.
~01~~panel_011~2_speech=[orange][i]Mrecmat[]. Of course. And I [i]am[] pleased by you, Deeven. Vrsawl. Dragonblood.
~01~~panel_011~3_speech=[gray]But your blood is in [i]my[] veins Cvawn. My blood, Drevsnac's! My great order is descended from the [i]beginning![] Our whole purpose... has been you. This's why I find myself seething to be kept apart and scorned.
~01~~panel_012~3_speech=[gray]They're good reasons. I can't claim otherwise.
~01~~panel_013~2_speech=[orange]But my... [i]Pyarc[] finds you repellent. For Pyarcish reasons.
~01~~panel_014~2_speech=[orange]To me, not. You sacrificed what wanted sacrifice, in order for me to grow and prosper. That's the meaning of being my family.
~01~~panel_015~2_speech=[orange]When she returns, I'll convince her of this. Like my sister, she's proud and wise. Noble-hearted. The cunning mind can persuade their kind, even by trick and truth misaligned. Indeed, we [i]must[] fool them. Or they die for honor.
~01~~panel_016~2_speech=[orange]I see you understand that responsibility. \nIt's like the burden [i]you[] were forced to bear.
~01~~panel_017~1_speech=[orange][i]Cyuncar thees dravush esh... dyawl varec seec...
~01~~panel_017~2_narration=Dousing small lights when they can, <hero> and <hero3> lead the way up the canyonpath, to the fairly prominent place where they suppose a Drauven leader should be.
~01~~panel_018~1_narration=His voice is like fire. Soft and glowing on the face, subtly moving. Primally pleasant to hear, even while it's menacing.
~01~~panel_018~2_narration=Unfortunately, too, his hearing is firebright.
~01~~panel_018~3_speech=[orange]Davsuec?
~01~~panel_019~1_narration=Stealing forward past glinting articles... \n    they see him.
~01~~panel_020~1_narration=He twists round, his scales spark with speed. Nothing outside this place exists anymore. Not at this moment.
~01~~panel_020~2_speech=[orange]It's been long since I blessed your speech with my breath. Human beings. Sad ones. Killers of beauty.
~01~~panel_021~2_speech=[orange]Was it not you who told me my time approached? To not be found, but to announce myself? Let me be seen, then.
~01~~panel_021~3_speech=[gray]Cvawn! Zyur ash yecal!!
~01~~panel_022~2_speech=[cherry][large][i]Let my flames be felt.
~01~~panel_022~3_speech=[orange][large][i]Let my flames be felt.
