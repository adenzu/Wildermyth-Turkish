How much more frightening can it get?/You can't keep hogging the glory and magic for yourself. Or are you worried I'll want the Warlord's sword?[face:happy][subPlot2.face:skeptical]/[face:joke]Worst that could happen is I make you look old. [subPlot2.face:grim]/[face:neutral]Cubs grow up, <subPlot2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>. Someday, it's... \nif they're not bears, they get eaten.[subPlot2.face:grim]/[face:talking]Cubs grow up, <subPlot2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>. And [i]"If they don't become bears, they shall soon become bones."[subPlot2.face:grim]/<hook.cvawn_waterlingParent:[face:happy]If my quest goes like yours did... I expect I'll marry a <hook.awm:tree-woman/tree-man>, in some forest somewhere./[face:happy]My eyes can't stay innocent forever. All I've ever wanted was to be like my <hook.cvawn_fallbackParent:<subPlot2.mf:dad/mom/renny>./parents.> Well. And marry a beautiful <hook.awm:lady/man>. Maybe it won't be a storybook, but I won't aim low.>[subPlot2.face:dubious]/[face:talking]Pain's a good teacher, <subPlot2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>. That's why I'm so dumb, is I was too coddled. Let me get out there and... I don't know. Anything that happens next will be something new./[face:neutral]Thank you for letting it be my choice.>
~01~~panel_047.(parent_NOT_alive)~1_hunter=Young <hook.lastname>? Not your watch tonight.<hunter.loner/snark/60:[face:neutral] You feel sick?/[face:skeptical]Not performing some weird ritual are you? I'm not in the mood./You restless? Anxious what it'll be like out there?>
~01~~panel_048.(parent_NOT_alive)~1_hunter=<subPlot>? I believe <subPlot.mf:he/she/they> would've. We grew up shaped, in many ways, by the Drauven conflicts. But <subPlot> had a lot more nuance than that. It was complicated with <subPlot.mf:him/her/them>.
~01~~panel_048.(parent_NOT_alive)~2_hook=I'm. Okay. Hey, <hunter>.... Would my <subPlot.mf:dad/mom/renny>'ve come along on this trip?\nIt's not necessarily a... I don't know.
~01~~panel_049.(parent_NOT_alive)~1_hunter=<subPlot.mf:Your father/Your mother/<subPlot>> watches over you. <subPlot.mf:He/She/They> always thought about your future.
~01~~panel_049.(parent_NOT_alive)~2_hook=<hook.personality:[face:neutral]<subPlot.mf:His/Her/Their> journals extensively outline... just how unsure <subPlot.mf:he was/she was/they were>. Especially about this [i]Thuvayn?[] My preparation for the encounter has been, and will continue to be meticulous.../I thought it'd be easy to step in and be... be like <subPlot.mf:him/her/them>. I don't know why I thought that. My [i]feet[] just hurt. But. I know that's only the beginning./[face:happy]I like to think <subPlot.mf:he's/she's/they're> listening, sometimes. Not [i]all[] the time. 'Cause I say some really stupid things, but.../[face:skeptical]Well. It's hard to think what I even want out of all this. But I'll get it. I feel weirdly sure I'll get it, I guess./[face:neutral]I'm jealous of the people who got to know <subPlot.mf:him/her/them>. Resent them, even. A little. And I'm sorry for that feeling. Feel like I should be up front about it./[face:joy]Wouldn't hurt for <subPlot.mf:him/her/them> to give me some guidance. Ghost-<subPlot.mf:dads/moms/parents> ought to be able to do that much, wouldn't you think? Didn't even leave me <subPlot.mf:his/her/their> bow./[face:talking]Yeah, <subPlot.mf:his/her/their> journals sounded like someone who wasn't entirely sure why <subPlot.mf:he was doing what he was doing/she was doing what she was doing/they were doing what they were doing>. But <subPlot.mf:he loved his friends/she loved her friends/they loved their friends>. And family. And I think we were ultimately <subPlot.mf:his/her/their> reason./[face:neutral]I don't know why I never feel finished talking about <subPlot.mf:him/her/them>./[face:grim]The way <subPlot.mf:his/her/their> journals went, <subPlot.mf:he/she/they> felt a little trapped, I think. In the violence, in the role. Being people's hero. Death can mean freedom, I think. I hope. For <subPlot.mf:him/her/them>./[face:happy]There'll be a day I can look at my hands and say they're as skilled as <subPlot.mf:his/hers/theirs> were. Look at my heart and say it knows what <subPlot.mf:his/hers/theirs> knew, loves like <subPlot.mf:his/hers/theirs> loved. I look forward to that day./[face:dubious]It's complicated with everyone. It's complicated not having your hero-<subPlot.mf:dad/mom/parent>, who, <subPlot.mf:he/she/they> had to go be a hero for other people. Go get <subPlot.mf:himself/herself/themself> killed.>
