~01~~panel_001~1_narration=Together, they push through the final finethreaded door.
~01~~panel_001~2_speech=[light]Deeven... here is surely...
~01~~panel_002~2_speech=[gray]I... think I'm going to puke my tail up.
~01~~panel_003~2_action=[gray][actionSmall]grc.
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=The egg-shaped opal glows. The silence it sheds sharpens the echo of each movement, each exhalation. Sleepy smoke parts off its curved surface, curls into the vaulted dark.
~01~~panel_005~2_action=[gray][actionSmall]zlllg!
~01~~panel_005~3_action=[green][actionSmall]Splack!
~01~~panel_005~4_speech=[light]Imagine all the happy heads, laid at peace among the foliage and ferns, never dreaming such a thing might exist.
~01~~panel_006~3_speech=[gray]Hec? I...
~01~~panel_007~4_speech=[light]Deeven Vrsawl? This is [i]your[] life's work.
~01~~panel_008~5_speech=[gray]Yes... it's the egg. It's like being able to reach out and touch... I never thought I would truly see it, Wingcen Pyarc. My teacher, my mentor, my [i]master[]... Drevsnac. Ought to have been here. He deserved to stand where I stand, and I wish I could speak to his ghost, and offer him that.
~01~~panel_009~4_speech=[light]It is because of [i]you[] that anyone stands here now. In the fossilglass chest of a... what must have been an [i]enormous[] dragon, gazing on its still smoldering heart, its egg.
~01~~panel_010~5_speech=[gray][small]Crm. It is early yet to call it fulfilled.
~01~~panel_011~4_speech=[light]Pride, now, Deeven Vrsawl. You are the last of your order, but have fulfilled their founding hope.
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=With the Thrixl dead, the mountain's dark artery is laid open.
~01~~panel_013~3_speech=[light]Warlord! You triumph. Your soldiers fought with courage.
~01~~panel_013~4_speech=[gray][small]Warlord.
~01~~panel_013~5_speech=[darkGray]I am surprised to return today. And finding you all disappeared under the ground. What is happen? Happened. What has happened? Tell me.
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=Convening in the private light, a short hike from the dig, Pyarc gives a brief retelling of the battle, and Vrsawl outlines what comes next.
~01~~panel_015~1_speech=[gray]Or, put more simpl--
~01~~panel_016~3_speech=[darkGray]There isn't need to explain it another way.
~01~~panel_016~4_action=[tan][actionSmall]strawc!
~01~~panel_017~1_speech=[gray]Well-understood, yes. Warlord.
~01~~panel_017~3_speech=[darkGray]A dragon is an exception-thing. A dragon to hatch from this egg, it must be nest-girded in dragonburned stones, and the ash of a Drauven hero.
~01~~panel_018.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[light]You overestimate me, Warlord. My question is just whether the Weldwall is truly the closest such place.
~01~~panel_018.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]Wingcen Pyarc. [i]You stand in beacon quiet, signalling to me the bright wondering behind your eyes.[] What thinking, or what's your insight on this?
~01~~panel_018.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~4_action=[blue][actionSmall]streec?
~01~~panel_019.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[light]Weldwall is far from our center, and close to unsettled lands. It is not distant from that place where we were last [i]defeated.[]
~01~~panel_019.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]Closest to meet these condish... what...? Conditions?
~01~~panel_020.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[gray]Oh, what a wonderful question.
~01~~panel_020.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]Wingcen Pyarc voices concern, Vrsawl. Can you think of anyplace [i]nearer?[] That will suit our purpose?
~01~~panel_021.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[gray]No.
~01~~panel_021.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~4_action=[tan][actionSmall]strec.
~01~~panel_022.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[light]But...
~01~~panel_022.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]Gwec. That satisfies me. I hope you will be listened to, Wingcen Pyarc, but Vrsawl knows this lore best. We will do as he instructs. You and I will go together, savac?
~01~~panel_024.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[light]Yes, Warlord.
~01~~panel_024.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]We will make my dragon a safe nest. Bigger force is needed to stay, to guard Vrsawl and egg. But you and I together is a great force itself. A small force is sometimes best. Smart.
~01~~panel_025.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[light]My chief wonder is whether the Weldwall is truly the closest such place.
~01~~panel_025.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]Did not Vrsawl say?
~01~~panel_025.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~4_action=[blue][actionSmall]streec?
~01~~panel_026.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[light]He did, Warlord. But I find the distance and danger of that place to be discomfitting. There is likely a better option cl--
~01~~panel_026.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]Are you a [i]Deeven[], Wingcen Pyarc? Now? Are you claiming to be as lore-fed as Vrsawl?
~01~~panel_027.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[light]No, Warlord. I only seek to take account of the lore he [i]does[] possess. Each step, thus far, we stride into night, on a shaded path, until he chooses to illuminate it. Simply put--
~01~~panel_027.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]Don't need! A simple-put thing! I understand you want to... to [i]measure[] it, the. To [i]measure[] his knowing and!
~01~~panel_028.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[light]I am corrected, Warlord.
~01~~panel_028.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]The fool thing would be if he knows a nearer place and doesn't tell us it. Why? Vrsawl is like a father to me.
~01~~panel_029.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]Wingcen, I should not lose my temper with you. Today is near its halfmark, and I am already tired. But as Vrsawl says, just do. It's sense. We will start when <season> dies.
~01~~panel_031.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[light]Yes, Warlord.
~01~~panel_031.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]You will come with me, Wingcen. We will make my dragon a safe nest. Bigger force will stay and guard Vrsawl and egg. It's sense.
~01~~panel_032~1_speech=[gray]He [i]is[] the Warlord.
~01~~panel_032~2_speech=[light]You heard him say it, I suppose? [i]His[] dragon.
~01~~panel_033~1_speech=[gray]You have my gratitude, Wingcen.
~01~~panel_034~2_speech=[light]He very much is. Vrsawl, I dislike the feeling I have. I hope... Gwec. Send for me, when you know what detail you will need. And any nest-girding required for the egg.
~01~~panel_035~2_speech=[light]I believe that I do. And you will have mine, \nif all proves as you say. Be safe, be wise.
~01~~panel_035~3_action=[actionSmall]perch.
~01~~panel_037~1_speech=[gray]Be safe, egg. \nBe wise, Trava.
~01~~panel_038~1_speech=[gray]All your hard flights will be worth it, friend.
~01~~panel_038~3_action=[darkGold][actionSmall]strawc!
