~01~~panel_002~3_hero=<hero.bookish/greedy/loner/poet/snark/60:Beauty is too easy a word, for something so complex, so multi-faceted. But it's still the [i]right[] one, isn't it?/I rarely recognized the beauty of \nthe forms... that the land takes./\nPeople throw around a word like beauty. I won't. But I like this view, I'll say./There are times honesty demands simplicity. \nThis place. It's beautiful. In a way I wouldn't have expected./Could I ever get away with staring across a horizon like this? Making a silhouette of myself, and just saying, softly: "It's beautiful."/There's beauty here, I think. \nEven if it's grim beauty.>

~01~~panel_005~2_speech=[light]How old are you, Styumpv?
~01~~panel_005~3_speech=[darkGray]Twenty-six circuits of the seasons, me, Shellodcen Pyarc. Commander.
~01~~panel_006~2_speech=[light]When I was twenty-six, I was already a wingknight, and I had saved my Warlord once. A wolfeyed Hyant named Zuvyac was my shield that day—an exile, but his sacrifice was honorable. Only the Veldvaren can know whether he was redeemed.

~01~~panel_013~2_speech=[light]You will not remember the Warlord who rose and fell, when I was sleekscaled and still in the soar of my youth. Thuvayn, he was called. He was a stubborn, smart, painproven Drauv, a warlord from the egg. A legend alive. I raced to join his ranks.
~01~~panel_014~2_speech=[light]For most of my life, I failed to realize the many ways our legends fool us. And I was a fool.
~01~~panel_015~2_speech=[light]You [i]do[] remember the great Deeven, Vrsawl, I hope? I was alike to him in that way. The Deeven believed so deep in stories. Myth, like the sky, is lush. I was Wingcen earlier than anyone. Imagination [i]is[] my mighty talent.
~01~~panel_015~3_speech=[darkGray]Yes, Shellodcen.
~01~~panel_016.(company_is_cvawn_gotDragonPoison)~4_hero=This venom that the Fenwalkers devised... was crafted from plants native to their small, wet, unwanted stretch of land. If more is needed, the recipe's in that book. I took the precaution of leaving copies with some of the hillfolks, in case we fall.
~01~~panel_017.(company_is_cvawn_gotDragonPoison)~4_hero=The compound, coating a weapon, will poison Dragonblood, and—as far as they knew, or as far as <hero.cvawn_hunter/cvawn_hunterChild:my ancestor/my ancestor/the first Fenspear> wrote—[i]only[] Dragonblood. It might not be smart to drink it though.
~01~~panel_017.(company_is_cvawn_gotDragonPoison)~5_hero3=[face:skeptical]Hopefully it washes off. I don't want to be the <hero3.mf:guy/lady/one> with the smelly <hero3.weaponType:blade/axe/weapon/spear/arrows/bolts/knife/staff/wand/arms>.
~01~~panel_018.(company_is_cvawn_gotDragonPoison)~4_narration=They smear their weapons in pasty Fen's Ichor. They don't bother to clean up their final camp: they'll return to it, or it'll be scattered by weather and time.
~01~~panel_018.(company_is_cvawn_gotDragonPoison)~5_narration=They unwrap a few fresh pieces they brought for today. \nThe best their people could supply.
~01~~panel_018.(company_is_cvawn_gotDragonPoison)~6_narration=The sun is climbing.

~01~~panel_020~2_speech=[light]If I was Myeshnac the Morrowseer. If I could backthrow a black javelin through the stars to plunge through the whelm of time... I would hurl it at the feet of my younger self. Tied to it, a braid of signal ribbons: fly away, Pyarc. Retreat. Do not stop. Find a far and other happiness. Go.
~01~~panel_020~3_speech=[small][darkGray]Yerc.
~01~~panel_021~2_thought=[light][small]But even [i]she...[] is just a story now.
