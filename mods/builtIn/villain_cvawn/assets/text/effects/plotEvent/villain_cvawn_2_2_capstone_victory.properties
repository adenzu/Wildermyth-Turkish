~01~~panel_001.(mystic_exists)~4_mystic=We'll... let's move together. Who knows how many more are left? We'll find the captives, at least.
~01~~panel_002.(mystic_is_missing)~3_hunter=All this death. And suffering. For what?
~01~~panel_003~2_speech=[gray][small]We should stop, Warlord. Rest by that rock formation. Rock-group. \nSee it? Because... This sky looks more injured than you.
~01~~panel_003~3_speech=[light][small]You should have chosen someone better.
~01~~panel_004~1_speech=[gray]He was who I had. Zuvyac was indebted to our order, his sentence of exile vouchsworn by my mentor. He's guarded Thuvayn secretly for nine years, unerring.
~01~~panel_004~2_action=[gray]Hrrng...
~01~~panel_005~1_speech=[light]He was an [i]egg-eater![] And you were lucky he was there in time. The Warlord's life--
~01~~panel_006~1_speech=[gray][i]No[], I [i]wasn't[] lucky. I told him to be where he was, and he was there. I made contingencies, and kept your Warlord alive. But [i]your[] intervention was late, Wingcen Pyarc.
~01~~panel_006~2_action=[tan]Strawc!
~01~~panel_006~3_speech=[light]You gave us no time. I only made it back as soon as I did because I heard fighting.
~01~~panel_007~1_speech=[gray]I... it was out of my hands. Those softskulls came in faster and stronger than... Zuvyac's dead. Our forces behind us massacred. It gives me no pleasure to say so... but there's a reason they won the last two wars. Drevsnac called them what they are: [i]beasts.[]
~01~~panel_007~2_action=[gray]zrrn...
~01~~panel_008~4_speech=[darkGray]Beast is what they say is Drauven. And Drauven is think them beast? So we are beasts together. A beast family, ripping at throats, roaring in darkness, whipping and mocking and chain-giving to each other whenever it. When. A sick and sad family. Is I think, now. We. All.
~01~~panel_009.(mystic_exists)~2_mystic=Did you find what they wanted you to find?
~01~~panel_010.(mystic_exists)~1_folk2=We dug out tunnels. Dug, and [i]mined.[] In and down. Down and in. Looking for things. Differences. [i]Old[] rock, the smallish one said.
~01~~panel_010.(mystic_exists)~2_hunter=<hunter.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:Old? Was there mention of any particular historical period?[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]You're brave to talk about it. \nOr I don't know. Is that easier?/[face:skeptical]Just old? Not a particular color \nor... I don't know. [i]Shine?[]/[face:talking]You don't need to tell us now./[face:angry]Those mudlicking doglizards!/<hunter.cvawn_sawThuvayn:That's how [i]he[] described it? The feathermaned one? Kind of reddish?/Was it a mangled translation, maybe?>/[face:neutral]That's... I don't know./[face:skeptical]But all you found was... [i]young[] rock?/[face:skeptical]Do you... know what that looks like?>
~01~~panel_011.(mystic_exists)~4_folk1=No. Our family didn't, anyway. We were kept in families, together. News got around, neighbor to neighbor, chain to chain. I think we would've heard something.
~01~~panel_011.(mystic_exists)~5_mystic=Hm. <mystic.cvawn_legacyMystic/cvawn_replacementMystic:Drevsnac. The Drauven loreseeker I once aided. The books he liked were full of lost legends. [i]Some[] dealt with the [i]old[] stone, that summoned mountains to itself. Those... were [i]remains.../I remember it was books on lore, Drevsnac showed interest in. So I was told. About [i]old[] stone that summoned mountains to itself. And that stone was really a... [i]remains.../It's only legends that can survive in solid rock. But there's legends I heard...\nof [i]old[] stone. Around which mountains rose. This stone was really [i]remains.[]>

~01~~panel_013.(mystic_is_missing)~1_folk2=We dug out tunnels. Dug, and [i]mined.[] In and down. Down and in. Looking for things. Differences. [i]Old[] rock, the smallish one said.
~01~~panel_013.(mystic_is_missing)~2_hunter=Did you find what they wanted you to find?
~01~~panel_014.(mystic_is_missing)~2_hunter=Hm.
~01~~panel_014.(mystic_is_missing)~4_folk1=No. Our family didn't, anyway. We were kept in families, together. News got around, neighbor to neighbor. I think we would've heard something.
~01~~panel_015~1_speech=[gray]Don't tread in these swamps, either of you. We're not ruined.
~01~~panel_015~3_speech=[light]Warlord Thuvayn, you make a picture. That is very grim. Please illuminate. Explain. Say. Do you think Drauven and Human is same?
~01~~panel_015~4_speech=[darkGray]I am meaning a thing I am difficult to say.
~01~~panel_016~1_speech=[gray]Still, you have loyal forces abroad, Warlord. [i]That[] site was only one of several hopes, and nearly exhausted, anyway. We'll go farther, now, to places [i]no one[] cares for. And if we must, we'll dig with Drauven arms. Our warriors need grinding, need [i]making tough,[] don't they?
~01~~panel_016~3_speech=[light][i]Why?
~01~~panel_017.(mystic_exists)~6_hunter=<mystic>... <hunter.cvawn_hunter:I grew up with Dragontales. <hunter.bookish/coward/greedy/healer/leader/loner/poet/romantic/60:I've invested lengths of my time studying mythologies and where they cross into realities.

~01~~panel_018.(mystic_is_missing)~6_hunter=It all reminds me of the old stories, now. \nBut that's silly. A word like [i]Dragon[]. Is silly.
~01~~panel_019~1_speech=[gray]And yet Dragons there [i]were,[] once. To we Drauven, they were mothers and fathers. Five dragons. One of each season, and the fifth, who went away from the world.

~01~~panel_021.(mystic_is_missing)~6_hunter=Under earth... and under rock...?
~01~~panel_022~1_speech=[gray]Under earth and under rock. Under unnumbered years. Dragonsflesh to stone decays, dragonhearts to opals hard, and there become their own life's egg, to spark in later days.
~01~~panel_023~6_hunter=Well. If they dig for dragons... they'll dig a long time, is my feeling. Least they'll do it with their own claws. Not human sweat and tears. Not slaves.
