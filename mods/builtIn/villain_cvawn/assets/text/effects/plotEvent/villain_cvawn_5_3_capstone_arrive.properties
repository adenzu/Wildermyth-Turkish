~01~~panel_001~1_narration=Summer Mountain.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=An old name, hung on those nailsharp and hothearted stones \nby hillpainters of one age or another.
~01~~panel_001~3_narration=The mountain trembles sometimes, trying to contain its explosive temper. The hummocks \nand young woods huddling near it are sweaty and bright. Nervous neighbors.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=<hero> and <hero2>,<hero4.exists: <hero3><hero5.exists: and <hero4>, <hero5>/ and <hero4>>/ and <hero3>>... all tuck misgivings under their tongues. They stretch their legs and make for the mountain's redblack roots.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Bristling lines lace the trails up to the \nsummit where the Dragon sits.

This was in order to--/...to Dragonking's mansion we go![face:joy]/[face:happy]Shh! Drink in that noise. Sometimes I really feel [i]made[] for this!/Dragons were the first artists. Their medium was manipulation, and they loved [i]all[] its forms. Cloudgatherers. Dollmakers.[face:talking]/Dragons were drama's originators. Pullers of strings and hearts. Theatrical, and [i]mean,[] in how they toyed with mortals...[face:interested]/In oldentimes, Dragons placed underlings in enemies' paths.

Right?/And you would still try to marry one. \n<hero2.awm:<random:Yldalee? Or Glindergast, was it?>/Dezmendr? Or Glyffrix, was it?>/To soften us up. Ensure victory.>

So let's save some fight for the summerbeast himself.>
~01~~panel_007~1_speech=[light]Listen to them clang and sing. They stomp and rattle your name. Listen to them cry and glirt, listen to their fearless love.
~01~~panel_007~2_speech=[orange]I [i]do[] hear them.
~01~~panel_008~1_speech=[light]I hope you will remember them, immortal. Lives seem numerous and little, from high up. Nearly nothing. But so do stars and planets appear from our far perch. If even a hundred stars went black, I believe you wouldâ€”
~01~~panel_008~2_speech=[orange]I'd notice the death of stars.
~01~~panel_010~1_speech=[light]Cvawn, the night you hatched, \nI realized the world had ended.
~01~~panel_011~6_speech=[darkGray]Cvawn, call me. [i]Titles[] are for creatures who crawl and crave authority. The truth of me is crown enough.
~01~~panel_011~7_speech=[light]I saw you would kill what is Drauven. Our society. A [i]new[] thing would grow in its corpse.
~01~~panel_012~1_speech=[light]I wanted that, because I was sure the world could be better. But... Gwec. I only ask you listen to the Drauven chanting. Before their voices fade.
~01~~panel_012~2_speech=[orange]You forget I am very [i]keen[] of hearing, Pyarc. I [i]do[] listen.
~01~~panel_013~2_speech=[orange]I hear you sighing. Gazing on the land and rule I gave you. You spoil \nyour failing heart with softening memories, and grow embittered. \nI love you, in my fierce unchanging way. But you regret loving me.
~01~~panel_014~1_speech=[light]That is why you no longer say [i]Sister?[]
~01~~panel_014~2_speech=[orange]That is why.
~01~~panel_015~1_speech=[light]Hyesht.
~01~~panel_016~1_speech=[light]Regret erodes nothing of a heartsgiving.\nWere all my love gone, oath would hold me here.
~01~~panel_016~2_speech=[orange]There is mortality's bloom: honor. Beautiful, ephemeral, and [i]so fragile.[] Perhaps you will teach me to grow my own, someday. You will mend this rift you've wrought, and live happy.
~01~~panel_017~1_speech=[light]Perhaps I will get that chance.
~01~~panel_017~2_speech=[orange]Know, Pyarc... [i]Sister...[] that I hope for it.
