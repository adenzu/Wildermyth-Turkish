That doesn't sound too scary./[face:happy]Sounds just like the kind of person you wouldn't take seriously enough./[face:skeptical]That good or bad? Know you tend to take what they give you. What if <hero3.mf:he baits/she baits/they bait> you?/[face:happy]Hm... maybe if <hero3.mf:he's/she's/they're> obnoxious enough about it, you'll actually get mad enough to win./[face:happy]Interesting match. My prediction is it ends quickly, with you either beating <hero3.mf:him/her/them> down, or lying face down in the dirt./[face:skeptical]Sounds like you have a handle on it. Which means you'll get surprised, probably./[face:interested]You [i]heard[] that, somewhere? You really want to win, huh?/Long as you don't get caught up in a philosophical discussion, sounds like a favorable matchup./[face:happy]<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man.

I can see it. A toned beauty with a golden mind./Good, it [i]is[] a woman. You won't feel impolite, interrupting her.>/You're going to fall in love with this person. I can see it. A toned beauty with a golden mind.>/You may not land many physical blows, but I'm sure your mockery will leave <hero3.mf:his/her/their> ego bruised.>/<hero2.personality:I'm sensing an overlong, overthought battle.[face:talking]/[face:interested]Oh [i]no.[] This'll be like watching two turtles trying to tickle each other./[face:happy]And I assume you're going to do something totally inappropriate to throw <hero3.mf:him/her/them> off, and get disqualified again?/[face:skeptical]That good or bad? You take what they give you, don't you? What if there's no opening?/Hm... and you're not exactly <hero2.mf:Lord/Queen/Chief> Brutalizer yourself.[face:interested]/[face:happy]Hmm... that... sounds like you're going to get pissed off and lose in a stupid way./[face:skeptical]Sometimes I think you take this too seriously./[face:interested]You're pretty engaged this year, huh?/Imagine you'll say it's a reflection of <hero3.mf:his/her/their> personality or something./<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man. You won't feel bad about going hard./The longer the fight, the better chance you'll fall in love with this man, and let him win. Smart.>/<hero2.awm:The longer the fight, the better chance you'll fall in love with this woman, and let her win. Smart./Good, it [i]is[] a woman. You won't feel bad about going hard.>/Hm. The longer the fight, the better chance you'll fall in love with this person, and let them win. Smart.>/Sound like you're taking it pretty seriously, this year.>/<hero2.personality:[face:skeptical]And yours is overthinking, trying to gauge how seriously your opponent will swing a quarterstaff./[face:talking]That's a good thing to hope./[face:skeptical]Huh... sounds like [i]you.[] This's going to turn into a comedy routine, I imagine./[face:skeptical]Well, I know you like to predict these things. But don't get ahead of yourself./[face:talking]You're going to have a hard time hitting this <hero3.mf:man/woman/person>, aren't you?/[face:skeptical]Might work on you, though. If <hero3.mf:he lampoons/she lampoons/they lampoon> you, you're not exactly... [i]cool-[]headed./[face:skeptical]That feels like a leap. You're not usually wrong, but I don't know. Maybe you're not quite able to fathom that kind of person is all./[face:interested]Can always hope, I guess. If <hero3.mf:he gets/she gets/they get> you to crack a smile, then, in my opinion, that should count as a win./This feels like one of your monologues. Whether humor might be someone's best survival tool./[face:happy]<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man. You won't feel compelled to laugh and lie for him./You're going to fall in love with this man. A roguish wit? A fighter's body? Good luck.>/<hero2.awm:You're going to fall in love with this woman.

To get folks like [i]you[] overthinking every twitch.[face:happy]/[face:skeptical]Hm. Well, good to go in knowing that. I know you'll already be extra cautious, right?/[face:skeptical]Trying to decide how you'd respond to a cheapshot. I feel like you'd just think it was funny./[face:skeptical]Sounds like an even match./Wonder if this'll be the first time I see you really lose it. You know, if you take a cheapshot?[face:interested]/[face:happy]Well, since you [i]like[] getting hit, I feel like you're sort of doomed, right?/[face:interested][i]Doesn't like getting hit[] sounds like a pretty common trait in folks. Dirty fighting's not your specialty, either./[face:interested]Yeah? I bet you'd have no qualms fighting a little dirty yourself./I like the idea of you lecturing this person on morality in the middle of the bout./<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man. You won't have a problem cheapshotting him back./A dirty-fighting man? Why do I feel like this ends with the two of you sharing an obscene kiss in the dust?>/<hero2.awm:A dirty-fighting woman? Why do I feel like this ends with the two of you sharing an obscene kiss in the dust?/Good, it [i]is[] a woman.  You won't have a problem cheapshotting her back.>/Fighting [i]dirty.[] Hm. Why do I feel like this ends with the two of you sharing an obscene kiss in the dust?>/Well, you're not one to trust even the most honorable, uh... like my dad. You don't even trust [i]him.[] You'll be fine.>/<hero2.personality:Knowing you, you'll get [i]yourself[] hurt, outmaneuvering <hero3.mf:him/her/them>.[face:happy]/[face:skeptical]Hm. Well, see, that doesn't sound as scary as yesterday's frothy-lip guy./[face:happy]If anyone invites a kind <hero3.mf:man/woman/person>'s violence, it's my friend <hero2>./[face:skeptical]Hm. Really though, I hope I don't feel bad rooting for you. No cheapshots, okay?/[face:dubious]Great. This'll be the longest fight ever. A couple bears trying to knock each other over without actually touching./[face:happy]Well, that sounds like you have the advantage. Which I guess means you'll get impatient and lose again./[face:neutral]I'm suddenly worried you'll take the loss, out of sheer respect./[face:interested]That's interesting. Think you can be aggressive in a fight like that?/I worry you'll start eulogizing this person, and lose out of some kind of... [i]it just feels right[] kind of thing./<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man. You won't have a problem being the aggressor./And of course, when he [i]does[] hold back, you'll take that as a sign of love, and surrender yourself.>/<hero2.awm:And of course, when she [i]does[] hold back, you'll take that as a sign of love, and surrender yourself./Good, it [i]is[] a woman.  You won't have a problem being the aggressor.>/And of course, when they [i]do[] hold back, you'll take that as a sign of love, and surrender yourself.>/Well, I'd be shocked if you turned sentimental now. So unless <hero3.mf:he's/she's/they're> far beyond you, should be yours to win.>/<hero2.personality:[face:skeptical]Yeah? Scheming up something? Long as you don't get overwhelmed, trying to outsmart <hero3.mf:him/her/them>./[face:interested]Yeah, long as you're not screaming and crying with this boar chasing you./[face:happy]Hot-tempered is a bad trait for someone trying to fight [i]you.[] You'll probably make <hero3.mf:him/her/them> explode without touching <hero3.mf:him/her/them>./[face:skeptical]Yeah, you have a shot, I'm sure. But you're not going to want to get hit./The question's whether you'll have the heart to take advantage of that.[face:interested]/[face:interested]Uck. It'll be a bloodbath, you two hammering on each other./[face:talking]Do you think of yourself as tricky? Not what I would call you./[face:neutral]You might handle that well. Long as the stage and this <hero3.mf:guy's/lady's/person's> noise doesn't rattle you./I feel like you probably have an inner dialogue going on about whether that's the right way to win./<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man. You won't get too wound up./I shudder to think how you'll respond to a [i]hot-tempered[] man.>/<hero2.awm:I shudder to think how you'll respond to a [i]hot-tempered[] woman./Good, it [i]is[] a woman. You won't get too wound up.>/I shudder to think how you'll respond to a [i]hot-tempered[] brawl.>/I imagine with you taking verbal swipes at <hero3.mf:him, he'll/her, she'll/them, they'll> blow up before it comes to blows. That your plan?>/<hero2.personality:Too bad. You're too lost in your [i]own[] stratagems to go predicting anyone else's.[face:happy]/[face:happy]So naturally, you're wondering what <hero3.mf:he's/she's/they've> been told about [i]you.[]/[face:happy]And I assume you're going to do something totally inappropriate to throw <hero3.mf:him/her/them> off, and get disqualified again?/[face:skeptical]That good or bad? You think you can exploit that?/The question's whether you'll have the heart to take advantage of that information.[face:interested]/[face:happy]Hmm... that... sounds like it may be a problem for an [i]impatient opponent.[]/[face:interested]Sounds like you'll be fighting a mirror./[face:interested]I'm going to assume you overheard that. Not like you to go gathering info./Well, if <hero3.mf:he's/she's/they're> learning about you, seems like <hero3.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> realize you're the opposite./<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man. You'll be less likely to go easy on him./Long as you don't fall in love with him, midfight.>/<hero2.awm:Long as you don't fall in love with her, midfight./Good, it [i]is[] a woman. You'll be less likely to go easy on her.>/Hm. For some reason, I see you falling in love with the person, and letting them win.>/Long as you actually trust your information, your intuition, you'll be okay. But...>/<hero2.personality:Hm,[face:skeptical] got to say, I don't like that for you. You're all about analyzing and predicting, I thought./[face:interested]Well, not ideal, maybe. But maybe also, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the disparity in skill?/[face:happy]If anyone can make a stoic <hero3.mf:man/woman/person> break, it's you./[face:skeptical]That good or bad? You strike me as someone who likes to know what's coming. In a fight, I mean./Hm. Well, maybe it'll help, if <hero3.mf:he's/she's/they're> dead in the eyes. You won't feel so sympathetic. Like last time.[face:skeptical]/[face:happy]Sounds like the opposite of you. The stoic and unpredictable part. Should be an interesting match./[face:talking]The way you size these people up is pretty interesting./[face:happy]Two mute, businesslike fighters, grunting and swinging at each other. Should be entertaining./Sounds like <hero3.mf:he intrigues/she intrigues/they intrigue> you. Like how you'd describe a strange animal./<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man. You won't be captured by his coy looks or his quiet voice./A quiet voice. Maybe even a pair of steely brooding eyes. I worry for you in this one. You'll fall for him, for sure.>/<hero2.awm:A quiet voice. Maybe even a pair of steely brooding eyes. I worry for you in this one. You'll fall for her, for sure./Good, it [i]is[] a woman.  You won't be captured by her coy looks or her quiet voice.>/A quiet voice. Maybe even a pair of steely brooding eyes. I worry for you, now. You'll fall for this person. I know it.>/Wow, it's just hitting me. How seriously you're taking it, this year. It's refreshing.[face:interested]>/<hero2.personality:[face:skeptical][i]You've[] studied form, yourself. And yeah, you're not maybe so graceful at it, but... I don't know./[face:skeptical]You sound like you're intimidated already. But... sounded the same before you won, yesterday. So who knows?/[face:interested]Wow, how [i]serious[] you sound, saying that. No jokes. Hmm.../[face:skeptical]There's that glint in your eye. You feel like there's something there to take advantage of./Hm. Well, remember. You should [i]try[] to hit <hero3.mf:him/her/them>. Can always bandage <hero3.mf:his/her/their> nose afterwards.[face:skeptical]/[face:talking]Yeah? Maybe an interesting contrast, the two of you. I wouldn't want to be the [i]artful[] one in that fight./[face:talking]You clearly are curious to see it. Feels like you're ready to [i]learn[] from this <hero3.mf:guy/lady/person>./[face:interested]That actually sounds like admiration. For another person. That's cute./Hm. Why do I feel like I'll be watching a dance, more than a fight?/<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man. His knowledge of [i]form[] shouldn't distract you./I worry for you in this one. His knowledge of [i]form[] feels like it'll play into the result, suddenly.>/<hero2.awm:I worry for you in this one. Her knowledge of [i]form[] feels like it'll play into the result, suddenly./Good, it [i]is[] a woman.  Her knowledge of [i]form[] shouldn't distract you.>/I worry for you in this one. This person's knowledge of [i]form[] feels like it'll play into the result, suddenly.>/Are you... being [i]earnest[] right now? Something must be wrong. Are you tired?[face:interested]>/<hero2.personality:[face:neutral]Hm. Sounds like a favorable match for you. Unless you overthink it./[face:skeptical]Long as you don't get intimidated by that... 'flair,' as you call it. Should be okay./[face:interested]Sounds like you admire <hero3.mf:the guy/the woman/this person>. Someone who uses their charms for favor, not for silliness./[face:talking]Sometimes you scare me. Picking out the weaknesses of these people. But I get it. You want to win./Course, you have to be willing to take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities, for them to matter./[face:talking]Wait, this [i]is[] a fun match. Impulsive, fierce-tempered <hero2>, against the dashing town flirt? Huh./[face:talking]Something in your voice. Like you're disappointed in this <hero3.mf:man/woman/person>... but also a little envious./[face:neutral]Some people don't mind a little company, <hero2>. Being sociable./[face:happy]There's a light in your eyes. You're intrigued./<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man. Sounds a little like you, actually. You'll hate him./This is going to devolve into a kissing match, first time you get locked up.>/<hero2.awm:This is going to devolve into a kissing match, first time you get locked up./Good, it [i]is[] a woman. Sounds a little like you, actually. You'll hate her.>/This is going to devolve into a kissing match, first time you get locked up.>/[face:interested]Whew... there's something different in your voice. It's like a cocktail of scorn and envy.>/<hero2.personality:[face:neutral]I like the idea of you not attempting to fool anyone. You're smart enough, but it's... anyway./[face:interested]Well, you're not exactly intimidating, but you do persevere. Maybe that'll be the difference./[face:talking]With your banter going, I bet you can get <hero3.mf:him/her/them> to throw in <hero3.mf:his/her/their> stick./[face:talking]Path to victory, then, is to go for the knuckles? Or what?/That might work out well. If you don't have to finish <hero3.mf:him/her/them> off, I mean.[face:talking]/[face:talking]Doesn't sound like a person I'd like to be. With boar-headed <hero2>, charging me./[face:talking]You sound confident. What if [i]you're[] who's easy to trick, and predict?/[face:talking]Well, one thing I've never seen you do is give up. Or try to fool someone, come to think of it./[face:skeptical]Sounds like someone... who'd find your dialogue annoying. You should try talking while you whack at each other./<hero3.mf:<hero2.awm:Good, it [i]is[] a man. I could just see you offering a lady encouragement, and getting swept off your feet./So what's going to happen is... you're going to get smitten, and tell him not to quit. And that's when he'll sweep your legs.>/<hero2.awm:So what's going to happen is... you're going to get smitten, and tell her not to quit.
