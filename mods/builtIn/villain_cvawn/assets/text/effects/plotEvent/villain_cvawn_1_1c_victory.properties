~01~prompt~panel_001~3_hunter=[small]They leave these forces to slow us. If they simply turned on us all at once... I'm not sure we'd stand much chance.
~01~prompt~panel_001~5_hero2=[gray]They think we have our own warband, <hunter>...
~01~prompt~panel_002~5_mystic=It's wilderlands out there. Not many friendly faces. And past <focus>, it's Drauven lands. We need to catch them before they reach that far border.
~01~prompt~panel_004~5_hero2=<hero2.personality:At some point, we need to remember the tenuousness of our reasoning. Why we began this [i]quest?[] What risk we run of death, and the fact that the odds are only stacking higher against us?/[face:interested]<mystic>, it's... we're [i]so far[] from <town>... and.../[face:skeptical]I mean, really, the fact we've chased them back to their lands... Isn't that basically like, we won? [i]I'd[] definitely say so./[face:talking]I mean, look, it's starting to feel like we have much less to gain than we've got to lose, right?/Look, I [i]do[] recognize the stakes, both personal and potentially... I don't know, historical? But my main concern is... I don't want any of you to die. Can we remember how [i]easily[] we could die?[face:sad]/How long are we going to throw ourselves in the fire, following whatever you say?[face:angry] I want to get [i]home[] someday./We need to take stock. We've come all this way, we've succeeded in driving the Drauven [i]out[] of our lands. Is it realistic to expect better results if we push our luck?/I'm not some herobones, fireheart, drauvenslayer. I fight because the art of combat is good for me. <hero2.cvawn_hunterRomanceTarget:And I'm here because the <hunter.mf:man/woman/person> I love is here./I'm good at [i]it[]. I'm here because my old friend wanted me here.> But there comes a time to turn home./[i]"Wisdom and foolishness: neither long survives its naming."[] I think that the spontanaeity and [i]enthusiasm[] of our chase has fooled them. It's now foolish of us to think the [i]fooling[] will continue./[face:skeptical]I want to go [i]home.[] <hero2.cvawn_hunterRomanceTarget:I follow my love, who follows you,/We're young and we're brave,> and [i]you're[] who should be encouraging us to stop. But you... you won't, will you? It's starting to make me question your character./[face:skeptical]I know. [i]I'm[] the unreasonable one. But hear me out... going home is fine. We [i]won.[] We going to keep fighting until we [i]lose?[]>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~3_hunter=<hunter.cvawn_romanceHero2:<hero2>,[face:interested] [i]I[] want to finish this. To follow through. I'm sorry. I [i]hear you,[] I do... but./After I've had my nose to their feet this whole way... I can't give up now. Sorry.[face:neutral] >
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hero3=<hero3.personality:The unreasonable thing would be to abandon <mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny> [i]now.[] I won't give up./[face:skeptical][i]I[] don't like the idea more than you. But <mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>'s... my <mystic.mf:dad/mom/renny>. So... I guess that's... all. [face:interested]/Oh, <mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>'s too old. Look at <mystic.mf:him/her/them>! Haggard as a maple tree! You'll let an old <mystic.mf:man/woman/fogey> go alone?[face:joy][mystic.face:dubious]/[face:skeptical]Fine. Give up. But don't expect any glory when <mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny> and I come back. <hero3.cvawn_hunterRomanceTarget:<hunter>?/>/[face:talking]<hero2>, I get it. But <mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny> needs us all. I'm going to help <mystic.mf:him/her/them>. And I hope you will, too./You a quitter, or a coward, suddenly? My <mystic.mf:dad/mom/renny> got us this far. Trust <mystic.mf:him/her/them>./You heard what <mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny> said. We came this far. I'm doing this for [i]<mystic.mf:him/her/them>.[]/<hero3.cvawn_hunterRomanceTarget:Me and <hunter> and <mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny> can do it, then. I'm <mystic.mf:his/her/their> <hero3.mf:son/daughter/child>. I'll keep going./Me and <mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny> can do it, then. I'm <mystic.mf:his/her/their> <hero3.mf:son/daughter/child>. I'll keep going.>/<mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>? I'll do this. Even if it's just you and me. [face:neutral]We are undeniably [i]fiercer[] with our pack./<mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>? I'll do this. Even if it's just you and me. <hero3.cvawn_hunterRomanceTarget:<hunter>? You're with me, aren't you?/You'll both regret it if you give up.>/<mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>'s too old to face them alone. You really going to make <mystic.mf:him/her/them>?[face:skeptical][mystic.face:skeptical]>
