~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=In the canyon of his hatching, Cvawn's enclave is a place of natural elegance. In ancient times, he says, he often rested here, and wrestled his siblings, and waged his pleasures on the world.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_speech=[light]Get off your haunches, dragon! \n<season> is for cloudtasting!
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_speech=[light]You can see a fine afternoon in the river valley. I was there two nights.\n<season:The apple trees shake, and give each gust a grand smell./The linden trees are never so fragrant as now, and the breeze is from the south. It cools the eyes, the neck./There is an ambrosia of snakeroot and pewter-rose. Good smells to count your dead by./Crisp evenings, the driftmoss thick-clumped and burnable.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~4_action=[light]*rustle*
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_speech=[orange]I know it's common for your kind to make an egg. [i]Many[] eggs.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_speech=[light]The flight itself is fun.
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_speech=[orange]Since I hatched, I've wondered whether you might make one.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_speech=[light]I am asked this a lot.
~01~prompt~panel_009~3_speech=[orange]You're a death-destined species, and you'll leave me alone soon. The egg is immortality. Obviously in [i]my[] case that meaning is truer.
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_speech=[light]I do not expect common questions from you, Cvawn. So. That is why my neckscales are edge to edge.
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_speech=[orange]He believes too much in the stories he was told. No Dragon has ever given life to another creature. Not because we can't. Just...
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_speech=[light]The Deeven Vrsawl claims his [i]Bale[] all bore Dragon blood. That he himself--
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_speech=[light]Can you?
~01~prompt~panel_013~3_speech=[orange]...No.
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_speech=[light]It does not surprise me. Poor Vrsawl.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_speech=[light]I will tell you something, Cvawn. Because you are like a little brother. I do not wish for eggs. We can choose to grow them, or we can choose not to. I choose not to.
~01~prompt~panel_015~3_speech=[orange][i]Mrecmat.[]
~01~prompt~panel_016~3_speech=[orange]But I wonder what I will do when you are dead.
~01~prompt~panel_017~3_speech=[orange]My true kin... I was the first of them to be slain. I remember that I fell on the spike of the fenwalker. I filled my dying jaws with [i]her,[] don't imagine I didn't. But so I bled to sleep. And slept a long time.
~01~prompt~panel_018~3_speech=[orange]I can only think they followed me to their eggs, my siblings. That I am the first reborn... is poetry, isn't it? Maybe it'll be the business of my life, then, when you're gone. To find them. And wake them, and...
~01~prompt~panel_019~3_speech=[orange]Yes. One day.
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_speech=[light]There are other Drauven I am sure you would take to, Cvawn. Yarsa is a young knight, he is smart, and honorable, and very funny. But today I am young enough to fly at your side. And now the <season:red spring dragonflies are scattering light upon/summer's gold dragonflies scatter light over/graybottle is climbing birches, gold leaves make sunny islands on/wintermoths all constellate silver and starlike over> the river--
~01~prompt~panel_020~3_speech=[orange]The [i]Deeven[] came here.
~01~prompt~panel_021~2_speech=[light]Vrsawl did?
~01~prompt~panel_021~3_speech=[orange]Did you not notice the chest?
~01~prompt~panel_022~3_speech=[orange]Have you ever seen so many wrought and useless things, Pyarc?
~01~prompt~panel_023~4_action=[white]flip!
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_hero2=<hero.pcfn.hero2:It doesn't make sense, <hero.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>.../Well, I'll tell you, kid, it doesn't make much sense./Does it make sense, though?/<hero2.rfln.hero:No, you must've misunderstood something./I don't know what it would [i]mean,[] I guess. What it would... stem from./You know, love, I... I'm just not \nsure what this would mean./Does it make sense, though?>>
~01~prompt~panel_025~3_npc2=All you have to do is come out to <subPlot> with me. Ask others.
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_hero2=<hero2.9ysoThan.hero:Maybe you've lived a bit longer, so I don't want to be... but. When have Drauven gotten greedy for gems and coins and things?/Or so, yeah. There's not a lot we can say for sure. But I've never heard of our uncle Drauv clutching after a gemstone, a coinpiece./Got some years on you, and [i]I[] never heard of our uncle Drauv clutching after a gemstone, a coinpiece. Or even an ornate weapon.>
~01~prompt~panel_026~2_hero=I hear you, but <npc2.mf:this man says/this woman says/this person says>--
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_npc2=Poor <npc.mf:Mister/Miss/Farmer> <npc.lastName> lost everything. Didn't even have much for them to take, on account of <npc.mf:his/her/their> second <npc.awm:wife/husband>. From <npc.mf:his/her/their> farm, down to the town proper...
~01~prompt~panel_028~3_npc2=...they slaughtered who stood against them, and rummaged and took the most gleaming things they found. Hardly any meat, lot of heirlooms. Gold, and silver, and jewels.
~01~prompt~panel_029~2_speech=[light]He is at an age with a sapdrinking svic, Vrsawl. He is still growing.
~01~prompt~panel_029~3_speech=[orange]Ascendancy sounds like a fair amount of effort, also.
~01~prompt~panel_029~4_speech=[gray]It's only the first such collection you can expect, mighty Cvawn! Now you're older, it's time for your ascendancy...!
~01~prompt~panel_030~3_speech=[orange][i]Ascendancy?[]
~01~prompt~panel_031~4_speech=[gray]It's [i]easier[] when you're young. Your joints are soft, your mind is strong.
~01~prompt~panel_032~2_speech=[light]Vrsawl. Deeven Vrsawl. Now you invite human animosity. I have noticed your shoulder is cold and bare since... since [i]that time.[] I wonder if your bird simply refuses to return to one who has betrayed his own swearing.
~01~prompt~panel_032~4_speech=[gray]Unfair. Trava was a good bird. \nA cougar likely snagged him.
~01~prompt~panel_033~3_speech=[orange]Could twenty such boxes be found? [i]Filled?[]
~01~prompt~panel_034~2_speech=[light]But letting the past be the past, I fail to see how a box of earthbrights--be they silver or sapphire--will serve Cvawn. What good ten such boxes will be, or twenty.
~01~prompt~panel_035~2_hero=...was meant to prevent another thing like this.
~01~prompt~panel_035~4_hero2=There's not really anyone else \nwho can fight them like we can.
~01~prompt~panel_035~7_hero3=It's a tall number for any militia to take on. Certainly if they're veteran Drauven. \nI thought the old Warlord's death, that boneheaded knight...
~01~prompt~panel_036~4_hero=And we [i]can[]. If we're all up to it.
~01~prompt~panel_036~5_hero3=I'm not in the [i]worst[] shape. <hero3.AGE_IN_YEARS.40:Not as young as before, though./\nCould leave the beer behind.>
~01~prompt~panel_036~6_npc2=Give me a battletrade, I can learn. I'm not far past my prime. I've got hoeinghands, farm shoulders, country knowledge, peat in my heart.
~01~prompt~panel_037~2_speech=[light]The Deeven has aged to transparency, has he not? \nHe hopes only to be around to bask in your glory.
~01~prompt~panel_037~4_speech=[gray]How long should you be held away from conflict, Cvawn? It is better for posterity that the Dragon [i]announce[] himself. Rather than be [i]found.[] Skulking amongst his nest-neateners.
~01~prompt~panel_038~2_speech=[light]You are the sun before the dawn still. The day will be everlong, and there is no reason to rush your rising. Breathe in the starlight, hear the song of things, and gain wisdom.
~01~prompt~panel_038~4_speech=[gray]What does the sun fear?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_speech=[orange]I don't wish to be a cringer. \nMy nation should burn bright.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~3_darken=+1 Drauven Calamity
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_speech=[orange]A dragon has no use for hurry. \nMy sister is right.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~3_darken=Cvawn, Pyarc: +1 Health and Armor
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~2_speech=[light]Cvawn, show me who calls you a [i]cringer,[] and we shall see which of you shrinks when standing eye to eye.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~3_speech=[orange]You weave me a riddle, Pyarc, perhaps not meaning to. \nFor the valor-weighing gaze I seek to satisfy is [i]my own.[]
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~3_speech=[orange]Is that so?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~4_speech=[gray]Your young wisdom reminds me of Pyarc [i]herself,[] Cvawn.\nIn [i]her[] youth, she would've counselled this course.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_speech=[light][small]Better to nest with a yolkspider.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~3_speech=[orange]You intrigue me, and I'm sure it's by design. Desperate-done, but you lay a dragonworthy lure. Alright. Tell me of Pyarc before I knew her as my sister and friend. Stay by me tonight, Deeven Vrsawl.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_hero=Pick it up, I guess.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~2_narration=Drauven raids continue that <season> and on, their audacity eclipsing all prior years within memory. They take what gleams to hoard in whatever halls and holes their new lord lurks in.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_hero=Let's see your swing.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~2_narration=The company is called again to arms. They must trace trails and topple outposts, track stolen treasures to a distant canyon. And there, a mythic maw awaits them.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~3_speech=[orange]I'm also uncertain what all this treasure will yield me. \nI like its luster. But it's not as if I can sleep upon it.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~3_speech=[orange][i]Colorful[] curtains?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~4_speech=[gray]Would you prefer we capture mattresses, great Cvawn? \nBlankets and pillows and curtains for your fearsome den?
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~2_narration=The audacity of the Drauven raids is never as high as it was that <season>, or the <season-1> that preceded it. But Drauven warriors are hot with imagining, and their eagerness to plunder gleaming things for their new lord does not fully ebb.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~4_hero=Pick it up, I guess.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_hero=Let's see your swing.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~2_narration=So the company is called again to arms. They must trace trails and topple outposts, track stolen treasures to a distant canyon. And there, a mythic maw awaits them.
