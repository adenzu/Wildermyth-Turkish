How long did you... have a thing for me?/<lover.bookish/coward/loner/60:Admittedly, I harbored some skepticism, as far as... well, as far as [i]this[]. Working out./[face:talking]Don't be alarmed when I say... I worried, and I [i]still[] worry... that this wouldn't work out. Or won't. Eventually. Um./[face:neutral]Now's as good a time as any to say... I didn't think this'd work out./[face:happy]I'll admit, I didn't know if this'd work out.>>/<hunter.waterlingRomance/npcRomance:Hey, <hunter>. So... you and that water <npc.mf:man/woman/person>. What's your plan, there?/Funny to think of you paired off./Randomly, I was thinking, <hunter>. About that trader's <npc.mf:boy/girl/kid>.>>

I just like the attention./[face:neutral]Oh. I'm... not. Ready to. Come out with something like that./[face:happy]There was [i]always[] that undercurrent of attraction. [i]Delicious tension.[] Wasn't there?/[face:skeptical]Umm, who says I did? I'm actually [i]using[] you. To bonk lizards./Longer than you think.[face:happy]>/<hunter.coward/greedy/goofball/loner/romantic/60:[face:interested]Hm? What're you referring to specifically? Is there some...?/[face:skeptical]Oh, [i]you[] weren't sure? [i]I'm[] who allowed it to happen./[face:happy]Okay. [i]What[] are you talking about?/[face:neutral]I'm pretty good at tracking./With [i]your[] body? It was [i]going[] to work out.[face:joke]/[face:talking]I'll assume you don't mean our expedition, but...>>/<hunter.waterlingRomance/npcRomance:Plan...[face:interested] Well. At least a two-season home there, I'd like to make./[face:skeptical]Why's that funny?/<hunter.bookish/goofball/hothead/loner/poet/romantic/snark/60:A [i]small[] bit of specificity is all I ask./[face:joke][i]That[] one? Or the other one?/[face:skeptical]Yeah? So what? Which one? Or like, also, [i]what?[]/[face:neutral]Um. Am I supposed to know which one?/[face:happy]Don't we all, sometimes. Uh, but which one?/[face:joy]Oh! Similar thing for me! I was randomly thinking about caves full of Drauven that want to murder us!/[face:skeptical]I was thinking about a meal some unspecific bears consumed. You [i]must[] know what I'm talking about./[face:interested]Hm? Who was the [i]traitor?>>>

That I'm glad this... I'm glad we're together, anyway. Even if it's out here./No, you don't have to say. It's just candy to me, hearing the details.>[hunter.face:happy]/<lover.goofball/loner/snark/60:[face:happy]Alright, alright! I'll let you think that, then. I fell for you when I saw your belt-collection. "That's [i]so many belts[]!" I said./[face:neutral]Oh, I [i]fully[] know. It's hard for me to understand why you chose me./[face:dubious]Yeah, I'm real lucky. Really won the lottery with [i]you.[]/[face:happy]Yeah, yeah. It's fine, I just... was thinking.

I guess it is, huh?[face:interested]/Only for [i]you.[] I have like, [i]six[] irons in the fire, you know?[face:dubious][hunter.face:joy]/I guess it's fine to admit that now, isn't it? \nSometimes I worry you'll miss that.[face:happy][hunter.face:interested]>/<lover.greedy/hothead/snark/60:[face:talking]Yes, yes.

So, how long is [i]that?[] I [i]crave[] to know, I'm [i]dying[] to know, you could say.[hunter.face:joy]/And while that's a cute thing to say, and it [i]sounds[] romantic... I can tell that you're dodging the question.[hunter.face:joy][lover.face:happy]/Oh. For me, it happened really recently. That's interesting.[face:neutral][hunter.face:skeptical]/So what you mean is you're going to be lame and not tell me.[face:dubious][hunter.face:joy]>>/<hunter.coward/greedy/goofball/loner/romantic/60:No, no, no. I don't know. I'm not used to things that last. Especially good things.[face:talking] So... But I... I love you. Actually. And. That's it. I guess.[hunter.face:interested]/[face:happy]Heh. Well, sure. Anyway, I'm still kind of surprised and weak with it, and... I want to say, just, that I hope we can make it last.[hunter.face:interested]/[face:joy]Shut up! I want to just tell you I love you, alright? Now we can get on with everything else.[hunter.face:joy]/[face:joy]You're so stupid sometimes. I [i]love[] you. And I'm saying... I want [i]that[] to... I mean, if we survive whatever's next, I...[hunter.face:interested]/[face:dubious]I thought you were supposed to be [i]romantic?[] Whatever. I guess I just love you, and I'm trying to say so. But now I suddenly have doubts.[hunter.face:joy]/[face:talking]I'm not talking about our journey. I mean, I [i]sort[] of am.

We were kids, of course./taught you all about coinage, and the different markets for things, and <lover.bookish/greedy/60:other merchantile things.

And you, for some reason, [i]liked[] that.>/always got into scrapes, always needed you to smooth things over with other kids, parents. Liked you. And you liked <npc.mf:him/her/them>./teased you mercilessly, always got you to yell or cry, or whatever. But always made you laugh about it afterwards. We were younger./used to follow you around, do things for you, ask your opinion on whatever. Admired you, I think. Wrote you poems./was the only person you looked forward to seeing, it seemed like. Only one you'd talk about when <npc.mf:he/she/they> wasn't there. Wrote poems, found you funny./always brought books of poetry from across the yondering, and you were always the first person <npc.mf:he/she/they> looked for./had this affectation.

And not if you waste money on armorplates or whatever./[face:happy]Aw, come on. I love you more than a cow in love with another cow loves that cow./[face:neutral]I love you now. Let's get married./[face:neutral]When this journey's over... I believe we'll find the romance in permanence.

~01~~panel_005~5_mystic=[gray]No one comes here. Old road went this way. Said yourself this's where their trail goes. It's likely part of how they penetrated so deep into peopled lands without raising alarm.
~01~~panel_005~7_hunter=[gray]Mm, yeah. Saw no one lurking. I still think this place is a little conspicuous.
~01~~panel_006~5_mystic=[gray]Put my awareness a ways down the tunnel. \nAnd I can tell it's populated.
