~01~~panel_008~1_speech=[light]Cvawn. What has happened here? So many are dead.

~01~~panel_015~5_speech=[light]Cvawn, it is not just the Deeven I hope to find. All these Drauven. I knew them. Good and brave. Colr, Tranyen. Mulsc. [i]Yarsa.[]
~01~~panel_016~2_speech=[orange]More humans will come. I was beset suddenly, with no chance to fight back. Cowardly, but even a coward can prop a spear upon her hip and point it skyward. Take me down the mountain!
