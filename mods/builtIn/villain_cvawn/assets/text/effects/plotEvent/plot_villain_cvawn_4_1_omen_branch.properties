~01~prompt~panel_001~6_hook=<hook.personality:Well, it's sunrise. That was the evillest variety of tests I could stack on you, and I will say... you adapted with unfortunate alacrity.[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]Alright, I'm convinced. Aren't you tired? I mean, look, I'm not [i]strictly[] hero material myself. I mean no one says I am./[face:joy]How are you not juggling your kneecaps yet? Aren't you [i]old[]!? I mean aren't tired? Alright, fine, that's funny./[face:skeptical]Look, I'm tired. I was thinking I'd dissuade you from coming, but it seems like I'm only going to dissuade myself./[face:happy]You really are determined, aren't you? Well, you made it to sunrise, and I did make that the objective./[face:joy]You don't quit, huh? See the sun coming up? Even [i]I'm[] pretty much worn out!/[face:talking]You know, it's sun-up already. I was wondering when you'd quit, and you just didn't. I admire that. Alright./[face:grim]You're still standing up. That's... pretty unusual, I'll admit. Alright, you can join./[face:neutral]It's dawn, <volunteer>. To be honest, I accepted you the moment you declared your intent. But sometimes a test is not about the result./[face:happy]You know, the sky's been above us this whole time. And you haven't made one pass at me. That's pretty admirable./[face:skeptical]Alright, I give up! I was pretty sure you'd have fainted, or punched me, or just walked away by this point. But I get it.> Guess the thing left is to decide on your role. <hook.whm:<hook.romantic.60:Fighting <volunteer.mf:men/women/folk> with a little silver in their hair? Are very attractive. To [i]some[] people, I mean./We can get you shaped up. Warrior-style, right?>/<hook.romantic.60:Ranger <volunteer.mf:men/women/folk> with a little silver in their hair? Are very attractive. To [i]some[] people, I mean./I can help you if it's hunting, tracking. Taking your first silken step, so to speak...>/<hook.romantic.60:<volunteer.mf:Warlocks/Witches/Spellcasters> with a little silver in their hair? Are very attractive. To [i]some[] people, I mean./You have an aptitude. Like mine. I think you could [i]be[] a mystic.>>
~01~prompt~panel_001~7_volunteer=<volunteer.personality:I've actually put extensive thought into this already.[face:talking]/[face:interested]Oh, I was... I mean I came into this pretty set on... well. I don't know, now./[face:joke]Oh, so... I know what most people would say. \nBut me? I'm still a little wildtouched./[face:skeptical]My decision is just... what am I best at, what can I make my next living in?/[face:happy]I'm happy with anything, really.\nHowever I can be of use./[face:angry]I've [i]got[] potential, right? I [i]knew[] it. For me, it's... how do I want my revenge to taste?/I'd like to fill a need, if I can. \nAssign me where you will.[face:neutral]/[face:grim]Hm. So I'm [i]in,[] then? I suppose in that case.../Life is only a segment of time, one thread in a great sheet. It doesn't matter how I pursue my purpose. It matters that I [i]achieve[] it.[face:neutral]/[face:interested]Do you know which one--really, your [i]honest[] opinion--which one [i]looks[] the best?/[face:dubious]Hey, <hook.mf:man/lady/<hook>>, what do I know?>
