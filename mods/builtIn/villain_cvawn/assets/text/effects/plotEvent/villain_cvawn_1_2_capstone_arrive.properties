~01~~panel_001~2_hunter=<hunter.hothead/leader/loner/60:[gray][face:grim]They're up in the ruin. Maybe accepting and preparing for the fight we're about to have./[gray]They're up in the ruin. Haven't [i]seen[] lookouts. But I think any hope of surprising them would be a false one./[gray]They rest in the ruin. Their \nnumbers tax their speed./[gray]We're [i]too[] close, now. They're almost \nright above us. In the ruin.>
~01~~panel_001~3_mystic=[gray]Then it happens today.
~01~~panel_002~3_mystic=<mystic.goofball/loner/snark/60:[gray][face:happy]If I had some kind of award, I'd give it to you.\nMade them look silly, trying to run from us./[gray]As a tracker, you're very good./[gray][face:skeptical]If I had some kind of award, I'd give it to you.\nHunting-craft, trail-tracking, all of it./[gray]You're as good a tracker as any I've met, <hunter.fullname>.>
~01~~panel_002~4_hunter=[gray]<hunter.personality:Fairly unremarkable work, I thought. Stuck to procedure. Did get to learn a few things, though. I'm glad for the experience./[face:interested]The thing I worry about now is... any life we lose among us... will feel firmly like my fault./[face:happy]Imagine having my gifts with bow and knife, my talent for trails, [i]and[] this beautiful face...!/[face:skeptical]I do hope praise isn't [i]all[] I get out of it./All of my skill would've mattered for nothing without your wisdom, and our two brave fighters, there. But thank you.[face:interested]/[face:happy]It's been well worth my time. Getting to test myself out here. My senses, and my bow, my knife./I relied on your wisdom. On [i]all[] of you. Hasn't been a safe road, but let's hope it's a satisfying one.[face:talking]/I don't mind it. The wilderness./The burden of a skill is the duty of its employ. But I won't say the challenges didn't thrill me./I do what I can. I ask nothing but a kind word, and remembrance.[face:happy]/[face:skeptical]Maybe you just haven't met enough trackers? Think anyone I know probably could've done this. But...>
~01~~panel_003~3_mystic=[gray]<hero3.cvawn_reconciledWithParent:Right. The danger of cornered animals and all. I [i]will[] say... you don't have to come. This's mostly my fight, here. And I know that. And I'm sorry I've driven you all this way./If we've truly caught our quarry... then this'll be the most dangerous moment. Please seriously consider. I know it feels late. But still... none of you have to go up there with me.>
~01~~panel_003~4_hero3=<hero3.cvawn_reconciledWithParent:[gray]<mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>. We stay together, right?/[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_004~3_mystic=[gray]Drevsnac. His power over flames is sudden and strong. \nHillfolks took to calling him Dragon. Or Old Goldenglare.
~01~~panel_005~6_hero2=[gray]We called my schoolmaster worse things. Here, don't go in front. \nLet the strongfolks up first.
~01~~panel_006~8_narration=A fortification was once carved halfway up a cliffside, where water used to flow.
~01~~panel_006~9_narration=Though its name only lives in the scattered air its builders breathed, its command \nof the territory has made it the site of strife ten times since it fell to ruin.
~01~~panel_007~10_speech=[gray][small]They'd truly chase us back into the egg! \nWhat could drive such [i]deathlust?[]
