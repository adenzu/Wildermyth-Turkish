~01~~panel_001~1_narration=On the other side of the brief wood... \n   there's no sign a camp was ever made here.
~01~~panel_001~2_hero2=<hero2.goofball/healer/hothead/leader/60:<maimedHero.exists:[face:happy]/[face:talking]>Not a very welcoming bunch./<maimedHero.exists:Got through. But not cheaply.[face:grim]/Seems like we got through that alright.[face:interested]>/[face:grim]This was a fake, huh? A feint?/[face:grim]Now we know [i]they[] know. That we're giving chase./They clearly know we're following.[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_002~2_mystic=<mystic.bookish/coward/goofball/leader/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:neutral]They burned driftmoss. Here's a fairly unuseful fact. Drauven have discerning noses, and prefer pleasant smells./[face:interested]Maybe better they split their force. If they can afford to throw that many away./<maimedHero.exists:[face:happy]/[face:talking]>Drauven party trick. Little driftmoss makes a lot of smoke. Least it smells nice./[face:grim]They may believe we have a stronger force than we do. That's good./[face:neutral]They burned driftmoss. Drauven have discerning noses, you know? They prefer a similar range of pleasant smells to our own./They burned driftmoss. For some reason, it always gave me pause... that Drauven have discerning noses. And prefer pleasant smells.[face:interested]/They burned driftmoss. One thing I'll say, Drauven have discerning noses. They prefer pleasant smells.[face:skeptical]/Fire was only meant to smoke. It's driftmoss.>
~01~~panel_003~3_hunter=False trail. Means we go back to the streambed. Our quarry must've traveled [i]up[] it, for a while. <hunter.bookish/greedy/hothead/loner/romantic/60:[face:grim]Disappointing breakdown in my process, to follow my eyes without questioning them./[face:skeptical]Anyone could've made this mistake. Followed a slimmer trail out of the water./[face:angry]Arg, I'm an idiot! I should've seen this group's prints were fewer.../[face:neutral]Was a decent trick. The trail looked more or less the same./I wish I'd been better. Didn't sense that this group was smaller.[face:interested]/I should've been able to tell this group's numbers were less.>
~01~~panel_003~4_hero3=<hunter.cvawn_romanceHero3:[face:interested]<hunter>, you're the only reason we've been gaining on them./<hero3.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/leader/poet/60:That's a discouraging failure by the chief tracker in the group./[face:interested]Yeah? What [i]else[] are you missing, do you think?/[face:skeptical]Wonder if you could track me? I'm actually pretty elusive./Maybe we ought to question whether it's worth continuing, then./[face:grim]You [i]have[] to be better, to give us a chance./[face:neutral]Overconfidence can cloud our vision. So can over-tiredness./Well why couldn't you tell?>>
~01~~panel_003~5_mystic=<hunter.cvawn_romanceHero3:Yes, your/<hunter.mf:His/Her/<hunter>'s>> guesses have been good, on the whole.
~01~~panel_003~6_hero2=<hunter.cvawn_romanceHero2:[small][face:neutral]<hunter>.../>
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=<maimedHero.exists:They take time to see to their injuries, and then they're underway again./It's a short stop for food, then they're underway again.>
~01~~panel_005~6_mystic=About <npc> and <npc3>? I was done, basically. \nIt was the end of the twenty-year conflict.
~01~~panel_005~7_hunter=<mystic>? You were talking about your past, before.
~01~~panel_006~3_hero3=Who's <npc3>?
~01~~panel_007~3_mystic=<npc3.fullname> was another fighter we ran with.
~01~~panel_008~3_mystic=Younger than <npc>. Closer to my age. \n<npc3.mf:He/She/They> always helped soften the hard times.
~01~~panel_010~3_mystic=Poor <npc3>... Now [i]there's[] someone your <mystic.awm:mother/father> lit up around. I don't know. Got questions [i]myself.[] Many of which I've never... really wanted to answer.
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=Backtracking, they reach the stream that night.
~01~~panel_011~7_hunter=<hunter.bookish/coward/healer/leader/loner/60:[face:talking]Waterways here carry silver from the mine up Mount Magehead. It's in the silt. In this moonlight, it's practically a glittering trail, up the bank. This's where they left the water./[face:interested]Okay, if I'm wrong again, I don't know. But the mud here's smoothed. Like it was done on purpose. So...? Think it's them?/[face:talking]They exited the water here, I think. They're masking their prints. But thanks to the moon, can see streaks of mudshine on these stones./[face:talking]This's what we're looking for. The mud's smooth. Masked. They exited the stream here. Bet their trail starts again in a hundred paces./[face:neutral]This's what I was looking for. The mud's smooth as honey. Masked. This's where they left the water./[i]There...[] something a little bigger than a salamander wiggled itself up this bank. This's our trail.[face:skeptical]>
