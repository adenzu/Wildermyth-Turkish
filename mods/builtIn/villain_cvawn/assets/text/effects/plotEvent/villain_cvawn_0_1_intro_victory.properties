Safe, and fed, and blanketed, and so on. But the adventurous part of me's convinced that out there's where I do the most good.../And I said yes, because why in the names of any gods listening would I say no? And I'd hate to be left behind, if I was you. [i]Either[] of you./And I said I would. I've honed a set of skills over the last few years that's made me an excellent living. But here's a chance to do something bigger. I [i]did[] hope you'd both come along./And it's not that I feel like it's my responsibility, alright? Let me make that clear. And nor do I think it makes me a hero. I just... It's a test. I want to see how I do out there./They say a skilled hand that never finds the challenge to which it's fit may as well be wood. I'm thinking at least the trek'll make for good mulling-time, and singing-time, and all the other sorts of times I collect./Assumed you two would want to come along, where the skies and squirrels don't recognize us, and we can have the joy of making our faces known and loved, even to strangers.[face:talking]/[face:skeptical]And yeah, I don't know. Maybe I just agreed because of how old <mystic.mf:he is/she is/they are>. I mean... look at <mystic.mf:him/her/them>. But also. Yeah. Part of me wants to know if I'm good enough.>
