~01~~panel_001~1_narration=A handful of Drauven holds the otherwise vacant summit.\nThey look small among the mountain's bloodyblack talons.
~01~~panel_001~2_hero=[face:grim][small]Where's the—?
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=Then, a crag dislodges itself. Clouds change course. Huge outspreading wings lift Cvawn off the mountain's sheer sides...
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=...relax his bulk with stunning lightness onto the broad plateau.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=His gaze lands on <hero2.exists:each face/<hero>'s face> like the flat of a forgehot blade. \nThe fumes up here, of oilsmoke, sulfur, souring flesh, make\nit hard to look at him... but blinking would take too much courage.
~01~~panel_003~2_narration=At last, the Dragon speaks.

~01~~panel_004~1_narration=He is matured, now. The rocks ring harmonically, vibrating to his voice. His warm insouciance thickens and slows the blood, making wax of muscles.

~01~~panel_005~5_speech=[orange]I take, from your silence, that I impress you? I ask you don't let yourselves be [i]cowed[]. Entertaining me is your goal, isn't it?
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=Furnace breezes steam their sweat away, but the stroke of the air is still a comfort. It's familiar, and of the world.
~01~~panel_007~5_speech=[orange]And <hero.mf:he was/she was/they were> [i]so[] close! How distressing. But yes, little barkless dog<hero2.exists:s/>, bravery means something different now. I've changed the definition.

~01~~panel_009~1_narration=Maybe it's Cvawn's gusty gloating that begins to blow the dreadmist away. \nOr it might be that these are simply heroes. Memories stir up in <hero2.exists:them/<hero.mf:him/her/them>>.

~01~~panel_009~3_narration=The paralysis of amazement and fear begins to leave them.
~01~~panel_010~6_speech=[orange]I think I must understand it, though. Perhaps now you hope to prostrate yourselves before me? To bend and wag, and call me a King? [i]Mrecmat.[] So tell me something, flamefuel.

~01~~panel_016~1_narration=It's primordial prespeech that comes out of him. A form of expression \nunfelt in this world since Yldalee of Winter was returned to her egg.
~01~~panel_016~2_narration=The salty words he says aren't important. This is emotion made real. Real as heat. \nEmotion given a place and state among the atomic rattle of Is and Isn't.
~01~~panel_016~3_narration=What Cvawn imparts is a crowded feeling: rage, fear, sorrow, bafflement. The furied uncomprehension of an unloved despot. All aged, fermented over eggbound eons.
~01~~panel_017~1_narration=This is prespeech, the true tongue of Dragons, the only one in which they cannot tell lies.
~01~~panel_018~1_narration=How perfectly clear things are, then. Today is the final day. \nFor Cvawn, or for humanity. Anything after becomes fate. \nA cord to be reeled onto history's spool.
