~01~~panel_050~6_npc=[large][darkRed]Kuh!
~01~~panel_051~3_action=[darkGray]Crash!!
~01~~panel_051~4_npc=I fought Drauven my whole career! Even the strongest and most cunning, I cut down! There are no mysteries left in them for me! Soon, [i]you[] will see that they are not so scary as you entered this arena supposing!
~01~~panel_052~8_hero2=[gray]Wh--?
~01~~panel_052~9_hunter=[gray]I'm not watching this.
~01~~panel_053~2_narration=The Drauv rises, gathers, waits for the fairmaster's signal to attack.
~01~~panel_054~3_narration=<npc.fullname> <npc.mf:clicks his/clicks her/clicks their> tongue.
~01~~panel_055~2_narration=And the Drauv rushes forward at theater speed. His course is straight and obvious.
~01~~panel_056~3_narration=But at that moment...
~01~~panel_056~4_action=[actionSmall][tan]strawc!\n[blue]streec!
~01~~panel_056~5_npc=[small]What's?!
~01~~panel_057~5_npc=[large][white]Yu...ugh.
~01~~panel_057~7_action=[cherry]klush!
~01~~panel_058~3_narration=There's no pulse of clarity for the fairmaster, <npc.fullname>.
~01~~panel_058~4_narration=<npc.mf:He falls/She falls/They fall> dead. The greatsword drops \nfrom already loosening fingers.
~01~~panel_058~7_action=[actionSmall][blue]woosh!
~01~~panel_059~4_action=[white][actionSmall]clang!
~01~~panel_060~1_narration=Every present pair of lungs holds still.
~01~~panel_061~5_speech=[gray]Gyid gyarc conth...
~01~~panel_062~2_narration=The Drauv bends for the sword.
~01~~panel_063~3_narration=And runs.
~01~~panel_064~1_narration=Peace shatters, then. \nBodies flood the paths.
~01~~panel_065~1_narration=As people flee, as fires spit and fly above the forest of tents, Drauven battlecries, foreign to most ears, riddle the air, blending with the screams of fairgoers and fairworkers. It's a choir of violence.
~01~~panel_065~4_action=[white][actionSmall]Yeep!
~01~~panel_065~5_action=[white]Eeeee!
~01~~panel_066~1_hero3=<hero2.cvawn_wonSparring:I don't have anything to swing.[face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_066~2_hero2=<hero2.cvawn_wonSparring:Time to see if this staff's the real deal./I don't have anything to swing.[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_066~3_hunter=My bow's back at camp.
~01~~panel_067~1_hero3=[small][gray]<hero3.bookish/coward/healer/hothead/leader/poet/romantic/60:A culmination of your lessons, <hero3>.../[face:interested]I could also... well./With care and courage...[face:interested]/[face:angry]Blood for blood./Courage. Wisdom. Fortitude./[face:neutral]I'll bury my fear./I'm not afraid./Not much choice.[face:skeptical]>
~01~~panel_067~2_hero2=<hero2.bookish/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/60:[small]Progressing outward from this point?/[face:joke]I'm ready to smell roast lizard./[face:angry]This's what I [i]trained[] for!/[face:grim]Stay by me./[face:grim]Huh./Mm.>
~01~~panel_067~4_mystic=Need weapons? <mystic.greedy/healer/leader/poet/romantic/60:Grab whatever's on a trading table, out there. It's all free, now./I can hopefully protect you, if you can follow and find some pretty quick./Stay behind <hero2.cvawn_wonSparring:<hero2>, here, and me./<hero3>, here, and me.> Until we find some./Let's lay you hold of some, as the Starthief says./Bet there's at least a few flame-licked shoptents out there, full of them./Place to find them's probably in among the flames.> <mystic.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:I'm conscripting you, here and now, to preserve innocent lives. Objections?/[face:grim]I think, as a group, we can at least try. To save who's savable, I mean./[face:skeptical]Then we'll see who's out there. Do the old rescuing bit. Okay?/Then go save a few folks, collect a few life debts. That's how this all works, if you're good enough./The Drauven aren't fangless, but it wouldn't be fun if they were. Let's go save lives!/Urg, I [i]told <npc.mf:him/her/them>[] it was all a doomed idea. Little did I know how it would come back on me./My job's basically to get in the way of trouble like this. I'm [i]not[] good at it. But... You [i]are[] all joining me, right?/Then we'll see who we can save. All agreed?>
