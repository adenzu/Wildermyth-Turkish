~01~~panel_001~3_hero3=Dragons are oldest.
~01~~panel_002~3_hero3=[light]Long before stone was ever stacked by meaning hands...
~01~~panel_003~3_hero3=From eggs in the earth, each in their seasonâ€”\nthere were five seasons, then, so five dragons.
~01~~panel_004~3_hero3=[light]...in the undecided colors of cosmic dawn, they stirred.
~01~~panel_005~3_hero3=The dragons shaped all the land. Mountain, hill, valley, coastline. \nAt first they were merely at play. Absent any design or intention.
~01~~panel_006~3_hero3=But as they matured, they began to carve with [i]great[] care and purpose. And they made all animals, and people were among these. So were Drauven. All things were more alike and felt closer kinship in those early days.
~01~~panel_007~3_hero3=[light]Long generations after, a dragon, Dezmendr, shared this story with Yooen. Yooen was the first human recorder of lore. And it's through retellings of a first text, since lost, that the legend survives.
~01~~panel_008~3_hero3=I don't know if it's true, or just another myth. \nIf the dragon was honest, if Yooen was [i]real.[]
~01~~panel_008~4_hero2=<hero2.bookish/healer/leader/loner/poet/60:All your study, these past few years... commendable.[face:interested]/These past few years... [face:happy]sounds like you really went for it. /[face:neutral]You know a [i]lot[] now. I'm impressed. Let's use it./[face:neutral]Mm. Sure. Can't trust most things we're told. \nBut sounds like you tried hard, learning all this./[face:neutral]The power of a story doesn't always come from its veracity./[face:interested]You've wisdomed hard, these past few years.>
~01~~panel_009~3_hero3=<hero3.personality:[face:interested]The thread-chasing, the [i]delving[]... has been wonderful./You realize some things about... our natures, maybe. You know?/[face:happy]My neck changed shape, you know?/Hoped there'd be maps to buried hoards. Helms, blades, shields of yore. But no I was just.../I will say, it's been a selfish way to spend my time.[face:interested] I hope I haven't been too holed up./Didn't think I had the patience, did you? But it's kept my head busy.[face:happy]/The task has served to keep me occupied. I do hope it was useful./It's been alright. Chasing books and artifacts, squatting in dusty places even spiders have given up on./It's given me an education in myself. The definition of [i]humanity[] that I carry. I mean.../It's been dry work. Lonely, too./It's weird, I... put legitimate effort into it. Kind of without expecting to. Just...> Digging up all this history. It ends with... There came a time, when [i]war[] was born between us. The first war. It's odd to imagine all the ages of this world before a war happened.
~01~~panel_010~3_hero3=<hero3.bookish/loner/poet/romantic/60:People painted of them. These images can articulate something of the impression dragons left. But only the impression. Truth filtered through form and imagination, brush and the painter's vocabulary./People painted of them. People do that. To me, it seems like... they abandoned their efforts to know and understand, in favor of... making a more comfortable fiction. More people-centered./People painted of them. These images can articulate something of the impression dragons left. But only the impression. Truth filtered through form and imagination, brush and the painter's vocabulary./People painted of them. You can feel all the dreaming that went into this. I think about... it's my [i]own[] way, too... our way of investing love and wonder in mysteries. Are we disappointed in our measured lives?/People painted them. Revered them. And I have to wonder how it came around to fighting, to our epics and heroes. I have to think the dragons had a part in that.>
~01~~panel_011~3_hero3=I guess... You want to see something in the art. You want to locate something specific and helpful. But I don't know if it's there.
~01~~panel_011~4_hero=[small]<hero2.pcfn.hero:Hey, <hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>/Hey, <hero2.mf:boy/girl/kiddo>/<hero2>/<hero2>>? <hero3.mf:He/She/They> finishing up <hero3.mf:his/her/their> speech? \nGood stuff, right? <hero4.exists:We're/I'm> about set to go.
~01~~panel_012~1_hero=Rain'll be welcome. Tamp down the dust. It'll make our open roads into mudtraps, though. <hero.cvawn_hunter/cvawn_hunterChild:My family/My family/The Fenspears>, in ancient days, lived in wetlands, swamps, at the margins of today's maps. Those're the places we have to search.
~01~~panel_013~1_narration=It'd been the hottest <season-2> and <season-1> anyone could remember, and <season> was turning out much the same.
~01~~panel_013~2_narration=Drauven activity had picked up along wild borders, and in the rougher, less warded territories. Fires had sprouted as from windblown seeds, random and raging.
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=Early on, it'd seemed like coincidence.
~01~~panel_014~2_narration=But then refugees had begun pouring in, bearing the bones of relatives and boxes of half-burnt belongings, smoky tales of ruin still bitter on their tongues.
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=With <hero3> insisting on bringing them to the painted cave, to see if it sparked any inspiration...
~01~~panel_016~1_narration=So the company had met again. To share what five years had taught them.
~01~~panel_016~2_narration=To reckon with the demands of the moment they were now in.
~01~~panel_017~1_narration=...<hero> had narrated a passage from <hero.cvawn_hunter/cvawn_hunterChild:<hero.mf:his/her/their> family's/<hero.mf:his/her/their> family's/the Fenspear> tomes.
~01~~panel_018~3_hero=[i]'Shoulder to spirit, she surely quivered, but she stared at mortality's proof. The Summerking stooped, his slashed body slathering <legend> in burning blood. Staunch, she stayed upright, and he in his battlepride struck.'[]
~01~~panel_019~3_hero=[i]'The weapon of the Fenwalkers made her death-decision easy: no other blow would've felled him. With starry wet cheeks, she stood and let his wrath waste her bones, all the weight he wielded then turned on himself.'
~01~~panel_019~4_hero3=<hero3.coward/goofball/hothead/loner/romantic/snark/80:[face:surprised]/[face:joke]/[face:angry]/[face:neutral]/[face:happy]/[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_019~5_hero2=<hero2.coward/goofball/hothead/loner/romantic/snark/80:[face:scared]/[face:happy]/[face:happy]/[face:neutral]/[face:happy]/[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]>
~01~~panel_020~6_hero=And it says they buried the weapon, afterwards. In a room made secret and secure. To be found again, if the dragons, as was their boast, would indeed be reformed in a future age.
~01~~panel_020~7_hero3=[face:skeptical]<hero3.cvawn_hunter/cvawn_hero2:That's our family. Stories in stories, secrets in secrets./That's <subPlot.exists:<subPlot>'s family,/the Fenspear family,> as I remember them. Stories in stories, secrets in secrets./And they didn't trust the location to their inheritors?>
~01~~panel_021~6_hero=<hero3.cvawn_hunter/cvawn_hero2:Maybe there's a record of the location somewhere. [i]I[] couldn't find one. But it's so [i]long[] ago... I doubt they knew what might be. That <hero.cvawn_hunterChild/cvawn_hunter:our/our/their> history would survive, and be safe enough./Maybe there's a record of the location somewhere. [i]I[] couldn't find one.

~01~~panel_021~8_hero2=Famous weapons draw warriors of all kinds. If they're used, they'll be [i]misused.[] Or destroyed, in time.
~01~~panel_022~2_hero2=We've heard enough accounts. Our dragon [i]wants[] us to know where he is. If we find this weapon first, good. If we don't, we still need to deal with him. The Drauven, too.
~01~~panel_023~3_hero4=<hero4.exists:There's always an argument... for skipping legends, and cutting straight to his throat. [face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_023~4_hero2=<hero4.exists:/There's always an argument... for skipping legends, and cutting straight to his throat. [face:grim]>
~01~~panel_023~5_hero2=<hero4.exists:He will have grown much stronger, \nin five years. And more wary.[face:grim]/>
~01~~panel_025~1_speech=[light]I hope they do take your challenge. I hope they hasten. May it cool your blood, to blacken their skulls.
~01~~panel_026~1_speech=[light]I would not burn down the forest in order to quiet an unfavorite crow.
~01~~panel_026~2_speech=[orange]Be patient, Pyarc. Understand I am old as the world, or nearly so. Revenge, to me, is vast and slow, firm and full.
~01~~panel_027~2_speech=[orange]Humans are not crows. They're a plague. A plague must be burned out, in order for the place it thrived to be fit for life. Fit for us again.
~01~~panel_028~1_speech=[light]My kind are hardy, and loyal. But not without needs. We shall need a place to grow. Even humanity... needs a place, I think.
~01~~panel_029~1_speech=[light]You know that we would be a [i]nation,[] Cvawn. If you would but deign to [i]lead us.[] Let our armies win your war. Avenge Vrsawl by being who he hoped you would be.
~01~~panel_029~2_speech=[orange]Someday, Pyarc... I promise that someday I will. But in order for my mind to know solace... I must first hoard blood, in quantity to answer the quality of that which I lost.
~01~~panel_030~3_hero3=It's not letting up.
~01~~panel_030~4_hero5=<hero5.exists:[small]<hero5.bookish/greedy/goofball/healer/poet/snark/60:The uncommon heat. Has produced some unique weather./[face:skeptical]I think I... left my rainbarrel covered. How annoying./[face:happy]Free cart-wash, at least./[face:interested]How many great and fateful journeys were started in poor health?/[face:neutral]If you try to love what the grass loves, you'll be happy./How can you tell?/No. It's not.>/>
~01~~panel_031~5_hero=Woods're just down the next hill. <hero.loner.60:Get that good canopy overhead. Starting fires is quick./Get that good canopy over us. And we'll get a fire going.>
~01~~panel_031~6_hero4=<hero4.exists:[small]<hero4.bookish/coward/greedy/hothead/leader/loner/60:It's alright. My books are all in oilskin./[face:interested]Am I wrong that the road used to be [i]straighter?[]/[face:skeptical]Still want to say... Whoever was supposed to bring the oilskin? Bad job./[face:dubious]Figures it rains on us [i]now.[] Wish I could save it up./This'll be an important rain. Don't let your hearts sink too low./I can already smell all you wetfolk. Packed in the tent. Bleh./Ah, the road.>/>
~01~~panel_032~1_narration=This rain will be one of a precious breed.
~01~~panel_032~2_narration=Out there, a dragon razes towns and raises fire.
~01~~panel_032~3_narration=The final confrontation approaches, and it's up to <hero>, <hero5.exists:<hero2>, and the rest,/<hero4.exists:and the rest,/<hero2>, and <hero3>, and whoever they can bring along>> whether to seek a lost weapon in the wilds, or to trust in their own gifts and go as soon as trails and the weather allow them... to Summer Mountain.
