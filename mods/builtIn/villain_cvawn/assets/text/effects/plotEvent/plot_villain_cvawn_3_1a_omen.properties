.longName=Into Fossil Mountain 
~01~~panel_001~2_speech=Here. The wall itself... [i]swallowed[] the Marasac.
~01~~panel_002~2_speech=[gray][small]None of the Deevens [i]I[] know.\n[]What's that smell?
~01~~panel_003~1_speech=[light]The most ancient places nurse an ancient hunger. So the Deevens say.
~01~~panel_004~1_speech=[light]Wingcen Pyarc!
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=Dawn was cold at the fifth excavation. The mountain had rung like \na bell all through the <season-1>. This morning, something changed.
~01~~panel_005~2_speech=He was standing there, where the shadows... almost, they... they [i]reach[] at you, Wingcen Pyarc.
~01~~panel_005~3_speech=[light]I am glad they are only shadows \nthen, and not spears.
~01~~panel_006~4_speech=[gray]Wingcen. I do begin to wonder if there was ever something you feared.
~01~~panel_007~3_speech=[light]I carried my shell much longer than others. I was [i]born[] afraid, Deeven Vrsawl. But training... it teaches bones the movements of courage. Bravery is a hope we have. When it fails, that is when training must take command.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=And then the Wingknight, Pyarc, turns and walks through solid rock.
~01~~panel_009~2_speech=Wingcen!
~01~~panel_010~3_speech=[gray]I'm not the one with the extrabig stick-axe. You go first.
~01~~panel_011~2_speech=Deeven! What do we do?
~01~~panel_012~1_narration=The wall doesn't open, so much as [b]allows[] passage.
~01~~panel_012~2_narration=The Drauven drip through, unsure what they'll see.
~01~~panel_012~4_speech=[light][small]Styumpv. Come forward in small soft steps. Hiss it along. \nThere are maggots in the meat.
~01~~panel_013~5_action=[blue][actionSmall]...scuttle...\n[aqua]    ...clisp...
~01~~panel_014~1_narration=The corpse of the Marasac lies still, full of punctures, in a pool of his own blood.
~01~~panel_014~4_speech=[gray][small]What's the--erc!?
~01~~panel_015~1_narration=Shapes laze across the glassy floor like crisp dead petals on still water.
~01~~panel_016~2_speech=[small]Bookblack?
~01~~panel_016~3_speech=[small][light]Quieter!
~01~~panel_016~4_speech=[gray]Now I know what I smelled. [i]Ink.[]
~01~~panel_016~5_speech=[gray][small]Bookblack, yes. The blood of these\ncreatures is said to smell the same.
~01~~panel_017~2_speech=[small]The Marasac must've gotten his death price from them.
~01~~panel_017~3_speech=[light][small]I once saw a spiderfly spin an archway out of light, and walk through it into oblivion. Stay within our guard, Deeven Vrsawl. Let's back out and assemble a few more...
~01~~panel_017~4_speech=[gray][small]I think we need to hurry. This may be the find we were hoping for. They're called whisperers-through-the-briar, and I know that's only a windstory, for kitlings, but--
~01~~panel_018~1_narration=A gentle chitter erodes the last words from her sentence. It's almost the sound of rain, and it almost seems to come from their anxious reflections in the glossy stone.
~01~~panel_018~2_narration=But then it rises to a clickerous drone...
~01~~panel_019~1_narration=...as calm heads turn, starbright eyes meet their own.
~01~~panel_020~2_speech=[small]I am your life's bolster, Wingcen!
~01~~panel_020~3_speech=[light][small]Or perhaps there is no time. Forward with me. Everyone. We are the Warlord's hand. This cave, he claims. We shall [i]take it.[]
~01~~panel_020~4_speech=[gray][small]Gwec.
