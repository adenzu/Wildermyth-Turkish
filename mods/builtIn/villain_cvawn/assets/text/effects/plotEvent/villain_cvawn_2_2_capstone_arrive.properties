~01~~panel_001~6_action=[darkGreen][actionSmall]hnc! drc!
~01~~panel_001~7_action=[maroon][actionSmall]Gwec.
~01~~panel_002~2_speech=[gray]Should not Wingcen Pyarc be bringing us this news?
~01~~panel_002~5_speech=[darkGray]Warlord! Your enemies are across <overlandTile.bghps:the goldstram/the goldswath/the goldvale/the goldwall/the goldstone>! Like skytrapped thunder, we--
~01~~panel_003~1_speech=[light]Quiet, Ayrden. Return to your post.
~01~~panel_003~6_action=[darkGray]Whumpf!
~01~~panel_004~5_speech=[darkGray]Hrc... the... Wingcen Pyarc is... \nI volunteered to come and...
~01~~panel_005.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[light]I submit my shame. I struggled, thinking to engage our foes myself. But instead... \nI have done as bidden. I am here to be given orders, or else rebuked.
~01~~panel_005.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]The Warlord isn't displeased, Wingcen Pyarc. Your battlethirst, he will always forgive.
~01~~panel_005.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[dark]Crc. Pyarc is. Crm. Struggle to what?
~01~~panel_006.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[light]You [i]must[] fight, Warlord. You will look weak if you do not.
~01~~panel_006.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]Warlord, I ask that you let others--
~01~~panel_006.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]Must fight! Is [i]my[] thinking.
~01~~panel_007.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]Yes! Warlord. And I ask that you let others abide here in the heights. Those with [i]wings[]. And those they command.
~01~~panel_007.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~6_action=[actionSmall][blue]streec.
~01~~panel_008.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[light]I see this is war-wisdom, suddenly.
~01~~panel_008.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]Your enemies will come to you among the chains and stones. We will cage them there, and you will triumph.
~01~~panel_008.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]This is. Smart-headed. Yes.
~01~~panel_009.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[light]And I will collect my troops.
~01~~panel_009.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray][i]I shall don my helm, as the <season:Vernal Queen wears her stormingcrown,/Summerking wears his antlered crown,/Autumn Father wears his garland encolored,/Winter Empress wears her prismic ice,> I shall...
~01~~panel_010.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~4_action=[white]Swwff!!
~01~~panel_011.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]I [i]do[] think the helmet looks good.
~01~~panel_011.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~5_action=[actionSmall][darkGold]strawc!
~01~~panel_012.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~6_narration=Thuvayn turns away, goes to arm himself and meet his foe.
~01~~panel_013.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~5_action=[actionSmall][gray]...thnickle, \nthnickle...
~01~~panel_014.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]Your task remains the same, Zuvyac. The Bale will call your debt paid, if your blade is needed.
~01~~panel_015.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[white]The [i]Bale[]... is only [i]you,[] Vrsnickle, Vrsawl. Do you belittle my brain? Debts cannot survive their creditors, you know...?
~01~~panel_016.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]Zuvyac, be...
~01~~panel_016.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~5_action=[actionSmall][darkGold]strawc!?\n[blue]streec!?
~01~~panel_017.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]Be wise.
~01~~panel_018.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]I am not toothless either.
~01~~panel_019.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[light]I submit my shame. I struggled, thinking to engage our foes myself. But instead... \nI have done as bidden. I am here to be given orders, or else rebuked.
~01~~panel_019.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]Be patient, Warlord. A Wingknight is usually a long talker.
~01~~panel_019.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]Crc. Crm. Always she. Similar to this. Saying much and fast. What is need to know? Fight?
~01~~panel_020.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[light]I... that... if I am bothered by a scaleskate, I lie myself still.
~01~~panel_020.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]In truth, I ask you to lean upon her youth-wisdom, her warrior's head. Wingcen Pyarc, we seek victory over a foe that is smaller than us, but pesky and hard to smash. Advise us.
~01~~panel_020.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~5_action=[actionSmall][blue]streec.
~01~~panel_021.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[light]Sff! I lie myself still, and tempt it with my armsflesh! When it lands to drink, even my [i]tail[] can strike it off!
~01~~panel_021.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]A Wingknight, Warlord Thuvayn, talks much, but not wastefully. They are our best and most brilliant, from the egg to the sky.
~01~~panel_022.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[light]It will require brutal speed on the part of my foot troop. I should be off.
~01~~panel_022.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray]Your enemies will come to [i]you,[] waiting among the chains and stones. We will cage them there, and you will triumph.
~01~~panel_022.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]This is. Smart-headed. Yes.
~01~~panel_023.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]In human words, in [i]softskull[] words:\n[actionSmall]Lure them into an ambush.
~01~~panel_023.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~5_action=[white]Swwff!!
~01~~panel_024.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~2_speech=[gray][actionSmall]Lurenden all in a bush.
~01~~panel_025.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~3_speech=[darkGray]I should get my helmet.
~01~~panel_025.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~5_action=[actionSmall][darkGold]strawc!
~01~~panel_026.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~6_narration=Thuvayn turns away, goes to meet his foe.

~01~~panel_035~1_narration=In the pit below, the Drauven warlord stands mountainous and strange. Sun gallops on his bonepale plates as he casts round for a neck to cut.
