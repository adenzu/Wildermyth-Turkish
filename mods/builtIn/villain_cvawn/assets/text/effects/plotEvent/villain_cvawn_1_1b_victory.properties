~01~~panel_001~2_hunter=Hunter's lodge up on the hill, hidden away. <hunter.goofball/loner/romantic/60:If you trust those dice-toothed tracksmen, they say Drauven camped here a while back. Left by daylight.[face:happy]/[face:grim]I [i]did[] have to ask. But. Someone said they [i]did[] hear Drauven in this wood. And that they left in full daylight./One <hunter.awm:grim-eyed and figure-blessed trackswoman/grim-eyed and tall stone-jawed tracksman>, I coaxed into talking. Said Drauven camped here recently. Left by daylight.[face:happy]<hero2.cvawn_hunterRomanceTarget:[hero2.face:dubious]/><hero3.cvawn_hunterRomanceTarget:[hero3.face:dubious]/>/Folks there say Drauven fled from here a while ago. By daylight.> Timeline matches well to ours.
~01~~panel_002~1_hero3=Our timeline, huh?
~01~~panel_002~2_hero2=Hm.
~01~~panel_003~2_hunter=Yeah.
~01~~panel_004~1_mystic=Well, I've known a night or two, like this one. [navy][i]Music-barren.
~01~~panel_005~1_mystic=[i][navy]When the woods stand shy to wave in the windless air, with moon and star buried in their thick, fragrant hair, I'll tell you a story that was told to me in trust, of the [i][forest]Emerald Lady[] whose f--
~01~~panel_005~2_hero3=No, <mystic.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>.
~01~~panel_007~2_hero3=<hero3.coward/healer/leader/loner/poet/60:I'm not imagining it, am I?[face:interested] <mystic.mf:He shuts up whenever I say [i]'Dad'[]/She shuts up whenever I say [i]'Mom'[]/They shut up whenever I say [i]'Renny'[]>./[face:talking]I'm not sure if it injures me more, or you. \nWhen I call you <mystic.mf:[i]'Dad'[]/[i]'Mom'[]/[i]'Renny'[]>, and you turn into a stone./You practically turn colors, whenever I call you <mystic.mf:[i]'Dad'[]/[i]'Mom'[]/[i]'Renny'[]>.[face:talking]/See how <mystic.mf:he shuts up when I say [i]'Dad'[]/she shuts up when I say [i]'Mom'[]/they shut up when I say [i]'Renny'[]>?[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]Like a guilty dog, when its master comes home to a wrecked house. The way you silent up, when I call you <mystic.mf:[i]'Dad'[]/[i]'Mom'[]/[i]'Renny'[]>./Look, <mystic.mf:he shuts up when I say [i]'Dad'[]/she shuts up when I say [i]'Mom'[]/they shut up when I say [i]'Renny'[]>!>

~01~~panel_008~3_hero2=But anyway, yeah.
~01~~panel_009~2_hero2=<hero2.bookish/coward/healer/poet/romantic/60:I wish I felt this was an appropriate time for storytelling. I'd certainly be interested in hearing it [i]sometime.[] But.../[face:interested]Sometimes I feel like... we're told stories only to distract us from looking at... terrifying truths. And.../I hope I don't sound impatient. Even, I don't know. Disloyal? That's... Well, but I.../A story's a nice thing. A blanket to lay on a day that's done. But today, I.../Ask anyone who's flirted with me. A story well told will change my mind. But I'm not in the mood, suddenly./I'm not in the mood for stories, either.>
~01~~panel_010~2_hero2=Why're we still out here, <mystic>? Why's it so important for us to catch these Drauven? Is it about vengeance now? Because... I don't know.<hero2.bookish/coward/goofball/poet/60:[face:skeptical]/[face:interested]/[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/>
~01~~panel_011~3_hunter=<hunter.bookish/coward/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:And, delicately put, are we meant to [i]re-capture[] [b][i]that[][] Drauv? I'm not sure my sympathies lean that way...[face:grim]/[face:interested]Kind of thinking that, too. Though... I'm absorbed in my task, maybe./Yeah, and what're we getting out of it? I'm starting to wonder too./The [i]challenge[] is enough for me, I don't know![face:joy]/The challenge is enough for me./Think <mystic.mf:he's/she's/<mystic>'s> trying to avoid that one. You can hear <mystic.mf:him hold his breath./her hold her breath./them hold their breath.>/My feelings are similar. Though I admit the [i]challenge[] of it... is almost driving me now.>
~01~~panel_012~1_hero3=I won't say it for you.
~01~~panel_013~3_narration=The night's first breeze is felt. \nIt carries a damp scent.
~01~~panel_014~3_mystic=No. And you three have earned more from me than silence and staring. Alright. So let me start by saying... it's not about anything in the past. Or times gone by, graves filled in, lives spent, dreams fallowed. It's not about vengeance.
~01~~panel_015~2_mystic=Comes before vengeance. It's [i]love.[] Love for the world and people of the world. People already born, and bruised by years... and people that're glimmers in the ether, someday to open tiny wondering eyes.
~01~~panel_016~4_mystic=<mystic.coward/goofball/poet/romantic/60:[face:interested]I do... understand. It might sound sentimental. Ludicrous./[face:skeptical]And I get it. That's almost [i]humorously[] sentimental./It has the ring of sentimentality. In my mouth and in my ears./And you can call me sentimental. Call me a doe-feeder./And I know that sounds sentimental and ludicrous.> <mystic.coward/healer/hothead/leader/poet/romantic/60:It's... I'm not sure I'd fully trust anyone who presented it like that, I... but I.../I ask for your doubt and scrutiny. Because I know I can answer it in earnestness./I [i]welcome[] you to doubt me, because I know what you'll find./I welcome you to doubt me, because I know what you'll find./Maybe by now, you think I'll use words I don't mean, in order to speak beautifully. I promise you.../Maybe by now, you think I'll use words I don't mean, in order to speak beautifully. But I promise you.../And perhaps coming from me, it's hollow. Unbelievable.>
~01~~panel_017~2_mystic=I mean it more direly and seriously than I can really communicate. There's a Drauv with this host we hunt... who leaves only black timbers and burnt bones where homes stood. I tracked his passage to the area of the fairground... and I should've anticipated what he did, there.
~01~~panel_018~4_mystic=That's the name he gave me.
~01~~panel_019~4_mystic=[maroon][actionSmall]Drevsnac.
~01~~panel_020~2_mystic=A prisoner of ours, during the conflict. He spoke Yandric to me, and I taught him to read. Lent him mythologies, and, one stupid night... I turned him loose. He seemed to be a scholar. I thought myself marvellously kind. But his quest is for fire. Domination. And our end.

~01~~panel_022~2_speech=[gray]Thuvayn!! Get moving! The torches are lit for us, and we tempt discovery!
~01~~panel_023~1_narration=Slowed by their efforts to avoid detection and obscure their passage, Vrsawl's band makes for the understone causeway that first granted them entry here.
~01~~panel_024~1_speech=[gray]Haste is fear's remedy, Thuvayn! Haste! [small]Those fools! We're [i]days[] off...!
