.longName=Betrayal at Weldwall
.name=Event
~01~~panel_001~1_narration=Weldwall is the ruin of the Elnish city of Ooneth.
~01~~panel_001~2_narration=It smells faintly of eggs.
~01~~panel_001~3_narration=[ni][small][white]Warlord![]
~01~~panel_002~1_speech=[light]Warlord. Scouts have spotted softskulls. Down the wetroad, they come, protected by trunk and muck and murkflow.
~01~~panel_003.(company_is_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[darkGray]The Wingcen warned me this is possible. I hope she is at safe landing. But Vrsawl does not forget us.
~01~~panel_004.(company_NOT_cvawn_thuvaynChoosesPyarc)~1_speech=[darkGray]Sending the Wingcen away seems foolish, now. But it is as I said to her. Vrsawl does not forget us.
~01~~panel_005~4_speech=[darkGray]Up there is Trava, see? Trava is always a lucky vision for me. Since first I saw. \nGood marking. Symbol? Sign? Of the great fate that reached out for me.
~01~~panel_006~3_narration=The company approaches by way of a slim road that strays through sulfurous swamp.
~01~~panel_007~1_mystic=<mystic.krfln.hook:Good thinking on this one. They can't get to us in here./[face:skeptical]Well, this was actually smart. Good job. They can't get to us in here./It's good thinking, <hook>. We'll get inside the old walls without a fight./This was brilliant. We'll get inside the old walls without a fight./It's good thinking, <hook>. We'll get inside the old walls without a fight.>
~01~~panel_007~2_hook=<hook.cvawn_waterlingParent:[face:neutral]If I can walk by water, I will./<hook.bookish/coward/goofball/loner/romantic/60:[face:skeptical]That was the exact emphasis of my argument./[face:interested]What if that just means... they're all concentrated together? Wouldn't that be [i]bad?[]/[face:joy]My best ideas always involve mud! Slicky, icky, sticky old mud!/I know. That was the point./[face:happy]Myths are full of heroes trudging on mudpaths./[face:neutral]We'll see. Whether it works or not.>>
~01~~panel_008~4_hunter=<hunter.personality:The content of this air is unhealthy. In fact [i]most[] of this terrain bears the hallmarks of what they used to call, or what's translated as, [i]"Dragon disaster."[][face:skeptical]/[face:interested]You're alert for surprises, I hope? It all feels so laid out for us. And can't that be a bad thing? Like we're being lulled into a...? A deathtrap?/[face:happy]Well, I, for one, am pleased to finally be participating in lizard politics. I [i]like[] the short guy.[mystic.face:dubious]/[face:talking]I still think... the thing with colluding, when you can't trust your partner... you get this shiny burnished chest, it's often full of river rocks./It's all happening the way it was laid out for us.\nWhich I do find a little unnerving./[face:grim]I'm sick of feeling like we're following orders. Some kind of lizard politics at work./[face:grim]There's still something about all this... it feels like [i]we're[] following orders. I don't like that./There's no reason to trust things won't turn sour. If they take us seriously enough... maybe it was worth a long setup, to them. And some sacrifice.[face:neutral]/[face:neutral]We'll emerge from this whole ordeal with filthied feet and dirtied hands. But the world will be better for what we do here today.[mystic.face:grim]/I'll admit, I'm still... uncomfortable. With, that, we might be [i]colluding?[] I mean in a way that's sort of slimy and... not heroic?[face:skeptical] I don't know. If that makes sense. It's just[mystic.face:grim] a feeling./[face:neutral]It'll be a stroll in the grass, I'm sure.>
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=At the end of the path, the ruins begin. \nPast them swells a misted slope.
~01~~panel_009~2_hunter=[gray]Hilltops are for warlords. Can we survive the climb?
~01~~panel_009~3_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:[gray]<volunteer.coward/greedy/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]This's always the worst part./[face:grim][small]Place is a damp dustpile./No turning back now. Not that any of us should want to.[face:grim]/[face:talking]Those Drauven aren't unready. Expect the worst./[face:skeptical][small]I was picturing a bigger city. Guess a lot was buried?/[small][face:skeptical]Here's a fun scene. We never seem to catch them dancing./[small][face:talking][i]"And from stone, a ship was shorn, crowning the hill. A vessel on a voyage of stillness: ever at distance, ever at home.">/>
~01~~panel_010~2_mystic=[gray]Scatter his fires, shred his flags. \nAnd I wager he'll come down to us.
~01~~panel_010~3_hook=[gray][small]Threeskull ward.
